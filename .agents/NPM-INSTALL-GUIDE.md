# NPM Installation Guide - Ivey Education AI Agents

## For Coworkers: How to Install and Use

### Option 1: Quick Install (Recommended for First-Time Users)

Just run this command from any course project directory:

```bash
npx @ivey-edtech/ai-agents@latest
```

This will:
1. Download the agents temporarily
2. Run the interactive launcher
3. Let you choose which agent to run

**No permanent installation required!** Perfect for trying it out.

---

### Option 2: Global Install (For Regular Use)

If you'll use the agents frequently, install them globally:

```bash
npm install -g @ivey-edtech/ai-agents
```

Then you can run agents anytime with:

```bash
ivey-agents                  # Interactive menu
ivey-agents content-review modules/module-1/index.html
ivey-agents accessibility modules/module-1/widgets/revenue-builder.html
```

### Option 3: Project Install (For Course Development Teams)

If multiple people work on the same course project, add agents to your project:

```bash
cd /path/to/your-course-project
npm install --save-dev @ivey-edtech/ai-agents
```

Then anyone on the team can run:

```bash
npx ivey-agents
```

## Setup: Adding Your API Key

### Step 1: Get an Anthropic API Key

1. Go to https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Sign up or log in
3. Go to "API Keys" â†’ "Create Key"
4. Copy your key (starts with `sk-ant-...`)

### Step 2: Create .env File

In the `.agents` directory (or wherever you installed), create a `.env` file:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
```

**Security Note:** Never commit `.env` files to Git. They're automatically ignored.

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not found: ivey-agents"

**If using npx:**
```bash
npx @ivey-edtech/ai-agents --help
```

**If globally installed:**
```bash
npm install -g @ivey-edtech/ai-agents
```

### "Missing API key"

Create a `.env` file with:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
```

### "Module not found"

Make sure you're running from a course project directory with a `modules/` folder.

### "Permission denied"

On Mac/Linux, you may need to make CLI executable:
```bash
chmod +x node_modules/@ivey-edtech/ai-agents/cli.js
```
