## 🔄 **How Reports Are Updated**

### **Automatic (with File Watcher):**
1. You save a file (e.g., `property-selector.html`)
2. Watcher detects change after 3 seconds
3. Agents run automatically
4. **Reports are overwritten** with new results
5. Old reports are replaced (no history kept by default)

### **Manual Run:**
```bash
cd .agents
node accessibility-auditor.js "../modules/module-2/widgets/property-selector.html"
```
Creates/overwrites: `accessibility-report.md`

---

## 📂 **Report Organization Options**

### **Option 1: Current Setup (Simple)**
Reports stay in `.agents/` folder and get overwritten each run.

**Pros:**
- ✅ Always shows latest results
- ✅ No clutter
- ✅ Easy to find

**Cons:**
- ❌ No history
- ❌ Previous reports lost

---

### **Option 2: Archive Reports (Recommended)**

Move old reports to `reports/` subfolder before new runs:

```bash
# Manually archive before running
cd .agents
mkdir -p reports/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
mv *-report.md reports/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/ 2>/dev/null
npm run watch
```

**Folder structure:**
```
.agents/
├── accessibility-report.md          ← Latest
├── branding-report.md               ← Latest
├── widget-test-report.md            ← Latest
└── reports/                         ← Archive
    ├── 2025-10-01/
    │   ├── accessibility-report.md
    │   └── widget-test-report.md
    └── 2025-10-02/
        └── accessibility-report.md
```

---

### **Option 3: Timestamped Reports**

I can modify agents to create timestamped reports:
```
accessibility-report-2025-10-01-14-30.md
widget-test-report-2025-10-01-14-32.md
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Full history
- ✅ Track improvements over time

**Cons:**
- ❌ Many files to manage
- ❌ Need to find latest

---

## 👀 **How to View Reports**

### **Option 1: File Explorer**
1. Navigate to `.agents/` folder
2. Double-click any `*-report.md` file
3. Opens in your default markdown viewer

### **Option 2: VS Code**
1. Open VS Code
2. Navigate to `.agents/` folder
3. Click on report file
4. VS Code renders markdown with formatting

### **Option 3: GitHub (if pushed)**
- GitHub automatically renders `.md` files
- Nice formatting, easy to share with team

---

## 🔍 **Finding Specific Issues**

### **Search Across All Reports:**
```bash
cd .agents
grep -r "CRITICAL" *.md
grep -r "Failed" *.md
grep -r "❌" *.md
```

### **Check Latest Report:**
```bash
cd .agents
cat accessibility-report.md | head -50
```

---

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

### **1. Review Reports After Each Development Session**
```bash
cd .agents
ls -lt *.md  # Shows newest first
```

### **2. Fix Critical Issues First**
Look for:
- 🔴 **CRITICAL**
- ❌ **Failed**
- ⚠️  **High Priority**

### **3. Track Progress**
```bash
# Before fixing
cp accessibility-report.md accessibility-report-before.md

# After fixing
node accessibility-auditor.js "../your-file.html"

# Compare
diff accessibility-report-before.md accessibility-report.md
```

### **4. Share with Team**
```bash
# Copy to project root for visibility
cp .agents/*-report.md ../reports/
git add ../reports/
git commit -m "Add latest agent reports"
```

---

## 🚫 **Git Ignore**

Reports are automatically excluded from git via `.gitignore`:
```
*-report.md
reports/
```

**Why?**
- Reports are generated locally
- Each developer gets fresh reports
- Prevents merge conflicts
- Keeps repo clean

**To include in git** (if needed):
Remove those lines from `.gitignore`

---

## 📧 **Sharing Reports**

### **Copy to Clipboard:**
```bash
cd .agents
cat accessibility-report.md | clip  # Windows
```

### **Email:**
- Attach `*-report.md` files directly
- Or copy/paste content

### **Slack/Teams:**
```bash
# Format for chat:
cat accessibility-report.md
```

---

## 🔧 **Customizing Report Output**

Want different report locations? Edit the agent files:

```javascript
// In accessibility-auditor.js (around line 70)
Save the report as accessibility-report.md in the current directory.

// Change to:
Save the report as reports/accessibility-report-${new Date().toISOString()}.md
```
