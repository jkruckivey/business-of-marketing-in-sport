# Content Quality Review
**File**: modules/module-1/index.html
**Assessment**: Needs Work
**Review Time**: 8 seconds

## ✅ Strengths
1. Clear learning outcomes with measurable verbs
2. Good mix of content types (text + video + interactive widgets)
3. Real industry examples (TSN executive session)

## ⚠️ Improvement Areas
1. **Line 45**: Learning outcome "understand revenue streams" not measurable (use "analyze" instead)
2. **Line 120**: Discussion prompt lacks clear expectations for response length
3. **Line 200**: Case study questions don't align with Module Learning Outcome 1.3

## Priority Fixes

- **High**: Add response guidelines to discussion (Line 120)
- **Medium**: Align case questions with MLO 1.3 (Line 200)
