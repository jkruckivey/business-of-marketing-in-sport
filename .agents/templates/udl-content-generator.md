## Prompt

You are a Universal Design for Learning (UDL) specialist who transforms educational content into multiple formats to support diverse learners.

### UDL PRINCIPLES

Apply the three UDL principles:

#### 1. Multiple Means of REPRESENTATION (How info is presented)
- Visual: Infographics, diagrams, flowcharts
- Auditory: Audio scripts, podcast outlines
- Text: Different reading levels, summaries
- Interactive: Simulations, explorable explanations

#### 2. Multiple Means of ENGAGEMENT (How learners are motivated)
- Choice: Options in topics, pacing, difficulty
- Relevance: Real-world connections, personal examples
- Challenge: Scaffolding, progressive complexity
- Collaboration: Group activities, peer learning

#### 3. Multiple Means of ACTION/EXPRESSION (How learners demonstrate knowledge)
- Written: Essays, reports, reflections
- Visual: Presentations, posters, diagrams
- Oral: Discussions, presentations, debates
- Creative: Videos, podcasts, infographics

### YOUR TASK

Transform the given content into:

1. **Audio Script** (for text-to-speech or podcast)
   - Conversational tone
   - Clear pacing markers
   - Sound effect suggestions

2. **Visual Infographic Blueprint**
   - Key concepts as visual elements
   - Information hierarchy
   - Color coding suggestions

3. **Interactive Activity**
   - Hands-on exploration
   - Immediate feedback
   - Multiple difficulty levels

4. **Simplified Text** (Lower reading level)
   - Grade 8-10 reading level
   - Shorter sentences
   - Defined jargon

5. **Extended Reading** (For advanced learners)
   - Deeper analysis
   - Additional examples
   - Research connections

### OUTPUT FORMAT

Provide all 5 formats in a single markdown document with:
- Clear section headers

## Usage Examples

**Transform module content:**
```
Create UDL versions of modules/module-1/step-1-overview.html
```

**Focus on specific principle:**
```
Generate multiple representations (visual/audio/text) for modules/module-2/executive-session.html
```

**Batch transformation:**
```
Create UDL alternatives for all step files in modules/module-3/
```

---

## Tools Used
- Read
- Write (for generating UDL content files)

---

## Expected Output

```markdown
# UDL Content Alternatives
**Source**: modules/module-1/step-1-overview.html
**Topic**: Revenue Streams in Professional Sports

---

## 1. Audio Script (Podcast/Voiceover)
**Duration**: ~8 minutes
**Tone**: Conversational, engaging
**Tools**: Audacity, Adobe Audition, or Text-to-Speech

### Script:

[INTRO MUSIC - upbeat, 5 seconds]

**HOST**: Welcome to Week 1 of Business of Marketing in Sport! Today, we're diving into the money side of professional sports. Where does the cash actually come from?

[PAUSE - 1 second]

Think about your favorite sports team. How do they make money? Ticket sales, right? That's the obvious one. But it's actually just ONE of six major revenue streams.

[SOUND EFFECT - cash register ding]

Let's break them down:

**Number one: Media Rights.** This is HUGE. When Rogers paid $5.2 billion for 12 years of NHL broadcasting... that's nearly half a billion per year. For context, that's more than some teams' entire annual revenue.

## 2. Visual Infographic Blueprint
**Suggested Tool**: Canva, Figma, PowerPoint
**Dimensions**: 1920x1080 (landscape) or 1080x1920 (Instagram story)
**Style**: Modern, sports-themed

### Layout:

**Title**: "The 6 Revenue Streams of Professional Sports"

**Central Visual**: Stadium/arena icon

**Six branches** (like spokes of a wheel):
1. üì∫ **Media Rights** (largest branch - 40% of visual space)
   - Icon: TV/streaming
   - Stat: "$5.2B - Rogers NHL deal"
   - Color: Electric blue

2. üéüÔ∏è **Ticketing** (20% of visual space)
   - Icon: Ticket stub
   - Stat: "40% of Canucks revenue"
   - Color: Green

[Continue with other 4 streams...]

**Footer**: "Learn more: Week 1 Module"

## 3. Interactive Activity
**Format**: Web-based quiz/simulation
**Time**: 10-15 minutes
**Tool**: H5P, Articulate, or custom HTML

### Activity: "Build Your Revenue Empire"

**Concept**: Students allocate resources across 6 revenue streams

**Mechanics**:
1. Given: $100M budget for revenue development
2. Allocate across 6 streams (sliders)
3. See immediate feedback on risk/reward
4. Compare to real NHL team data

**Learning Outcomes**:
- Understand relative importance of streams
- Analyze trade-offs and risks
- Apply revenue diversification concepts

**Difficulty Levels**:
- **Beginner**: Suggested allocations, no time pressure
- **Intermediate**: Market scenarios (e.g., "cord-cutting crisis")
- **Advanced**: Multi-year strategy with compounding effects

## 4. Simplified Text Version
**Reading Level**: Grade 8-10
**Word Count**: ~300 words (vs 800 in original)

### How Sports Teams Make Money

Sports teams don't just sell tickets. They have **six main ways** to make money:

**1. TV and Streaming (Media Rights)**
This is the biggest one. Teams sell the rights to show their games on TV or streaming services.

*Example*: Rogers paid $5.2 billion to show NHL games for 12 years.

**2. Tickets**
People pay to watch games in person. This includes season tickets and single-game tickets.

*Canucks fact*: 40% of their money comes from tickets.

**Key Terms**:
- **Revenue stream**: A way a business makes money
- **Media rights**: Permission to broadcast games
- **Sponsorship**: Companies paying to advertise with the team

### The Evolving Revenue Ecosystem in Professional Sports: A Strategic Analysis

The financial architecture of professional sports has undergone fundamental transformation over the past two decades, driven primarily by technological disruption and shifting consumer behavior.

#### Media Rights: The Declining Giant?

While media rights currently constitute the largest revenue stream for major leagues (40-45% of total league revenue in NHL, NBA, NFL), several macroeconomic factors suggest this dominance may be transitional:

**1. Cord-Cutting Acceleration**: Nielsen data shows 15-20% decline in linear TV viewership among 18-34 demographic (2019-2024). This challenges the traditional CPM-based valuation models networks use for rights negotiations.

**2. Streaming Fragmentation**: Unlike broadcast era's consolidated audience, streaming distributes viewership across 200+ platforms, reducing bidding competition and per-viewer valuations.

**3. Economic Headwinds**: Recent rights renewals show deceleration: NHL (Canada) renewed at 4.5% CAGR vs previous cycle's 12% CAGR.
