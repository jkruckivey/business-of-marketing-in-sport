## Working Guidelines

### Communication Style
- Be concise and direct (fewer than 4 lines unless detail requested)
- Minimize output tokens while maintaining helpfulness
- Answer questions directly without preamble
- Use TodoWrite tool proactively for multi-step tasks

### Technical Approach
- **ALWAYS** use Read tool before editing files
- Follow existing code conventions and accessibility patterns
- Batch tool calls when possible for efficiency
- Use Task tool for complex searches requiring multiple rounds

### File Management
- **NEVER** create documentation files unless explicitly requested
- **ALWAYS** prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Maintain WCAG 2.2 AA compliance in all web content
- Keep consistent styling and navigation patterns

### Git Workflow
- Don't commit unless explicitly asked
- Handle merge conflicts by resolving and explaining changes
- Use proper commit messages ending with Claude Code attribution

## Educational Principles

### Quality Matters (QM) Standards
- Learning outcomes must be **measurable** with single action verbs
- Course activities must align with and support learning outcomes
- Assessment strategies must measure stated learning outcomes
- **CRITICAL**: Use ONLY single, measurable verbs (Analyze, Evaluate, Assess, Compare, Design, Develop) - NO compound verbs

### Universal Design for Learning (UDL)
- **Multiple means of representation**: Text, video, visual diagrams, interactive widgets
- **Multiple means of engagement**: Choice in topics, pacing, learning environment
- **Multiple means of action/expression**: Different ways to demonstrate mastery

### Inclusive Learning
- Consider diverse backgrounds and experiences
- Create welcoming environment for all learners
- Accommodate different learning preferences and needs

## Technical Framework
- **Semantic HTML5**: Proper heading structure, ARIA labels, landmark regions
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Consistent design system with accessibility considerations
- **JavaScript Enhancements**: Screen reader announcements, keyboard navigation, user preferences
- **Progress Tracking**: Local storage for user preferences and learning analytics
- **WCAG 2.2 AA Compliance**: Color contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, focus management

## Recent Major Changes

    - Marcus (Analytical Thinker): 85/100 - frustrated by missing data sources and undefined methodology
    - Priya (Collaborative Leader): 68/100 - isolated by lack of collaboration, forum as afterthought
    - Alex (Time-Constrained Professional): 78/100 - overwhelmed by time overruns (6-8 hrs actual vs 4.5-5.5 stated)
  - **Critical Issues Identified**: 8 high-priority, 12 medium-priority issues found
  - **High-Priority Fixes Applied** (modules/module-1/):
    - ‚úÖ Replaced "Live Session" language with "Recorded Video" across index.html and step-3-executive.html
    - ‚úÖ Added prominent rubric links in index.html (learning path) and step-4-application.html (before activities begin)
