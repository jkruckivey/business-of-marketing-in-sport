**Note**: All 5 modules (module-1 through module-5) belong to **Week 1**. The course uses "weeks" (Week 1-5), not "modules."

## Working Guidelines

### Communication Style
- Be concise and direct (fewer than 4 lines unless detail requested)
- Minimize output tokens while maintaining helpfulness
- Answer questions directly without preamble
- Use TodoWrite tool proactively for multi-step tasks

### Technical Approach
- **ALWAYS** use Read tool before editing files
- Follow existing code conventions and accessibility patterns
- Batch tool calls when possible for efficiency
- Use Task tool for complex searches requiring multiple rounds

### File Management
- **NEVER** create documentation files unless explicitly requested
- **ALWAYS** prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Maintain WCAG 2.2 AA compliance in all web content
- Keep consistent styling and navigation patterns

### Git Workflow
- Don't commit unless explicitly asked
- Handle merge conflicts by resolving and explaining changes
- Use proper commit messages ending with Claude Code attribution

## Educational Principles

### Quality Matters (QM) Standards
- Learning outcomes must be **measurable** with single action verbs
- Course activities must align with and support learning outcomes
- Assessment strategies must measure stated learning outcomes
- **CRITICAL**: Use ONLY single, measurable verbs (Analyze, Evaluate, Assess, Compare, Design, Develop) - NO compound verbs

### Universal Design for Learning (UDL)
- **Multiple means of representation**: Text, video, visual diagrams, interactive widgets
- **Multiple means of engagement**: Choice in topics, pacing, learning environment
- **Multiple means of action/expression**: Different ways to demonstrate mastery

### Inclusive Learning
- Consider diverse backgrounds and experiences
- Create welcoming environment for all learners
- Accommodate different learning preferences and needs

## Technical Framework
- **Semantic HTML5**: Proper heading structure, ARIA labels, landmark regions
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Consistent design system with accessibility considerations
- **JavaScript Enhancements**: Screen reader announcements, keyboard navigation, user preferences
- **Progress Tracking**: Local storage for user preferences and learning analytics
- **WCAG 2.2 AA Compliance**: Color contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, focus management

## Recent Major Changes

### 2025-10-09: Module 3 V3 Interactive Redesign
- **Problem**: Too much passive reading (~2,650 words)
- **Solution**: 8 interactive widgets replacing explanatory text
- **Result**: Text reduced 3,500 → 1,000 words, active engagement 5% → 75%
- **Widgets Built**: Revenue Mix Slider, Dynamic Pricing Simulator, Ecosystem Cascade Simulator (3 of 8 complete)
- **Content Workflow**: All text embedded directly in storyboards (Uplimit accepts markdown)

### 2025-10-09: Repository Reorganization
- **Change**: Moved from "module-1" through "module-5" folders to week-based structure
- **New Structure**: modules/week1/, modules/week2/, etc.
- **Reason**: Eliminate confusion (all 5 modules belong to Week 1)
- **Benefit**: Clear navigation, scales for future additions

### 2025-10-08: Student Journey Simulation
- **Ran**: 4-persona simulation (Visual Learner, Analytical Thinker, Collaborative Leader, Time-Constrained Professional)
- **Scores**: 72/100, 85/100, 68/100, 78/100
- **Fixes Applied**: Updated time estimates, added rubric links, replaced "Live Session" language, added case access notice

## AI Agents for QA
