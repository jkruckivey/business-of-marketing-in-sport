- **Key Requirements**:
  - Measurable learning outcomes aligned with activities (QM standard)
  - UDL principles implementation
  - Inclusive learning environment
  - HTML page structure with index as module landing page

### Educational Framework Integration
**Quality Matters (QM) Standards:**
- Learning outcomes must be measurable and clearly stated
