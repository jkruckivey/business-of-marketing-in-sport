- 2025-10-07: Claude Code Subagents v2.2.2 - Clarified Subagent Roles
  - **Description Updates**: Clarified distinction between rubric-generator and assessment-designer
    - **rubric-generator**: "QUICK rubric generation" - fast path for rubric-only tasks
    - **assessment-designer**: "Comprehensive assessment design" - strategic path with AI integration, UDL/QM compliance, research-backed guidance
  - **Cross-References Added**: Both subagents now reference each other in descriptions
    - rubric-generator → "For comprehensive assessment design with AI integration, use assessment-designer instead"
    - assessment-designer → "For quick rubric-only generation, use rubric-generator instead"

    - rubric-generator: "Fast rubric-only tasks without AI integration or UDL compliance needs"
    - assessment-designer: "Strategic assessment design, AI integration questions, compliance checking, alternative assessment exploration"
  - **Knowledge Base Highlighted**: README now mentions "464 KB of bundled frameworks and AI assessment research (9 files)"
  - **Recommendation**: Use assessment-designer first for most tasks (research knowledge, AI considerations, better recommendations)
    - Only use rubric-generator for literal "just need a rubric document" scenarios (rare)
    - Trade-off: 10-20 seconds slower but much higher quality

- 2025-10-08: Course Name Correction

  - **URL Slug Updated**: Changed all references from "business-of-marketing-in-sport" to "business-of-sports-marketing"

- 2025-10-08: Student Journey Simulation and High-Priority Fixes
  - **Student Journey Simulation**: Ran student-journey-simulator subagent on Module 1 with 4 personas
    - Sarah (Visual Learner): 72/100 - struggled with text-heavy content, no visual scaffolding
    - Marcus (Analytical Thinker): 85/100 - frustrated by missing data sources and undefined methodology
    - Priya (Collaborative Leader): 68/100 - isolated by lack of collaboration, forum as afterthought
    - Alex (Time-Constrained Professional): 78/100 - overwhelmed by time overruns (6-8 hrs actual vs 4.5-5.5 stated)
  - **Critical Issues Identified**: 8 high-priority, 12 medium-priority issues found
  - **High-Priority Fixes Applied** (modules/module-1/):
    - ✅ Replaced "Live Session" language with "Recorded Video" across index.html and step-3-executive.html
    - ✅ Added prominent rubric links in index.html (learning path) and step-4-application.html (before activities begin)
    - ✅ Recalibrated time estimates from 4.5-5.5 hours to 6-8 hours in step-1-overview.html
    - ✅ Added NHL Canucks case access notice in step-2-resources.html with warning that case is required
  - **Remaining Issues**: Missing primary source materials (case study, media reports), no visual content for visual learners, no collaborative activities for social learners
  - **Overall Module Assessment**: Strong pedagogical design with excellent rubrics and industry integration, but critical implementation gaps prevent full completion

- 2025-10-09: Week 1 Module 3 Redesign - Varied Content Delivery Implementation
  - **Content Delivery Problem Identified**: Module 3 had single 3,500-word text block (20+ minute reading), monotonous delivery, low engagement
  - **UDL-Based Redesign Solution**: Broke content into 14 varied elements while maintaining same learning time (~20 minutes)
    - **6 short text files** (200-650 words each, 2-5 minutes each reading) replacing one long document
    - **1 instructional video** (2 minutes) - Overview of 5 revenue streams
    - **2 images** with detailed specifications - Premium seating breakdown, Revenue ecosystem diagram
    - **2 infoboxes** - "Appointment viewing" insight (yellow), Betting growth statistics (purple)
    - **1 vertical list** - 5 revenue streams at a glance (scannable reference)
    - **1 table** - Revenue stream comparison matrix
    - **1 details accordion** - Sponsorship ROI measurement (optional depth)
  - **6 Markdown Text Files Created in modules/text-content/**:
    - `week1-revenue-intro.md` (200 words, 2 min) - Brief introduction to 5-stream concept
    - `week1-media-rights-deep-dive.md` (500 words, 3-4 min) - Media rights focused reading

  - **Storyboard Updated**: Applied complete redesign to uplimit-week1-storyboard.md Module 3 section
    - Replaced lines 206-332 with 14-element varied delivery structure
    - Added detailed content specifications for each element (infoboxes, images, video, details)
    - Included design rationale explaining pedagogical improvements
    - Documented student experience flow (read intro → watch video → scan list → read deep dive → see callout, etc.)
  - **UDL Principles Applied**:
    - Multiple means of representation: text, video, visual diagrams, interactive accordions
    - Strategic use of emphasis: infoboxes highlight critical insights at optimal moments
    - Optional progressive disclosure: Details accordion for interested students without overwhelming others
    - Digestible chunks: No single element exceeds 5 minutes of engagement time
  - **Student Experience Improvements**:
    - Visual breaks every 2-4 elements prevent cognitive overload
    - Different delivery modes maintain attention and engagement
    - Same total time investment (~20 minutes) but much higher retention expected
    - Scaffolded progression: intro → visual overview → focused deep dives → synthesis
  - **Files Modified**:
    - modules/uplimit-week1-storyboard.md (Module 3 section completely redesigned)
    - 6 new markdown files created in modules/text-content/
  - **Production Notes**:
    - 2 images need professional design or Canva creation (specs provided in storyboard)

- 2025-10-09: Module 3 V2 Redesign - FURTHER Reduced Text Density with Maximum Varied Delivery
  - **User Feedback**: Despite V1 redesign (14 elements), user reported "I am still finding that module 3 is very text heavy"
  - **V1 Problem Analysis**:
    - Still had 6 text blocks totaling ~2,600 words
    - Some text blocks were 4-5 minutes long (500-650 words)
    - Text clusters: Read 500 words → Read 600 words → Read 650 words = 13 minutes continuous reading
    - Only 2 images (often skipped as "recommended")
    - Single 2-minute video at start, then mostly text
  - **V2 Solution - 20 Elements with Strategic Visual Breaks**:
    - **Broke longer text blocks in half**: 500-650 word texts → 300-400 word chunks (2-3 minutes max)
    - **Added second video at midpoint**: Element 12 of 20 provides major mental break after ticketing content
    - **Added 2 new images**: Media rights timeline, Sponsorship activation pyramid (4 images total instead of 2)
    - **Added AI Chat Widget**: Interactive Q&A at end for active engagement
    - **No more than 2-3 consecutive text elements**: Visual/interactive break every 2-3 elements

    - `week1-revenue-interdependence-v2.md` (350 words, 2 min) - Shortened from 550 words, single detailed example (Connor McDavid)
    - Plus original: `week1-revenue-intro.md` (200 words, 2 min) - Unchanged
  - **Video 2 Script Created**: Sponsorship & Merchandising Overview (2 minutes)
    - Added to modules/video-scripts/week1-instructional-videos-2min.md
    - Covers brand-driven revenue streams (sponsorship + merchandising) at midpoint
    - Provides major visual break between ticketing and betting content
    - Script complete with timing (0:00-0:15 intro, 0:15-1:00 sponsorship, 1:00-1:45 merchandising, 1:45-2:00 conclusion)
  - **V2 Content Summary**:
    - **9 text blocks** (200, 300, 300, 350, 350, 400, 400, 350 words) - down from 6 blocks
    - **Total text**: ~2,650 words (similar total, but smaller chunks)

    - **4 images**: More visual reinforcement (media timeline, premium seating, sponsorship pyramid, ecosystem diagram)
    - **1 AI Chat Widget**: Interactive Q&A for student questions
    - **Total time**: ~23 minutes (slight increase from 20 min, but MUCH higher engagement)
  - **Student Experience Flow**:
    - Read intro (2 min) → Watch video (2 min) → Scan list + table (2 min) → Read media part 1 (2 min) → See image (1 min) → Read media part 2 (2 min) → See callout (1 min) → Read ticketing part 1 (2 min) → See image (1 min) → Read ticketing part 2 (3 min) → **WATCH VIDEO** (2 min) ⬅️ MAJOR BREAK → Read sponsorship (3 min) → See image (1 min) → Optional details (1 min) → Read merchandising/betting (3 min) → See callout (1 min) → Read ecosystem (2 min) → See image (1 min) → Optional AI Chat
  - **V2 Improvements Over V1**:
    - ✅ No text block exceeds 3 minutes (was 4-5 minutes)
    - ✅ Second video at midpoint provides major mental refresh
    - ✅ Visual/interactive element every 2-3 elements (was every 3-5)
    - ✅ 4 images instead of 2 for consistent visual reinforcement
    - ✅ AI Chat Widget for active engagement and student-driven questions
  - **Pedagogical Rationale**:

    - Addresses user concern: "still too text heavy"
    - No more long reading clusters (broken up with visual/video breaks)
    - Maintains same learning objectives and content depth
    - Dramatically improves engagement through strategic pacing

- 2025-10-09: Workflow Change - Embedded Markdown in Storyboards (No Separate Files)
  - **User Request**: "Rather than separate md files, can we put that text right into the storyboards? Uplimit lets me copy markdown and embed it right in easy peasy, so no reason to have separate files"
  - **Rationale**: Simplifies workflow since Uplimit accepts markdown directly via copy-paste
  - **Implementation**: Embedded all 7 text content blocks directly into uplimit-week1-storyboard.md
    - Element 1: Introduction Text (~200 words)
    - Element 5: Media Rights Part 1 (~300 words)
    - Element 7: Media Rights Part 2 (~300 words)
    - Element 9: Ticketing Part 1 (~350 words)
    - Element 11: Ticketing Part 2 (~400 words)
    - Element 13: Sponsorship (~400 words)

  - **Benefits**:
    - Single source of truth (storyboard contains all content)
    - No need to maintain separate text files
    - Easier to review full module flow in one document
    - Direct copy-paste workflow into Uplimit platform
  - **Files Modified**: modules/uplimit-week1-storyboard.md (all text elements updated with embedded content)
  - **Optional Cleanup**: Separate .md files in modules/text-content/ can now be deleted (content preserved in storyboard)

- 2025-10-09: Module 3 V3 Interactive Redesign - Replace Text with Interactive Widgets
  - **User Feedback**: "I think there's still too much long text. Let's use the other elements much more and let's also create some interactive widgets for simple demonstrations of concepts"
  - **V2 Problem Analysis**:
    - Despite V2 improvements, still had ~2,650 words across 9 text blocks
    - Student experience was 75% passive reading, only 25% active engagement
    - Cognitive load theory: Long explanatory text less effective than hands-on manipulation
  - **V3 Redesign Philosophy - "Show, Don't Tell"**:
    - Replace explanatory text with interactive demonstrations that let students discover concepts themselves
    - Design Principles: No text over 150 words, interactive widget every 2-3 elements, micro-learning approach
    - Student agency: Students manipulate variables and see outcomes in real-time
    - Progressive complexity: Start simple (sliders), build to complex (multi-scenario simulations)
  - **V3 Module 3 Structure - 30 Elements**:
    - **Text**: 9 blocks (100-120 words each) = ~1,000 words total (DOWN from 2,650)
    - **Videos**: 2 (4 minutes total)
    - **Interactive Widgets**: 8 (25 minutes total engagement time) ⬅️ **NEW**
