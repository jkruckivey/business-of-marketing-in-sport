    - Created SETUP.md with GitHub repository creation instructions
    - Updated package.json with proper metadata (repository URL, author, homepage)
    - Initial commit: 20 files (11 agent .js files, launcher system, documentation)
  - **Course Project Updates**:
    - Updated .agents/README.md with repository redirect and setup instructions
    - Added quick reference for running agents from new location
    - Maintained agent list and capabilities summary for reference
  - **Next Steps for User**:
    1. Create GitHub repository at https://github.com/new (name: ivey-education-agents)
    2. Push local repository to GitHub (commands in .agents/README.md)
    3. Verify repository is public and accessible
  - **Benefits of Split**:
    - Agents can be used across multiple course projects
    - Separate issue tracking and version control
    - Easier collaboration with other educational developers
    - Cleaner project structure for course-specific vs tool-specific code
