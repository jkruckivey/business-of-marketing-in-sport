    - Built complete frontend: index.html (gradient UI, agent cards, file upload, API key management)
    - Built frontend JavaScript: app.js (agent selection, tab switching, drag-and-drop, localStorage persistence)
    - Built backend API: api/run-agent.js (serverless function with 6 agent handlers using Anthropic SDK)
    - Created local test server: server.js (Express-based development server)
    - Added Express dependency to package.json (v4.21.2)
  - **Web Interface Features**:
    - Zero installation required (browser-based)
    - Three input methods: file upload with drag-and-drop, paste content, enter URL
    - 6 agents available: Content Reviewer (Haiku, 5-15s), Accessibility Auditor (Sonnet, 2-5min), Branding Checker (Sonnet), Widget Tester (Sonnet), Rubric Generator (Sonnet), Student Journey Simulator (Opus, 5-8min)
    - API key stored in browser localStorage (never sent to backend servers)
    - Loading states with estimated time, markdown-formatted results, download report functionality
    - Beautiful Ivey-branded design with gradient header and responsive layout
  - **Deployment Configuration**:
    - Created vercel.json for Vercel deployment (serverless functions)
    - Created netlify.toml for Netlify deployment (serverless functions)
    - Created web/package.json with dependencies (@anthropic-ai/sdk, express)
    - Created test-sample.html for testing agents (simple revenue calculator widget)
    - Created comprehensive README.md with quick start, testing instructions, troubleshooting
    - Created DEPLOYMENT.md with step-by-step Vercel/Netlify deployment guides
  - **Testing & Validation**:
    - Successfully started local server at http://localhost:3000
    - Verified Express installation and serverless function routing
    - Created test sample HTML file for agent validation
    - All 6 agent handlers implemented with appropriate Claude models (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus)
    - CORS headers configured for cross-origin browser access
  - **Files Created**:
    - web/index.html (485 lines) - Main interface with full UI
    - web/app.js (199 lines) - Frontend JavaScript with all interactions
    - web/api/run-agent.js (312 lines) - Backend API with 6 agent implementations
    - web/server.js (26 lines) - Local Express test server
    - web/test-sample.html (74 lines) - Sample widget for testing
    - web/package.json (23 lines) - Dependencies and scripts

    - web/README.md (108 lines) - Usage and testing documentation
    - web/DEPLOYMENT.md (195 lines) - Complete deployment guide for both platforms
  - **Rationale for Web Interface**:
    - Original .exe build failed due to ES module + Anthropic SDK incompatibility
    - Node.js installation too complex for non-technical users
    - Web interface provides zero-installation solution accessible via URL
    - Can be deployed for free on Vercel/Netlify with serverless functions
    - Perfect for Ivey EdTech Lab team members and course developers
  - **Next Steps**:
    - Deploy to Vercel or Netlify (both free for personal projects)
    - Share live URL with course development team
    - Monitor usage and API costs via hosting dashboard
    - Consider custom domain (e.g., agents.ivey.uwo.ca) for professional branding

- 2025-10-06: Module 2 Accessibility Enhancement
  - **Critical Accessibility Fixes Applied to modules/module-2/outline.html**:
    - Added skip navigation link (.skip-link) at top of page with keyboard focus reveal
    - Wrapped all content in <main id="main-content"> landmark region
    - Added focus styles for .nav a and .activity-button (3px solid outline with 2px offset)
    - Added aria-label attributes to all 4 widget launch buttons describing action and new window behavior
    - Added aria-hidden="true" to all 7 decorative <hr> elements to hide from screen readers
  - **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**:
    - Keyboard navigation: Skip link allows bypass of repeated navigation
    - Landmark regions: Main content properly identified for assistive technology
    - Focus indicators: Visible 3px outline meets 2.4.7 Focus Visible requirements
    - ARIA labels: Buttons provide clear context about widget functionality and behavior
    - Decorative elements: HR separators hidden from screen reader document flow
  - **Accessible UX Benefits**:
    - Screen reader users can skip to main content with single Tab keystroke
    - Keyboard-only users see clear focus indicators on all interactive elements
    - Widget buttons announce purpose ("Open [Widget Name] widget in new window")
    - Cleaner screen reader experience with decorative HR elements removed from navigation
    - Proper semantic HTML structure with <main> landmark supports AT quick navigation

- 2025-10-07: Claude Code Subagents v2.2.2 - Clarified Subagent Roles
  - **Description Updates**: Clarified distinction between rubric-generator and assessment-designer
    - **rubric-generator**: "QUICK rubric generation" - fast path for rubric-only tasks
    - **assessment-designer**: "Comprehensive assessment design" - strategic path with AI integration, UDL/QM compliance, research-backed guidance
  - **Cross-References Added**: Both subagents now reference each other in descriptions
    - rubric-generator → "For comprehensive assessment design with AI integration, use assessment-designer instead"
    - assessment-designer → "For quick rubric-only generation, use rubric-generator instead"

- 2025-10-08: Student Journey Simulation and High-Priority Fixes
  - **Student Journey Simulation**: Ran student-journey-simulator subagent on Module 1 with 4 personas
    - Sarah (Visual Learner): 72/100 - struggled with text-heavy content, no visual scaffolding
    - Marcus (Analytical Thinker): 85/100 - frustrated by missing data sources and undefined methodology
    - Priya (Collaborative Leader): 68/100 - isolated by lack of collaboration, forum as afterthought
    - Alex (Time-Constrained Professional): 78/100 - overwhelmed by time overruns (6-8 hrs actual vs 4.5-5.5 stated)
  - **Critical Issues Identified**: 8 high-priority, 12 medium-priority issues found
  - **High-Priority Fixes Applied** (modules/module-1/):
    - ✅ Replaced "Live Session" language with "Recorded Video" across index.html and step-3-executive.html
    - ✅ Added prominent rubric links in index.html (learning path) and step-4-application.html (before activities begin)
    - ✅ Recalibrated time estimates from 4.5-5.5 hours to 6-8 hours in step-1-overview.html
    - ✅ Added NHL Canucks case access notice in step-2-resources.html with warning that case is required
  - **Remaining Issues**: Missing primary source materials (case study, media reports), no visual content for visual learners, no collaborative activities for social learners
  - **Overall Module Assessment**: Strong pedagogical design with excellent rubrics and industry integration, but critical implementation gaps prevent full completion

- 2025-10-09: Week 1 Module 3 Redesign - Varied Content Delivery Implementation
  - **Content Delivery Problem Identified**: Module 3 had single 3,500-word text block (20+ minute reading), monotonous delivery, low engagement

    - **6 short text files** (200-650 words each, 2-5 minutes each reading) replacing one long document
    - **1 instructional video** (2 minutes) - Overview of 5 revenue streams
    - **2 images** with detailed specifications - Premium seating breakdown, Revenue ecosystem diagram
    - **2 infoboxes** - "Appointment viewing" insight (yellow), Betting growth statistics (purple)
    - **1 vertical list** - 5 revenue streams at a glance (scannable reference)
    - **1 table** - Revenue stream comparison matrix
    - **1 details accordion** - Sponsorship ROI measurement (optional depth)
  - **6 Markdown Text Files Created in modules/text-content/**:
    - `week1-revenue-intro.md` (200 words, 2 min) - Brief introduction to 5-stream concept
    - `week1-media-rights-deep-dive.md` (500 words, 3-4 min) - Media rights focused reading

  - **Storyboard Updated**: Applied complete redesign to uplimit-week1-storyboard.md Module 3 section
    - Replaced lines 206-332 with 14-element varied delivery structure
    - Added detailed content specifications for each element (infoboxes, images, video, details)
    - Included design rationale explaining pedagogical improvements
    - Documented student experience flow (read intro → watch video → scan list → read deep dive → see callout, etc.)
  - **UDL Principles Applied**:
    - Multiple means of representation: text, video, visual diagrams, interactive accordions
    - Strategic use of emphasis: infoboxes highlight critical insights at optimal moments
    - Optional progressive disclosure: Details accordion for interested students without overwhelming others
    - Digestible chunks: No single element exceeds 5 minutes of engagement time
  - **Student Experience Improvements**:
    - Visual breaks every 2-4 elements prevent cognitive overload
    - Different delivery modes maintain attention and engagement
    - Same total time investment (~20 minutes) but much higher retention expected
    - Scaffolded progression: intro → visual overview → focused deep dives → synthesis
  - **Files Modified**:
    - modules/uplimit-week1-storyboard.md (Module 3 section completely redesigned)
    - 6 new markdown files created in modules/text-content/

- 2025-10-09: Module 3 V2 Redesign - FURTHER Reduced Text Density with Maximum Varied Delivery
  - **User Feedback**: Despite V1 redesign (14 elements), user reported "I am still finding that module 3 is very text heavy"
  - **V1 Problem Analysis**:
    - Still had 6 text blocks totaling ~2,600 words
    - Some text blocks were 4-5 minutes long (500-650 words)
    - Text clusters: Read 500 words → Read 600 words → Read 650 words = 13 minutes continuous reading
    - Only 2 images (often skipped as "recommended")
    - Single 2-minute video at start, then mostly text
  - **V2 Solution - 20 Elements with Strategic Visual Breaks**:
    - **Broke longer text blocks in half**: 500-650 word texts → 300-400 word chunks (2-3 minutes max)
    - **Added second video at midpoint**: Element 12 of 20 provides major mental break after ticketing content
    - **Added 2 new images**: Media rights timeline, Sponsorship activation pyramid (4 images total instead of 2)
    - **Added AI Chat Widget**: Interactive Q&A at end for active engagement

    - Plus original: `week1-revenue-intro.md` (200 words, 2 min) - Unchanged
  - **Video 2 Script Created**: Sponsorship & Merchandising Overview (2 minutes)
    - Added to modules/video-scripts/week1-instructional-videos-2min.md
    - Covers brand-driven revenue streams (sponsorship + merchandising) at midpoint
    - Provides major visual break between ticketing and betting content
    - Script complete with timing (0:00-0:15 intro, 0:15-1:00 sponsorship, 1:00-1:45 merchandising, 1:45-2:00 conclusion)
  - **V2 Content Summary**:
    - **9 text blocks** (200, 300, 300, 350, 350, 400, 400, 350 words) - down from 6 blocks

    - **4 images**: More visual reinforcement (media timeline, premium seating, sponsorship pyramid, ecosystem diagram)
    - **1 AI Chat Widget**: Interactive Q&A for student questions
    - **Total time**: ~23 minutes (slight increase from 20 min, but MUCH higher engagement)
  - **Student Experience Flow**:
    - Read intro (2 min) → Watch video (2 min) → Scan list + table (2 min) → Read media part 1 (2 min) → See image (1 min) → Read media part 2 (2 min) → See callout (1 min) → Read ticketing part 1 (2 min) → See image (1 min) → Read ticketing part 2 (3 min) → **WATCH VIDEO** (2 min) ⬅️ MAJOR BREAK → Read sponsorship (3 min) → See image (1 min) → Optional details (1 min) → Read merchandising/betting (3 min) → See callout (1 min) → Read ecosystem (2 min) → See image (1 min) → Optional AI Chat
  - **V2 Improvements Over V1**:
    - ✅ No text block exceeds 3 minutes (was 4-5 minutes)
    - ✅ Second video at midpoint provides major mental refresh
    - ✅ Visual/interactive element every 2-3 elements (was every 3-5)
    - ✅ 4 images instead of 2 for consistent visual reinforcement

    - Addresses user concern: "still too text heavy"
    - No more long reading clusters (broken up with visual/video breaks)
    - Maintains same learning objectives and content depth
    - Dramatically improves engagement through strategic pacing

- 2025-10-09: Workflow Change - Embedded Markdown in Storyboards (No Separate Files)
  - **User Request**: "Rather than separate md files, can we put that text right into the storyboards? Uplimit lets me copy markdown and embed it right in easy peasy, so no reason to have separate files"
  - **Rationale**: Simplifies workflow since Uplimit accepts markdown directly via copy-paste
  - **Implementation**: Embedded all 7 text content blocks directly into uplimit-week1-storyboard.md
    - Element 1: Introduction Text (~200 words)
    - Element 5: Media Rights Part 1 (~300 words)
    - Element 7: Media Rights Part 2 (~300 words)
    - Element 9: Ticketing Part 1 (~350 words)
    - Element 11: Ticketing Part 2 (~400 words)
    - Element 13: Sponsorship (~400 words)
    - Element 16: Merchandising & Betting (~400 words)
    - Element 18: Revenue Interdependence (~350 words)
  - **Format**: Each text element now has "Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:" with complete markdown in code blocks
  - **Benefits**:
    - Single source of truth (storyboard contains all content)
    - No need to maintain separate text files
    - Easier to review full module flow in one document
    - Direct copy-paste workflow into Uplimit platform
  - **Files Modified**: modules/uplimit-week1-storyboard.md (all text elements updated with embedded content)
  - **Optional Cleanup**: Separate .md files in modules/text-content/ can now be deleted (content preserved in storyboard)

- 2025-10-14: Week 2 V3 Critical Fixes Based on Student Journey Simulation (Later Session)
  - **Student Journey Simulation Conducted**: Tested all 8 Week 2 V3 widgets with 3 learner personas
    - Sarah (Visual Learner): 88/100 - Strong engagement, frustrated at 35:00 when Widget 6 showed red bars without explanation
    - Priya (Collaborative Leader): 71/100 - Paralyzed at 58:00 by Widget 8 Phase 5's 250-word memo after 7 phases of visual interaction
    - Marcus (Analytical Thinker): 90/100 (cognitive), 70/100 (emotional) - Frustrated at 16:00 by Widget 2's opaque "market value" calculations
  - **3 Critical Fixes Implemented** (estimated impact: Sarah 88→92, Priya 71→78, Marcus 70→85 emotional):
    - **Fix #1: Widget 6 Explanatory Tooltip** (modules/week2/widgets/projections-vs-actuals-visualizer.html)
      - Added collapsible explanation section within the widget (CSS lines 217-300, HTML lines 543-562, JavaScript lines 906-928)
      - Button: "💡 Why did Rogers miss projections?" → reveals 4 critical misjudgments (cord-cutting acceleration, streaming underperformance, NHL viewership decline, COVID-19 impact)
      - Smooth max-height transition (0 → 800px), ARIA-compliant (aria-expanded, aria-hidden)
      - Discovery learning preserved: students can access explanation at moment of confusion without leaving widget
    - **Fix #2: Widget 8 Visual Decision Matrix** (modules/week2/widgets/2026-decision-simulator.html)
      - Replaced Phase 5's required 250-word textarea with interactive 5×3 star rating matrix (CSS lines 401-562, HTML lines 932-1151, JavaScript lines 1565-1709)
      - 5 criteria (Financial Return, Risk Management, Strategic Fit, Growth Potential, Competitive Position) × 3 options (Renew $325M, Split $200M, Walk Away $0)
      - Click-to-rate stars with hover preview, auto-calculated winner with smart rationale based on score margins
      - Optional 150-word commentary replaces required 250-word memo (visual-first, text-optional approach)
      - Assessment integrity maintained: students still evaluate all criteria across all options
    - **Fix #3: Widget 2 Market Value Transparency** (modules/week2/widgets/exclusivity-bidding-simulator.html)
      - Reviewed widget and confirmed it already shows detailed bid rationales explaining HOW each bidder arrived at their valuation
      - Rogers: "$450M/year - Risk-averse after losing money on 2014-2026 deal..."
      - DAZN: "$550M/year - Aggressive growth strategy. Needs NHL as anchor content..."
      - Apple TV+: "$700M/year - Strategic acquisition, not ROI-focused. Global ambitions..."
      - No additional changes needed (existing implementation already addresses Marcus's transparency concern)
  - **Pedagogical Design Patterns Applied**:
    - Progressive Disclosure: Explanation hidden until student needs it (prevents cognitive overload)
    - Visual-First Assessment: Interactive matrix replaces text-heavy memo (maintains engagement consistency)
    - Transparency by Default: Calculations shown with rationale (builds trust in analytical thinkers)
  - **Technical Implementations**:
    - Collapsible UI pattern with smooth CSS transitions and ARIA attributes
    - Interactive star rating system with state management and auto-generated recommendations
    - Color-coded score badges (low/medium/high) with semantic colors
  - **Files Modified**:
    - modules/week2/widgets/projections-vs-actuals-visualizer.html (added collapsible explanation)
    - modules/week2/widgets/2026-decision-simulator.html (replaced Phase 5 textarea with decision matrix)
  - **Expected Impact**:
    - Sarah (Visual Learner): 88/100 → ~92/100 (explanation preserves discovery learning flow)
    - Priya (Collaborative Leader): 71/100 → ~78/100 (visual matrix replaces intimidating text requirement)
    - Marcus (Analytical Thinker): Emotional experience 70/100 → ~85/100 (transparency reduces frustration)
  - **Pilot Readiness**: All 8 Week 2 V3 widgets now ready for pilot testing with improved student experience across all 3 learner personas
