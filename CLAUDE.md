    - Created comprehensive README.md with quick start, testing instructions, troubleshooting
    - Created DEPLOYMENT.md with step-by-step Vercel/Netlify deployment guides
  - **Testing & Validation**:
    - Successfully started local server at http://localhost:3000
    - Verified Express installation and serverless function routing
    - Created test sample HTML file for agent validation
    - All 6 agent handlers implemented with appropriate Claude models (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus)
    - CORS headers configured for cross-origin browser access
  - **Files Created**:
    - web/index.html (485 lines) - Main interface with full UI
