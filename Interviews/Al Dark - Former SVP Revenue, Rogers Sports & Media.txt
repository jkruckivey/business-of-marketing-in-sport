Alright, boom, that's recording.
And we're, we're gonna rock and roll. All right.
Okay, everyone, this is our next session in the ivy business of sports marketing, and it gives me great pleasure to welcome Alan Dark.
who I've actually had the privilege of knowing for many years. We worked together way back when in this fun little internet startup.
And then I kind of watched afar as he kept adding more and more and more onto his career. You know, eventually as the SVP, Revenue, Rogers Sports and Media. He's up to some really cool stuff these days.
But Al, before we sort of jump into that stuff, I always like to ask everyone a little question to warm people, what was a 10-year-old Alan Dark like?
aldarkmac.com

00:53
10-year-old Al Dark was, growing up in Windsor, Ontario.
And was addicted to hockey and golf.
spent a lot of time… both my brother and I play AAA hockey, but I have a brother who's two and a half years younger, and so my parents, for…
10, 12 years.
We're literally in different parts of the country and in the U.S. at different times, one with me, and kind of my… trying to, you know, foster my…
dreams of becoming an NHL player, and the other one with my brother doing the exact same thing. So our winters were full of travel and travel hockey, and our summers were full of golf, golf with the family.

Okay, so that's a beautiful lead-in to the next question, which is clearly with some of that love for sports early on. Like, what were some of the other drivers or influencers for you to sort of end up, you know, having a career in media, but one that, of course, for you towards the end had a huge skew into sports?
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
02:03
Yeah…
Matt, the honest truth is I kind of fell into it, right? Like, when the dream of becoming an NHL player kind of eroded around 18 or 19 years old.
you know, I figured, oh, wow, I better get my shit together, and, you know, really start focusing on school, and ended up at the University of Windsor, and then,
you know, kind of finished off my school at St. Clair College in a marketing and advertising-specific program, and then it was really… I just wanted to get out of Windsor. I wanted to, you know, do something different and… and…
My last couple of years in school, I did very, very well. And so, when I came into the media industry, I actually graduated, with honors, and was given an award that, at the time, my media director
Ann Bowden, who was one of the iconic media people in Canada, and quite frankly, a reputation around the world, was sitting behind me when I got the award and kind of put me under her wing, and that kind of kicked off my media career.
Very quickly, I discovered I was a better… I had… I was more passionate about selling media than I was about planning media. I mean, I planned media for Pepsi and Chrysler and a number of…
BC Hydro, big, you know, media spenders at the time, but I was always really engaged with the people who came in to try to sell me media packages.
And so, about two and a half years, three years into my career, I was approached by a gentleman by the name of David Mintz, who used to be the president of CAN West Global, and he offered me a job in their sales division. So, you know, it kind of kicked off there.
And, you know, behind the scenes, I always still had this very, you know, this very heavy passion for sports. Was lucky enough to work on some, on some, you know, some big sports entities.
spent some time at TSN, and then was asked to head up the sales organization at CBC,
Which was really the first… leadership role I had.
With, kind of, sports at the core.
So, it was Hockey Night in Canada being the biggest asset.
for CBC at the time, and we were also doing an Olympics and a World Cup.
And so, my team packaged and sold Sochi Olympics in 20… 10.
Matthew Diamond

I believe.

No, 2014.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
05:03
I've worked on here.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
05:04
2014. And,
And then, obviously, the time I spent on Hockey Night in Canada, and traveling across the country from coast to coast to coast.
On that iconic show with customers.
And that… that eventually, that role led me to the… to the… to the role at Rogers.
when… when Rogers…
bought the rights, so I was on the other end of the table, negotiating with the NHL, and when Rodgers won the rights.
About 2 weeks later, 3 weeks later.
Keith Pelley, who was the president of
Roger Sports and Media at the time. He phoned, and
asked me to join them, so…
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
05:52
Amazing. So, I mean, incredible, by the way, incredible, sort of, root, and experience, and threading in those different, sort of, sports themes.
So, let's maybe jump into it a little bit. Like, for a lot of the folks on here who may have never worked in media, let alone whether it was CBC, Hockey Night in Canada, Rogers, Olympics, like.
what's the day-to-day like when you are either leading those teams, or in those rooms with those clients, and you've got these incredible media rights? Like, what… take us, like, what's the day-to-day? Like, what… what… and what does success look like in these roles that you've had?
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
06:34
So my… so my role was really focused on…
You know, being in front of the team a good 6 months out. So we were always defining and trying to set strategy.
around the… upcoming season.
So there was an element of… long-term deals.
So you're in front of those customers who have a sports strategy, Who are committed to
And I'll use hockey as an example, or we could use baseball as an example. From puck drop to the… to the Stanley Cup.
Being awarded.
In baseball, the same thing. First pitch, to the World Series.
So you're working on strategy around, okay, there's a certain amount of revenue that needs to be driven, there's a number of assets and elements that we've created that we have
commercial targets against, and so you're working with the team to define key accounts, people that you want to go after, businesses that you think would make sense and fit really streamlined with the content, add value to their business, add value to your business.
And also.
could add value to the viewer from an engagement perspective. I know we're going to talk a little bit about that, but there's a lot of thought and process that goes into that. It's not…
you know, I would say 20 years ago, we were in a…
you know, kind of a sit-back, wait, people would come.
Now, I think because these rights have progressed to having such a value.
You need to have a very specific game plan going into the season.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
08:20
And fill that…
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
08:23
That strategy with all of your key partners.
Okay? So that's one element you're always on top of.
The second one is always pricing, and that's evolved over time. I remember a point in time where we used to set a value against a specific game or a day, Saturday nights, let's use that as an example, and the price was set at X, and then you may move it 2 or 3 times throughout the year.
And, you know, off you went.
Nowadays, With data, and with the analytics that we have, and with, how we manage
Ad placement within those linear feeds, both through your…
Linear television signals, which are being distributed by your cable content players, but also your digital inventory, which is a completely different load of advertisers.
Potentially.
in… in places like SportsNet+, You are always thinking about and managing that inventory much like…
the airlines do today. So, game-by-game pricing…
Supply and demand, do we have incremental inventory in this game? Not as popular, this game is very hot, pricing is very different, and so we're constantly managing those throttles.
And then you have, kind of, that third layer, which is… none of us have silver…
You know, the ability to see into the future. And so…
Sports is crazy, because you get these… these things happen…
and we just lived through it with the Blue Jays. None of us would have necessarily suggested in our strategy last year that we need to be planning World Series pricing for the Jays. Fair. We felt good that they were going to make the playoffs, but we really didn't think that they had the
the horses to kind of go all the way. And so, same with hockey two years ago, and even last year, Edmonton Oilers fighting their way to the Stanley Cup Finals. So, in those instances, you are literally dealing day-to-day
And managing your sales team, and, you know, motivating them to get on the phones, and get out to their key accounts, and, you know, you know.
work the communication lines, and we are moving inventory literally on a daily basis, because games are popping up. And in Canada.
It's a little bit different, because it really is feast or famine. You have Canadian teams that are going on in the Stanley Cup Finals is very different than if you have two American teams going. Now, the units are the same, but the value of those units, because of the engagement and the audience associated with them.
Hugely different. Same thing with… and even worse in Major League Baseball. You have the Blue Jays in the playoffs and going into the, you know, the divisional series and the Conference Series.
the value of that inventory is 10x what it would regularly be if it weren't for the Jays being in it, if it was two American teams.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
11:43
playing.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
11:44
The audiences and engagement are substantially
depleted during, you know, during those, those times. So, it's super fascinating and super interesting.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
11:57
Yeah.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
11:58
And so you're constantly throttling.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
12:01
Those three…
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
12:04
You know, kind of those three channels, because you've… the job of the team is maximizing the potential of those, of that inventory.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
12:16
Now, you mentioned a couple key words in that, obviously, the data and analytics that clearly, I'm sure, you have seen from… evolve a lot, from what you've managed over, you know, your time across these great properties. So, my question is sort of twofold. One,
you know, What do you think… is sort of…
the real important driver in those relationships between balancing, you know, the advertiser's needs, the property and the network, and then, like, in your own words, how important are sports in the Canadian media landscape today?
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
12:58
Let me take that one first.
Because the industry is changing a lot, and it continues to evolve.
You know, as we have the American streaming companies, the global streaming companies.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
13:13
coming into Canada, it really is having an effect on viewership behavior.
Right.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
13:19
Traditional broadcasters are competing with, from an entertainment perspective.
Content producers and distributors who have no limitations or regulations.
The traditional broadcasters have… Regulations against them, and in some ways are handcuffed.
Based on distribution and distribution patterns.
So… sports… Quite frankly, is it, you know, and it…
well, and I'm sure we're gonna talk a little bit about this, kind of, how it's changed
the direction of, strategy for many of the big broadcasters in Canada.
But sports is the… is the… it kind of… swims upstream against that. So…
from a… from a company like Rogers.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
14:16
Who has sports networks.
Yep.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
14:19
sports platforms.
cable platforms.
And distributes television services.
Sports was a big part of their strategy that was defined.
Many years ago.
And so…
when Rodgers got those NHL rights, it was kind of their first foray into going head-to-head with, at the time, Bell.
and CPC, who kind of held the crown jewels of sports in Canada.
And I would suggest that it's… it's changed the landscape completely.
At the time, Sportsnet was… A very distant number 3 regional sports network.
Revenues… In the, you know, like, the high 90 million mark?
Just from an ad perspective.
And… Nowadays, that number's 6x that number.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
15:31
Hmm.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
15:31
And they're the number one sports network and brand in Canada.
And… and that is all a derivative of
quite frankly, well, there's two pieces. One, the popularity of the Js in the summertime. They've had a perfect storm.
They've had the number one asset in sports in Canada.
in hockey.
And then you've seen this massive resurgence over the last several years of the Jays, and kind of…
They work very well together. One in the winter, one in the summer. They don't really compete against each other, they line up very well.
And then there's the element of, obviously.
them owning the Jays, and now… owning MLSE as well.
So… That strategy, obviously, was much larger than many people knew at the time.
But it is coming to fruition the way that they had planned, in terms of not just owning the distribution, not owning just
The rights and the broadcast rights
And their ability to integrate their brand into those assets. But now, in team ownership, as well.
beyond the Jays.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
16:52
So, you've kind of just touched on it, and I know you said you were on the other side, meaning you were on CBC, Hockey Night in Canada.
And then you got the phone call shortly after the deal was done. But from, obviously, what you saw, either side, like, that was such a monumental moment, if you will, for sports in this country. So, like, what was the… I guess it's a two-part question.
The strategy, besides, hey, we want to get into hockey, like, what was the strategy? And then, how, once you were there, let's say.
How do you, off of a $5.2 billion rights acquisition.
What's the thought process for, okay, how do we…
start to drive ROI against this huge investment we've just made.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
17:39
Yeah.
So… I wasn't there at the time, but…
understanding what the strategy was now. It… it… They had the vision of…
All of these things add value to team ownership.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
17:59
Hmm.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
18:01
You can make your money back on the marketing side. You can… we see a world where these rights are going to have a bigger value to consumers, and so the world of getting $7-ish per cable household was going to change.
So it wasn't even just about the marketing and ad revenue that they knew was going to increase in value, because entertainment was going to become so fragmented across all of these platforms. This was going to be the really true last mass medium
asset where there is… enormous engagement.
From the people that love and adore those teams, and tune in for every game.
And I think, at the time, they were…
They had this vision of, kind of.
owning the full piece of the puzzle, i.e.
It's not just about protecting our cable ecosystem, which is hugely important, and they needed something to protect that.
And Sports on Sportsnet, distributed via cable. Many of you don't know this, but in Canada, cable penetration is still in the low 70% in this country.
There was an article out this morning that in the US, it's now dipped below 50%.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
19:32
Wow.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
19:33
And a big part of that is.
Earlier on, a lot of those sports rights started to trickle to other entities, other platforms, and so the strategy here was, hey, we want to slow that erosion down, we want to protect our cable ecosystems, and sports is going to be a big part of that play.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
19:54
So, I would say check.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
19:56
Second piece was, you know, in terms of the, you know, our role in revenue was driving the pie, the larger pie for revenue for Rogers Sports and Media. And yeah, sports was a big part of that, but so was all of our other assets.
Well, when we go in to negotiate, and you know this, Matt, coming from the agency world, and you spent some time there, when I went in to negotiate my agency deals every year, and these are hundreds of million dollar commitments from these media-buying houses.
I could extract way more value from them.
Because I had two of the assets that they absolutely needed to have, and that was hockey and Blue Jays baseball.
So I leveraged those assets to get far bigger extractions of media spend within Rogersport's larger portfolio.
Check, that works. And then the third piece is, quite frankly, was, you know, the bigger play, which is the valuation and the ownership of these teams.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
20:59
And there's a larger strategy in play there that will…
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
21:03
Come to fruition over the next year to 18 months.
And people will go, okay, I kind of understand it, right?
In Toronto specifically, and, you know, Canada in general, even if you think about North America, there isn't a bigger owner of sports rights
Teams and valuations.
in North America now.
Ben Rogers.
Thank you, Adam.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
21:33
Amazing.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
21:34
Like, when you think about the MLSE deal, and acquiring Bell's… at peace.
Now owning 75% of that organization.
And what that means, and the valuation of those teams, it is that… Longer-term vision is coming together.
And they will be the biggest sports entity in North America.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
22:02
Insane.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
22:03
So…
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
22:04
you know, yes, it's very good grounding that people sort of understand now this huge empire and that MLSC acquisition, which is… which is no small thing. So…
you know, take me through, if you can, sort of on the inside, so, you know, there are all these incredible assets, as you said, you know, there's huge dollars that are being put into play. And then…
there are all of these data points now that are available, right, that we've never had before.
How are those things taken into account for, you know, the teams that you led, or inside the scoop at Rogers? How things actually today are measured and evaluated? And, you know, how important is that to the overall mix?
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
22:58
I would say it is the lifeblood of all of those businesses now.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
23:02
Hmm.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
23:02
So, I'll use an example from a marketing perspective. Like, we are constantly analyzing
and tracking every data point that we can from a broadcast perspective. So the general audiences are baseline, but when you think about
We do brand health studies for every single one of our partners on a yearly basis. We're constantly getting feedback from the market on how their markets are… or how their brands are leaving our
consumer's feeling.
And we produce those research studies for them, we leverage them, we use them when we go back to renegotiate our deals and develop our creative activations that we then sow into our productions.
It's a great example from a marketing perspective.
And I'll tell you, 10 years ago, we didn't do any of that.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
24:00
Right. Bye. Right.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
24:01
You may do one brand health study a year for your biggest partner. We're now doing multiple brand health studies and creative feedback studies.
In-market for… 90% of our sponsors Every year.
So that is a big part.
If you look at… the Jays, for instance, and the work that they did.
From a fan engagement perspective, on all of the redesign and investment that went into…
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
24:36
Yup.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
24:37
the Rogers Center.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
24:38
Yep.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
24:38
Massive amounts of feedback, data points, constantly communicating through apps and other things to make sure that, and monitor, engagement around the ballpark.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
24:54
Yeah.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
24:54
And spaces are we not taking advantage of?
How do we…
uptick ticket prices. How do we ensure that people who are coming to the ballpark are coming more often on a yearly basis? Are spending a little bit more money when they come to the ballpark by giving them the things that they want, not the things that we necessarily want to sell them?
And so, that's a big part of, I think.
not just the Toronto Blue Jays, but I think, you know, MLSC has done really well with kind of some of their engagement studies and data points that they're getting and listening to from their consumers. And so I think, you know, without those things.
The executives were constantly shooting in the dark, and now they have a much clearer picture of what their biggest and best fans…
And their light fans want, and they want to create experiences within their environments that feed all of those fans to ensure that they're as engaged as they can be.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
26:05
So I think you've helped define some of it, but I'm glad you brought up that word, which is fan engagement.
And, you know, you talked about the example, obviously, with the Jays, and, you know, and the Rogers Center, and how that whole ecosystem works, but,
How would you look at the definition of
Fan engagement, and how it has really, truly changed, and how advertisers now value that maybe in a different way than, as you said, they did 10 years ago.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
26:36
In the past, it was always just about, I'm buying an audience. I'm looking to reach a specific audience.
And there's still an element of that.
But the reality is, is they… they want…
They want to create that feedback loop.
They want to make sure that their creative is hitting home. They want to make sure that they are reaching the right audiences. They may want,
They may want to deliver a different message to a different audience. So it's buying the same media, but the placement will be different based on the platform that I'm on, because I can…
In the digital ecosystem, I can more narrowly target.
So, yeah, I'm putting that same unit, or same piece of creative, into a live game.
But it's… there might be 5 pieces of creative in SportsNet now that are delivered to different households or different devices based on the data that we know about those households or individuals.
Because the technology allows us to do that. So… and then it's this feedback loop. So it's like, okay, talk to me about how long did they… were they paying attention? Did they skip through a certain ad? Did they,
you know, did they… did they click on, or are they… do we see an uptick in traffic when we were pushing this specific offer in that linear feed? And so we are constantly managing and monitoring all of these things, both
Feedback from the consumer, but also, you know, how it's driving engagement, potentially on their platform during that live
Game and beyond.
So now we know if, for instance, you're watching Sportsnet Plus on a mobile device.
and you hit the, you know, we run an ad with a… with a URL on it.
We know if you've hit that URL within 5 days, 10 days, 20 days. And we're managing that, and we're monitoring that, and we're giving that information back to the advertiser, so that they understand how the creative works.
What they want out of it, how quickly they want that feedback.
Or that action to take place.
The industry is changing very rapidly.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
29:06
Yeah.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
29:06
Data is honestly driving so many parts.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
29:10
Yeah.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
29:11
Of that fan engagement.
Which is good and bad, because sometimes, you know, Matt, you've worked with a lot of marketers, you've been a marketer yourself, it's… sometimes you can over-tilt based on…
Feedback that you think is a blip, or a trend, or that turns out to be nothing, and there's a lot of time wasted, and…
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
29:35
Yeah, it's, it's, you know, they used to have that phrase of, analysis paralysis.
And, you know, data's great, and I'm a big fan of it, but, you know, the stuff that you and I, I think, grew up with, which is just…
strategic intent.
and really thoughtfulness around the right thing to do has to be balanced with all of the data analysis. You know, no different than what we just actually saw, ironically, in the World Series, they talk about all the data analytics, and then when you watch your pitcher, who seems to be on fire, you maybe ignore the fact that they're only supposed to throw 82 pitches tonight.
And you get the right result. So, I'm totally on board.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
30:12
What I love… what I love, Matt, if you think about… and I'll use the Jays run.
Like, the most memorable… And I, you know…
I can't talk about the research, but…
You know, if you think about how some of the biggest sponsors
Tap their arms around the playoffs as… as the… as they progressed.
The biggest and the best ones had a very specific strategy and ran creative.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
30:42
Yep.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
30:43
was completely tied to the fan and the engagement. So that, you know, I think of the home hardware ads.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
30:50
TV ads that… they were very focused, the Rogers stuff, like, they were very focused on…
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
31:00
of the Blue Jays fan, and being part of this family, and engaging with them in a different way, that I know struck the right chord with many of those folks. And that comes from
data. Like, you don't get there, you don't land there creatively without, you know, getting that feedback loop and understanding how…
those viewers, you know, want to engage with your brand. And I think it was a celebration of the Jets. It was great.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
31:29
Totally agree.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
31:30
Yeah.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
31:31
You know, one other area I want to explore before we kind of wrap things up, which is, you know.
this battle between streaming and linear, and you know, you started with a little bit of that stat to say, hey, you know, it's actually still pretty high in terms of cable penetration in Canada, the US just dipped below. But in your opinion, when you're looking out.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
31:53
Do you see a day where…
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
31:56
at some point, Canadian fans will completely migrate over to streaming platforms? Like, where do you see this headed?
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
32:05
It's… it's… it's interesting, right? Like…
My fast answer is I don't think we'll ever get to zero.
And I say that because I think that…
The technology will evolve so that Let's call it cable television.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
32:26
Yep.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
32:26
Looks very different in the future.
To me, cable will eventually look like an app on your TV.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
32:35
Hmm.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
32:36
Right?
Cable was always just a bundle.
We're gonna bring all these great assets together.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
32:42
Yeah.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
32:43
Back then, it was stations.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
32:45
Yep.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
32:46
And we're gonna bundle them in this one place, and we're gonna give you access, and we're gonna give you great penetration, and we're gonna give it to you at a really reasonable price when you think of 400 station universe.
And it's gonna be easy, because we're going to give you a device to find it. I mean, that's the hardest thing when you think about it, is as these streaming services keep popping up.
people are going to have a really tough time remembering, oh my god, where, what, what's, you know, what's that show on? I can't… because that's really what they care about, it's the content, right?
And I do think… and you're starting to see it already, right? In the US, and now it's trickled into Canada, it's all about the bundle.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
33:30
Yeah.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
33:31
You can get this platform, this platform, and this platform, and bring them together at a lower price than buying them individually.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
33:38
Yep.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
33:39
And I think that will continue.
But I also think, in the meantime, the cable industry, the TV providers.
They've not been sitting on their hands, and they've been working on new platforms and different ways of bringing those services together. And so…
I think that you will end up in a world
A with less stations, for sure, because the current model will not continue for another 10 years. I just don't think they'll be able to…
Survive in a universe where their ad revenues are gonna dip Substantially, and they will.
So there will be less local station, which isn't great for Canadians, I don't think. It's not… I mean, that's how we…
Get a lot of our news and information, and…
So I'm not a big fan of that, but I think it is… it's part of the evolution.
But I do think that there's probably a world where…
You get access to some of your streaming assets.
You get access to… live, linear TV, what's left of it?
And sports is a big part of that.

But it's distributed like it's stream… you stream it, so your access is untethered.
You can take it with you, it's in your pocket, it's on any device you want.
And so it'll be interesting, you know, does it become a world of standalone, or do we get back to this world where these… there are these services where you can get all of these services bundled.
Still streamed.
You don't need a cable into your house to get it, you don't need a box to access it.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
35:37
Yep. But I do think there is a place.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
35:40
for… a Rogers, a Bell, to have a TV service that is robust and can compete.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
35:49
Hmm.
aldarkmac.com

35:50
Because the reality is, is those… because there is no regulation in place, for the streamers.
they don't necessarily want to produce content here. It's inefficient for them.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
36:05
That's right.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
36:06
Right? They want to produce content that can be widely distributed.
And they can make as much money off of it as possible.
So, you know, I… I do think they will… we will find a…
It won't be… it won't look like it feels like today, but it will… it will… it will be a streaming service
That brings all of the best things together in one location.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
36:33
Love it. No, it's an interesting vision, for sure.

36:37
Yeah.

36:39
Well, to kind of wrap some of this up, here's what… it's too little part of a future question.
One is, if you're sitting here, and these are, like, some of our learners, students, you know, current business people, whatever.

36:56
Yep.

and they're listening to you saying, gosh, Al's had an awesome run at this thing, and he's had incredible experience, he's got great insight. I want to get into the sports media landscape. If you were to say 3 key skills that you would encourage them to really hone in on.
What would those 3 things be? And then the Part B is…
Fast forward, Al, I asked you what you were like at 10 years old. What do you think the next 10 years and 10 years out, what Al's gonna be doing?
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
37:25
Yeah.
Okay, 3 skill sets.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
37:28
Yeah.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
37:31
I would say the first one is… I'm… I meet a lot of…
Kids who reach out to me from the universities.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
37:42
Okay. And I… and I… the ones who reach out to me.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
37:46
I always… Set aside a little bit of time.
For them.
Because… To me, if they are willing to reach out and set up time for a coffee.
I love that they are taking the initiative to reach out directly to me, spend a little time explaining who they are and where they want to go.
And what they're most interested in.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
38:12
Right. That's the number one thing. You can't be afraid to ask.
Right.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
38:17
for help.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
38:18
Yep.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
38:18
And lean in to people in the industry to provide you with… because most people will take the time to sit down with you.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
38:27
Yep.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
38:28
And at least meet with you for a coffee. And if they like what they see or hear, they're gonna at least open their network up to you and try to help, kind of.
stream you along. So I have a lot of respect for kids who are willing to kind of lean in and
And put their hand up and say, hey, Mr. Dark, I'm really happy, you know, I'd love to meet you for a coffee. So, I love that. Number two is creativity.
Right? This industry is evolving so quickly, and changing so fast.
And what I love about the kids that are coming in today is they've grown up in a completely different environment. They think, like, I've got a 22-year-old and a 19-year-old sports fans, huge sports fans, and they consume media very differently, in some aspects, than I did, and in some ways, very similar to the way that I consume them.
And they're also growing up, good or bad.
In a world… in a time when…
Things like sports betting are in play, which is… we didn't even talk about that, but that's a whole different…
Level of engagement for many individuals, and has changed the face
and production of sports, both in Canada and the United States.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
39:43
Yeah. So…
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
39:44
You gotta come with ideas and creativity.
And a team… A team aspect to your approach.
Because these things don't happen individually. You gotta realize that these are massive teams of people working together to bring these things to life, and so if you don't…
I always love kids who have
Played team sports in some way, shape, or form, because they understand how that dynamic works.

I actually just had a call with someone yesterday, who said there's a new piece of research out, especially for women.
that said, Number of executives in business that have a strong correlation between team sports was off the charts.

It doesn't surprise me at all. Because at a young age, you learn a bunch of things, right? You learn how to win and lose.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
40:45
Yes.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
40:46
And losing is just as important to learn.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
40:48
That's really right.

You learn to be part of a team, and playing a part, and playing a role, and sometimes you're not always gonna be the star of the team.
And so playing a secondary or a tuition, or, you know, a role, a support role within an organization is important, and I've seen kids who just think they're going to go from A to Z in 3.2 seconds, and that's not reality.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
41:15
Yeah.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
41:15
So, you gotta bring that to the table. And then I would say the last one is…
An openness to understand that in this industry.
And I'm a great example of it, and I've got many friends who are great examples of it.
It's not always an A to B straight line.
I meet a lot of kids who are like, oh my god, you know what, I make these great TikTok videos, and I'm on Instagram, and I know I would be awesome next to Kenny Reid on Sports on Central. So, can you… can I get… can you put me in front of whomever?
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
41:54
Yeah.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
41:54
And I'm like, listen… there is a process to going from A to… That seat.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
42:03
Yeah.

Ivanka did a lot of things. Kenny did a lot of things in his career to get to that point. And so I'm always telling kids.
You gotta realize that it's not a straight line, and not always do you need to go, you know, into a creative role, into a production role, you know, into an on-air role.
Sometimes you can start in the marketing department, or in the sales division, and working with customers and clients, and still find your way to being an on-air talent.
They're actually, what I would say, an on-air talent who has a better, more rounded view of the sports business.
And the reality is, that is as important today as just being a good commentator, or a good…
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
42:52
Yep.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
42:52
On-air personality.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
42:55
excellent perspective, as always. And so, 10 years out from now, Al, is it hitting the links? Is it staying in the media world? Like, you know, it's hard to have a crystal ball, but where's Al 10 years out?

Listen, I've learned through, you know, spending a little bit of downtime.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
43:15
Yeah.
aldarkmac.com
aldarkmac.com
43:15
at… I'm not…
I need to be active, I need to be very involved in this industry. So I can see myself playing a part in some way, shape, or another.
For at least 10 years.
I'm 55 now, so…
Do I want to slow down a little bit? Absolutely. It's been, you know, pedaled to the metal for many, many, many years, but I do see myself
Playing a part, whether it's on boards, or working as a consultant, working with teams, working with marketers.
I'll always have my hand in it in some way, shape, or form, until I get to the point where my wife's like, okay.
We're not gonna be around, we're traveling too much to… you're not gonna have time for that anymore, so…
Nice. Yeah. Yeah.

Well, first and foremost, thank you so much for sharing some incredible insights, as always, and I especially like some of your key learnings at the end, and those three rules, and yeah, I couldn't agree more. Life is not really linear, and you know, I think part of the conclusion is that
The landscape in Canada, people often undervalue, to your point, just how powerful some of the big players are, and how much of an impact it drives, not just in the world of sports, but the overall economic footprint of our country.
And these businesses, and media and sport, it's a massive, massive industry, and you've been at the forefront of it for many years, so…
Thank you for sharing, and excited to keep in touch and see what Al's up to in the next 10 years.
