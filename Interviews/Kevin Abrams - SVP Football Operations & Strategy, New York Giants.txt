Alright, now we're running.
Okay, it gives me great pleasure today in our next series in the business of sports, business of sports marketing, to welcome Kevin Abrams. I've had the pleasure of knowing Kevin
From way back, when I knew he was sports-obsessed, and I was sports-obsessed, but he was kind of the guy that kept going and has had a remarkable career, which he'll tell us about in a second, but kevin, first of all, thank you so much, really appreciate it. I know you're busy, especially in season right now. But before I do sort of the intro, what I wanted to know was, take us back.
10-year-old Kevin Abrams. What was 10-year-old Kevin Abrams like?

Well, first of all, it's an honor and a pleasure to be here, so thanks so much for the invite, and it's always great to see you, Matt.
Or as I knew you back in the day, Magic Matt Diamond, official sports reporter for Camp White Pine, but,
So, 10-year-old me was quiet, sports-obsessed, like you mentioned.
I don't know, preoccupied, curious? I mean, everything I did was basically, you know.
you did the things you had to do when you were 10 years old, but when I had free time, everything I wanted to do was revolving around playing a sport, watching a sport, studying a sport, collecting things related to sports. It was just sort of, you know, like a lot of us, I mean, I think that was…
Sort of our cohort growing up is that was what we did, and it was a lot of what we participated in, it was how we interacted, it was a lot of our social fabric was just about sports.

Amazing. So… so let me ask, I know some of it, but, you know, no one else, listening in and learning does. So how does this sports-obsessed kid that I, you know, had the pleasure of growing up with and getting to know, from Canada.
Eventually, put his head down, work really hard, and get to where you have gotten to with the New York Giants and in, you know, the mecca of sports, the National Football League.

Very honestly, a lot of good fortune, and more often than not, opportunity and availability kind of met up at an intersection, and that was…
good fortune as well. Had, the good fortune of working with really good people, and having really good people in the business that I had built relationships with, and they…
not necessarily clear the path for me, but they would definitely let me know when opportunities presented, they would make sure that I got my name in the mix, they would be references for me.
So… You know, good fortune on a number of fronts, and…
You know, I had a… I was very lucky in that once I started going down the road, and I was late to pursue this, because I didn't know that it was a possibility, that once I did.
I knew what my geographic and my financial flexibility was, which was a big part of it, because this industry doesn't really have an illuminated career path, so…
You kind of have to find your way. You know, the good news is that you could talk to 100 people in sports, and they will give you 100 very different answers as to how they got to where they are. So you can get in any number of ways. That's great, and you have to be a little courageous and a little bit creative to find those ways.
But you aren't promised any certainty that once you get past this point, that the next thing will become available. For me, it tended to.
But that was just being lucky in right place, right time. But, you know, I did have to do 6, 7 internships on top of countless voluntary opportunities that I took advantage of to get to where I finally had a full-time job, so that was the uncertain part, but I did feel the whole time that as long as you did good work.
Kept pursuing things with, genuine humility, but work ethic that you were going to be rewarded eventually.
sooner's always better than later, but, you know, it did take a while, and it does take a while, but I knew that I had that flexibility, and I knew where I could go to pursue it, which for me.
I was very, very lucky that a lot of the best opportunities that came my way were also places where I had support. I could go stay with an aunt on her couch. I had high school buddies in New York when I did an internship with the league office, and I could sleep on their sofas.
Everywhere I went, there just happened to be just one little thing that worked in my favor that allowed me to pursue something that I might not have had the…
The financial means to do.

Love it. It's a great story. So, I'm gonna fast forward, you know, you are now currently SVP, Football Operations and Strategy for the New York Giants, and for those who are listening in, like.
Tell us a little bit about what that means, and what the role is, and what's kind of your day-to-day, like, the things that you're responsible for.

It really depends on the time of year. I think, as you would expect now that we're in season, everything is a 7-day cycle.
The beginning of every week is really focused on what do we need to do to give the coaches what they need for this particular week, whether it's adjusting to roster attrition from injuries in the previous game.
You know, do we want to move players around, practice squad to active roster? You know, those questions and answers tend to happen pretty quickly, Monday and Tuesday. Do we need to bring players in for workouts because we lost some?
But once we get to Wednesday, we tend to get to focusing on some long-term planning. Now we'll begin to shift second half of the season to, you know, our post-season conversations, you know.
my department in particular, we have to be ready to go, you know, the day after the season, so that doesn't mean we start doing that January, whatever, day after our last game. We have to be ready to go when we get to that point. So, we're doing a lot of study now, we…
Spend the second half of the week doing a lot of projects, so they have tools in place that will be very useful when we get to the off-season.
Every year we want to start with tools and resources for all of our decision makers that are better than what we started the last off-season with. Certainly now is very ripe with a lot of new innovations because of
you know, tech, but less tech now, and more, data, and, you know, we're all experimenting with AI tools now, and as you'd expect, and, it's become pretty quickly, or quickly it's become apparent that there are a lot of
use cases for it. We're just trying to make sure that we roll it out at the right pace, and that they're… they're truly effective, and that we're able to quality control, you know, the feedback we're getting from our AI tools, and I think we're doing a pretty good job of it. We're just… we're learning on the fly, and
But we're very encouraged by it, so that's… that's now. In the off-season, obviously, it's almost everything is team building, so it's draft prep, it's free agency prep, it's making sure that we understand what our budget's gonna be in, what our priorities are gonna be, getting the feedback from coaches, getting our scouts involved, everything that you can imagine. So that's…
Off-season is team building, in-season is week-to-week games, and year-round, whenever we find opportunities, it's making sure that projects aren't dying on the vine, and we're always making progress.

So, I have to ask the question, because you prompted it a little bit in your answer there, because, you know, I'm in meetings at Ivy here, talking about how students need to embrace AI, what it's going to mean for the future. You sort of dropped that you are using some of the tools.
To the extent that you're comfortable sharing, like, what would be an example of something that now the team is making use, or you or your teams, of AI that have made things more efficient for your team?
KAbrams iPhone 15 Pro
KAbrams iPhone 15 Pro
07:31
Well, we're hoping… I mean, right now we use it a lot for… it can… everything we've done data-wise, it can just do more efficiently. The problem is that we want data to be 100% accurate and perfect, and the takeaways to be, you know.
Sealed and bulletproof, but… you know, AI is not quite always that, and what we're learning is, you know.
it sounds very silly, but, you know, people who haven't had the exposure to using it a lot in our building, they still think, or they might think that it's a little bit the same as a Google search, and it's not. It's… the quality of the prompt is going to dictate the quality of the output you get, and
Again, it sounds very intuitive, but until you have practice, it's finding the reps for everyone in the building. And we had a very slow rollout because the league was very concerned about IP and, using, you know, the general population
versions of ChatGPT. Now we've got enterprise versions that we feel like, you know, the black box is secure, we can put in all of our questions, use all of our data and proprietary information, and feel like it's secure. So now that we're there, we can ramp up our efforts, and I think that
you know, we're trying to find out from some large industries and really big Fortune 500 companies what they're doing on the HR front with AI to help them with recruitment, pipeline development, hiring, interviewing, talent identification, because that's basically the life foot of what we do. We just do it with a very niche group of
of talent. But we're thinking… not thinking, we know that there are tools the AI will provide that will allow us to do that better.
We just…
we haven't unlocked it entirely yet. We feel like we've got the beginnings of it, but we're not… we're not all the way there yet. But, you know, it moves fast, like, compared to what we thought we had at our fingertips a week ago, a month ago, is different than what we have today. So by the time we get to the off-season, it'll look different. By the time we get to the combine, it'll look different, you know.
Is there tools that'll be there to help us in this year's free agency or draft? I don't know, but it will in short order. How quickly? I don't know.
Matthew Diamond

09:40
Fascinating. I love it. I think you shared some great insights there. I think we're all learning along the way, but we can't ignore what it can do.
I'm gonna shift gears a little bit and get into sort of some of the business side. You know, prior to this role, or at least at one point in your journey, I know you were the Assistant General Manager for the New York Giants, and as part of that, you know, I know a lot of your existence was managing salary cap, working within it.
And so, maybe tell us a little bit, because these are some, you know, business students here, you know, how does that acumen of understanding how to manage a salary cap dictate strategy for putting together a roster? I mean, I think some people think, oh, it's
Pretty easy, you know, like, you figure out how to manage players, but I know it's really complex, and I know you spent a lot of time in it. Just, you know, share some insights about how difficult I'm sure, some of those decisions get.
KAbrams iPhone 15 Pro
KAbrams iPhone 15 Pro
10:36
I think I… I mean, there's some complexity to it, but I don't know that I would characterize it necessarily as complex. I think it's… it's a simple tax code, essentially, and…
It's no more complicated than running a Excel sheet year over year, and knowing that you have a budget. You can manipulate it to some degree.
Mostly using amortization, but eventually the bill comes due, and that's about the crux of it right there. I think what is…
I don't know if challenge is the right word, but the heavy lift is getting consensus, because, you know, not everyone's operating on the same timeline. You know, coaches and GMs at times end up on the hot seat, and sometimes they're in the honeymoon period, and those are two very different worlds to be in.
Short-term versus long-term perspective.
Front offices tend to have a longer-term perspective than a coach does, who doesn't really see much further away than 7 days from now. And they shouldn't. I'd be the same way if I was in either of those seats.
So you respect everyone's…
Agendas, timelines, sense of urgency, eye on the future, and trying to build consensus relative to how we're going to allocate our, you know, sort of talent acquisition capital, which could be draft picks or salary cap dollars.
you know, that's… that's the job, and you have to do it by sharing information, you have to be explaining, you know, short and long-term ramifications of decisions, opportunity costs of making acquisitions at certain prices, and I think more than anything, when I got to the Giants in 99, compared to how we operate now.
I think way back then, we sort of treated the salary cap like it was a checking account.
And now it's more, you know, we understand that it's a portfolio. You know, it's a fund with a set amount of dry powder, to use, you know, biscal terms, and… but the whole process is very similar. You know, it's… we deal source players when we identify prospects, we…
We do due diligence, we risk adjust, we have committee meetings on investments, and we identify you know.
possible value growth through player development, and then we anticipate what the exit's gonna be. The difference being that we don't exit for profit, usually. We usually exit with, you know, what's the remaining ramifications once you say goodbye to a player, which is usually dead money, but, you know, the same thing applies, you know, so…
that's the way we look at it now, and it's understanding the value of things. And again, back when it was a checking account, you know, we were very much everyone, not just the Giants, but we were C player, want player, get player, and as long as you got the best player in the deal, you felt like you were making that okay, but…
you know, as anyone else, anyone who's invested in anything, you know, at the wrong price, nothing's a good deal. And it took a while to sort of get people to really feel that.
And, I think we're there now, and we have a good sense of what every draft pick is worth, and what a cap dollar is worth, and the opportunity cost that comes with spending them, because you can only spend them once, and…
you know, we can always get better at it, and I think, you know, hopefully we'll get to a point where we have that kind of perspective, and…
And, you know, do it better than Dallas, Philly, and Washington.

13:41
Nice.
So, you talked about how, you know, in 99 when you started, and how things have evolved, you talked about AI, you talked about, you know, sort of a checking account now to managing a portfolio, but I have to imagine that the use… at least we hear about it, Kevin, and, you know, you can tell us, the use of data and analytics in sports.
how have you seen that evolve, if it has, in your opinion? I'm sure you'll say yes, and where do you see it continuing to evolve? How much of a reliance is it, and how has it changed that, versus
Probably what someone like you, who has so much great experience, is still that gut instinct for how you see players in development and drafting and trades.
KAbrams iPhone 15 Pro
KAbrams iPhone 15 Pro
14:27
I mean, I think that the evolution has been tremendous, like every other sport and every other business.
I think when I got into the league in 99,
we were using analytics, we just didn't call it that. Every advanced scouting report, every self-scouting report was a form of analytics. It was basically trends and tendencies.
We had some analytics relative to what typically plays in the league at certain positions, you know, size, speed, metrics. All the information that we capture at the Combine, we had that information, and we knew how it correlated to outcomes and player grades once they're in the NFL, and who was… what starters look like versus backups, and what Pro Bowlers looked like versus starters, and…
You know, so you had that. They're all very sort of two-dimensional, but they were a starting point for data.
Then it became sort of a topic of conversation, and we kind of…
a lot of our league kind of stopped liking data all of a sudden because it became threatening. It became, you know, the Moneyball version of data, where it was new school versus old school, which was really unnecessary, but that's kind of how the story got told.
we didn't have a lot of data to work off of, like, new data, like baseball did.
it wasn't until, sort of, I don't know if you guys are familiar with Pro Football Focus, but it's a publicly available, set of data that we've been using for quite a while, and it was really only available to clubs for a while, then it became public-facing.
now we've got tracking data, we've got computer vision, we've got anything, you know, next-gen stats, so we've got all this data. And, you know, thankfully, we were early in trying to build out a data theme. A lot of it was just on blind faith. We felt like it's happening in other sports where data is
is everywhere. You know, it's going to happen in our sport. We didn't know why, but ownership supported us, and we built it out slowly, and really got amazing. I mean, I'm not fluent… I'm fluent in data, but I'm not a black belt, but we hired some great black belts that…

make a huge difference to everything we do. And we brought them in
With the goal of having them work with our medical team at first, because that's where we had the most data in medicine and training and performance.
And that's where they sort of cut their teeth and demonstrated value and little victories that got people wanting to work with them more. Then they worked with the pro personnel department, doing really, really simple efficiency upgrades, because that's kind of what they were able to bring to the table until the data got more…
A larger set.
Coaching was a little slower. They were always going to be the slowest adopters of data, but they're there now, and I'm very honest, there's not a department, whether it's legacy departments of coaching, playing, and scouting.
Or newer departments, you know, video and data integration performance, which has, you know, changed so much in the last 20 years.
And anything else you can think of, you know, our equipment room uses data now for… for tracking equipment in our building now that, you know, the collectibles business has become so big, but also a bit of a liability if you don't watch it, so…
They're involved in everything, and, you know, there's nothing… same thing with our dev team, you know, we don't… nothing happens in our building that isn't built on some kind of technology and filtered through some kind of data, and that's new, and it's no longer something that we have to insert into conversations.
It's in every conversation. I don't know that we even have to consciously do it, but we know that no conversation's gonna happen and be wrapped up until we've addressed the tech and data.
components.

Fascinating. So, one thing I want to just touch on is, obviously, you know, you're leading up football operations and strategy.
But, you know, everyone has a boss. You have owners. They're the owners of the team.
So, how do you balance this dynamic of, you know, the team that you run.
with, of course, really passionate owners, and sort of overall business leadership. It's a little bit of a different dynamic, I guess, than, you know, when you're working… I mean, it's obviously a president and CEO of a company, but in this case, you've got, you know, a passionate family that's owned this team, and I know that's a big part of the experience for you with the Giants.
KAbrams iPhone 15 Pro
KAbrams iPhone 15 Pro
18:31
Yeah, we're lucky in that we're… we've grown to be a $10 billion company, but we're very much, and this is from… you know, these are the words of our owners, we're a mom-and-pop shop. We just happen to be a $10 billion mom-and-pop shop.
our owners… we're lucky in that our owners are on premises every day. Not every club can say that, so we have access to them. Our ability to get to decision-making is quick.
Which is great, and we know that if we have requests for resources, you know, we know where to go, and we're typically supported. So, in our particular case, our ownership, football ops, business ops dynamic is great.
I think unlike… Or more so than years past, you know, the…
business and football side aren't quite as siloed as they used to be. There's still, you know, lines of distinction, obviously, but, you know, I'm not selling suites, and I'm not, you know, soliciting our naming rights partners, but, you know, and they're not picking our players, but…
you know, we understand that, you know, we go hand in hand. I mean, they can make more money if we're winning games, and we can win more games if we have more money to reinvest into the program.
There's an expectation of providing more and more content to our fans, and that requires our participation, and they're to set up the avenues for that content.
And, you know, we can… We're also very lucky in that we're the biggest
Game, we think, in the biggest market, in the biggest league in the world.
And that allows us access… our sponsors are pretty… heavyweight.
group of companies compared to other… even NFL clubs. I mean, you look at our corner sponsors and our title sponsors and… and the CEOs we have walking to our building and on our sidelines every weekend, you know, we… if we take advantage of it, and we don't do it enough, but we're doing it more and more, we've got a great
They don't even know they're our advisory board, but we tap into them all the time for… we already talked about AI. We're going to be building a new second building adjacent to this one for our facility, and, you know, we build buildings once every 15 years.
And hopefully we don't do another one in 15 years, but we just outgrew the last one so much because we didn't future-proof it enough, but we can reach out to Moody's or MetLife, and all these companies that have
buildings all over the world, and have people dedicated to, you know, their property management, and so they're always cutting edge in a, you know, world that's changing pretty quickly. Certainly the last 5 years, what work looks like, and what the buildings that they work in have to look like, and…
you know, well, we haven't done it in 15 years, they just did it last week. So we can reach out to them and say, you know, what ought to be… what do we need to be thinking about that we're not? What have you…
What do you now do that you didn't do 5 years ago that, you know, thankfully you get the reps that we don't? So educate us so that we don't have to, you know, course correct after we make a rather large investment into a new building.
As an example. So, you know, we're much more aligned and integrated with our business ops than we ever used to be. And I think that's not to go on too long about it, but players are coming out of the professional environment in college now, where they are brands coming from the NIL world, and we have to…
Whereas that used to be considered, -oh, the player's a little distracted, he's more concerned about his off-field than the game.
you know, the players know that they go hand in hand. Like, you know, there's upside to being…
something monetizable off the field, but they're not going to be monetizable if they don't perform on the field. So the risk of them being distracted isn't quite what we always thought it would be, but if we can get them
Into our building, build relationships with their marketing managers, introduce them to our business ops, who will introduce them to our corporate partners who want to have access to them for their programs.
You know, now all of a sudden, we're helping our players make more money, we're helping our sponsors get the access to the players that they want, we're helping our business ops make more money, and on the team-building side, if we can get our players to do fewer
you know, long drive, many-hour autograph sessions in South Jersey on their one day off a week, and let them focus on having a day off, because they can make more money off of our sponsors.
by doing…
less work for more money, that's a win for us, too. So we're trying to make it a win-win-win, but that requires a lot of working with our business ops, and we're happy to do it, and I think there's a lot of potential good that can come from it.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
22:54
Okay, you just…
answered a bunch of my questions in one, which was sort of that intertwined relationship between sponsors, players, how the world has evolved in that, and I think you gave some really, really good examples. So, you know, I know, as I said, we're in season, and it's a busy time, so I'm not going to take up too much more of your time, but, you know, if you were to sort of give
your top advice for anyone who's listening in who thinks, hey, you know what, if I am really passionate and want to make a career in professional sports, what would, sort of, 3 key
Lessons learned from you along the way that you would sort of suggest to them that would help them along their pathway?
KAbrams iPhone 15 Pro
KAbrams iPhone 15 Pro
23:38
I think, one thing I mentioned before is you're pursuing opportunities, know what your geographic and financial flexibility is, because that'll dictate what opportunities you can pursue.
especially early on, you know, say yes to everything, so that you can build your resume, get some experience. You know, every experience is a good one, but it's going to be as good as you make it as well, so approach, even if it's not exactly what you want to do, but if it's going in the right direction, you know, approach it with enthusiasm, and get the most out of it, because otherwise, you know, what's the point?
And I think as you can, I mean, there's so much information out there now, you can get, and this is… this isn't even…
sports-specific. This is whatever industry you choose to pursue. There's so much information about every company, every role, every person that you might be about to get on the phone with, or meet at a conference, or wherever you are going to have these touchpoints with people that you hope to have access to.
You know, study. Learn about it. Learn about the business, learn about the company, learn about the person.
And then when they give you 5 minutes, which they ought to, because someone gave them 5 minutes somewhere along the line, you know, you don't want to be the person that gets into the conversation and doesn't really know much about the person, the business, the role that you say you're pursuing.
And you want to be able to be as specific as you can, but no more specific than you can, about what you want to do and what your goals are. And it's going to change over time, and no one's holding you to the answer, but, you know, it…
I did it once, and I got my ass ripped for it by someone who's kind enough to give me 5 minutes, and then I made the mistake in a conversation of saying, I just want to work in sports, I'll figure it out when I get in there. And they ripped me and said, that's not good enough. You're demonstrating that you don't care enough about this phone call to have done any research before you got on this.
why am I supposed to care about the rest of this phone call? A bit harsh, but it was very accurate, and I'll never forget it.
And I try and get it a little more delicately than that now, but I would say the same thing. I mean…
you don't even have to be exactly right, but if you want to work in scouting in a front office, then say you want to work in scouting, but throw in a caveat of, but, you know, I'm really interested in the business side, I like how the two marry up, you know.
let yourself go down the road of how, you know, team building and business ops now has to be, you know, aligned, and I'm interested in both, but right now, my priority is to pursue a scouting gig. Like, that's an acceptable answer, and if it turns around a year from now that you're doing something entirely different, no one's gonna call you out on it, it's gonna be because
You know, your mind got changed by experience, and experiences that you got because you had better answers earlier on.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
26:07
Great, great, great advice.
So, where do you… if you have a crystal ball, where do you see yourself 10 years out from now?
KAbrams iPhone 15 Pro
KAbrams iPhone 15 Pro
26:19
Ugh, don't know,
You know, I mean, if someone said I'm here at the Giants doing the same role, I would be very happy with that. Probably a little disappointed that something didn't come along, whether it's upward mobility here, somewhere else in the league, or… you know, I am…
What's fun about my job is that I kind of have carte blanche to drop what's a pretty interesting business card and reach out to people in other clubs, other leagues, other industries, other countries, and, you know, bend their ear, pick their brain for best practices, and…
In doing so, you know, I've gotten really intrigued by a lot of different things, mostly in the sports industry, some of it more on the investment side. You know, obviously private equity's now got a huge role in the sports ecosystem.
you know, I live in New York, where there's a lot of private equity firms, and, you know, there's some interesting opportunities in there, but I don't know if I would say that's something that really aligns with me and what I can bring to the table, but…
You know, the multi-club stuff is interesting, you know, being able to work across multiple sports.
And really pushing the needle on being, you know, the most progressive of a club within a competition is always interesting to me. And finding creative… creative ways to create competitive advantages. That's what I like doing, and
I love where I am, I work with the best owners in the world, in my favorite sport, in a town that I've grown to love.
I don't know how you do a whole lot better than that, but, you know, don't shut the door on anything, and…
And I still have an appetite to keep learning new things and challenging myself, so if this ever became
anything less of a challenge, and something appealing and more challenging came along, I would certainly consider it.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
28:05
Yeah, it's fair. So, last question, kind of just sort of to wrap this, you know, that was kind of on Kevin Abeen's personal side, but, you know, fast-forwarding,
What do you think the business…
of football, and of course, your beloved New York Giants, what would that look like in 10 years when we check back in? I mean, you dropped already how you're embracing AI tools, how, you know, data and analytics have really taken a big presence, how players now look at themselves as entities a little bit differently. Like, where do you think things in 10 years out will evolve towards?
KAbrams iPhone 15 Pro

I don't know if this is what I think or what I hope, so we're probably somewhere in between, but I hope it's even safer than it is now, and we've made some progress in that space. I think, I think we'll see an 18-game season, I think we'll see…
Officiating will look very different in 5, 10 years. It'll be mostly tech-enabled, and, you know, and hopefully better officiated because of it. There'll be some growing pains as we…
You know, between tracking every… Inch of surface on a player, and the football's…
surface, you know, we'll be able to eliminate the need for officials to call
Legal motion, alignment, offsides, procedure, all the things that should be done by technology, delay of game.
And then they can just focus on the really subjective calls, like pass interference and holding and personal fouls. So if we can get to that point, which I think we will, I'm on a committee that we're currently trying to solve for that now, so…
It's a ways off, but, you know, it won't all happen in one time, but, you know, we'll take little bites at it over the years and introduce new technologies to officiating. It'll get better and better over time, and I'm looking forward to that.
Let's say those are probably the three things that stick out. I wouldn't be surprised if at some point…
I don't know what I… I couldn't define it, but the NFL probably have a moment in time where they're gonna have to address some kind of competition that they've never had to really address before. I'm not sure what it is.
I don't think it's a currently existing league, I'm not even sure it's another football league, but something…
We'll come along that we're gonna have to really…
defend our place at the top of the sporting ecosystem, and I think we've prepared for it. I have no concerns about it, but I think it'll…
it'll happen. Might be something pre-existing, it might be that, you know, one other thing I hope that we're gonna be is more international in 10 years, but that might be something that we…
might find some competition just in our size versus someone else's size, because if we can't get international like we want to, the NBA certainly will, hockey kind of already is, baseball is, you know, we are competing in that way. You know, F1, to the extent that it's a growing sport in North America, it's very international, so…
You know, if we can…
If we can nail international, I think it becomes a lot easier to maintain our spot, but if we don't, you know, that's gonna be areas where other leagues and other sports can gain some ground on us.

Well, first and foremost, Kevin, thank you so much. As always, I learn a ton when I listen. I think everyone along here will learn a ton as well. I love your lessons, especially some of the tough ones early on. And, you know, and just congrats. I mean, I know how…
much you love what you do, and certainly doing it at the epicenter in New York, as you said, is a pretty enviable position, especially for when I knew you, and yes, you would call me Magic Matt, and I was the sports-obsessed guy, and then you actually did it, and you've been very successful, and you've got some Super Bowl rings to boot, and I just can't thank you enough for spending the time with us today. I really appreciate it.
