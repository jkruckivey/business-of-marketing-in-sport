Alright, okay, we're recording.
Okay, boom! Alright! So, thanks, everyone. Today, it gives me great pleasure. I've got, someone I've known for a while,
great entrepreneur, and he's kind of into his new venture, which he'll tell us about in a second, but Matt Rubinoff, who's co-founder of Fairgrounds, who I've gotten to know both from some of my friends who've been there, and also my daughter, who actually had a chance to work there over the summer, had a great experience. So Matt, first off, thank you for joining us.
And, you know, just to warm us up before we get into it, I want to start with a bit more of a personal question, which is, what was the 10-year-old Matt Rubinoff like?
Matt
Matt
00:42
Whew.
I… Curious one,
depending on who you ask, probably, probably a troublemaker, in there, stirring some things up. But, yeah, curious.
Little athlete, loves sports, being outside, and yeah, not much has changed.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
01:06
That's awesome, that's great. So, you know, I'm familiar with what you're doing, but there may be some of these students or learners who maybe aren't. It's a good opportunity to introduce them, so why don't you start… tell us, like, what is Fairgrounds all about, and what inspired you to get this thing off the ground and create it?
Matt
Matt
01:27
So, Fairgrounds is a public racquet club. We have leaned into pickleball and paddle, as the main two sports that we're focusing on now, but we, you know, I wouldn't be surprised in the future, if that opened up to some other racquet sports, badminton, tennis, and other things.
But we've leaned into those two sports, in there, and we set it up as, you know, a facility in there under that public racquet club setting is to give access to anyone, really, who wanted to play in there, so…
That was kind of one of the main pieces, what we set up from the beginning, is we recognized
Out there that, you know, if you look at something like tennis, if you want to play tennis, you have an option pretty much between a public facility and a private one.
And if you look at that, the public facilities, are either not great quality, and if you find one that's, you know, of a decent caliber, you usually can't get on.
You know, you gotta wait there. You can't get a lesson, because you have to put your racket up on a board, and you don't know when you're gonna get on. And so, there's some challenges there. And then you've got the private clubs, where the list of challenges are even, you know, far greater with it, you know.
sponsorships, initiation fees, you know, huge costs. Once you're in, there's dress codes and the whole thing. That's if you can get into one of these clubs, in there. And so we recognized amongst racquet sports, like.
There is this weird window where it's, you know, kind of this all-in, or trying to test the waters, and not this opportunity where you could actually, like, book a court, figure out what time you want to go, get a lesson.
So that was something that we leaned into there around the public setting, and building out, like, a real community sort of play with it, as well. Make sure everyone could come out, meet other people, have fun, stay active. So that's kind of where the brand went from there, and and we started off, when we started off doing it, the fairgrounds.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
03:29
Amazing. And so, you know, there's this interesting kind of…
fusion, almost, between what you found, which, as you said, is this neat spot in the marketplace, in which I agree, I think there was some white space there, but also adding in a bit of lifestyle and community feel.
So, where did you sort of get the vision for how fairgrounds could exist, not just, as you said, is this maybe rack club, but something that actually has a bit of a brand and lifestyle feel to it?
Matt
Matt
03:57
I mean, that kinda came from the start. I mean, if I… if I go back right to the beginning, I can't take full credit, or any credit, for actually figuring out pickleball. That's, my co-founder, Drummond Monroe.
So, Drummond, and I had a mutual friend who put us in touch, and he came to me, I think he figured, from another project I've done called Stacked,
he kind of figured, you know, a little bit about, here's someone who understands community and animation, and also maybe that's a good place to park some pickleball courts. But he came and said, look, you know, what do you know about pickleball?
And at the time, this was 3 years ago, I said, not much, my mom plays it, she's 75, and that's about it. I said, go take another look.
And I went and started to look in the US, as it really had, like, barely any presence in Canada a few years ago.
And I looked at what was happening there, and just saw the most unique thing where it was this wide range of people playing it. You know, it wasn't the 75-year-old. Sure, they're out there and having a blast, but then there was just this whole younger crew that was out, and then the best part about it is watching, you know, the 16-year-old end up matching up with a 75-year-old and playing together on a court as a team, and I was like, this is
wild, and super unique, and doesn't necessarily happen in any other sport and setting. So when we saw that, and then also the accessibility of pickleball, I mean, I… I say the closest thing
to pickleball is something like ping pong, and more people would argue that ping pong's actually tougher. And so you have this sport where basically anyone, and I, you know, I haven't met the whole class there, I can pretty much say that I'm sure everybody in the class can come out and play
pickleball and figure it out. Well, that doesn't happen too much in things, so if you think about a corporate setting or something like that, you know, you say, oh, we're gonna go play golf today, or tennis. People, you know, half the class would say, not a chance. I'm gonna go out there and embarrass myself. But pickleball, everyone can figure it out. And then once you figure it out, and if you like it, the ceiling's really high, and so you can get in even more.
So with that, and this whole, like, Y group playing there, there was just such an opportunity. I mean, pickleball does the work.
for bringing out this just, you know, wide range of people that can come out and play. But then building out a brand around that to actually embrace it, and make sure that you build this environment where it's, you know, a great setting for this community-building opportunity, that's sort of the next piece. And so back to what I said originally with Drummond.
Drummond was co-founder of a brand called Suprette, before, which is a cannabis retail brand.
one of my favorites. I mean, I… before I knew Drummond, I said, you know, if we get cannabis approved at Stack, that's maybe the only brand I would consider putting there, because of what they had done, and what a great job in building out community.
So, between the two of us, and our appreciation, for that, and a little help from, from the brand team, you know, that was sort of the… one of the main goals of it is… is really building out this… this large… large community there. And I… I mean, right now, we're…
between…
5 locations, we've got 75,000 members of our community, that it's just built for the last couple of years, and we're opening 6 more locations in the next 3 months, so as you can guess, that number's most likely to double over the next bit.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
07:26
Wow.
I mean, I had a little sense, maybe, of some of the scale, but I actually didn't realize there were that many community members. That's incredible. So maybe I'll build on that, then. So, you've got a vision, you now have a partner, you guys complement each other, you know, you see where this is going, but, you know.
What for you, and maybe, you know, to help guide, again, some of these students in the class.
how did you go, or what was the hardest part about saying, okay, this is a trend, but now I want to take it and make it into a scalable business? I mean, you just mentioned all these locations that are opening again, and I know you, you're probably going to keep going. How… what's the hardest part about doing that, right? It's not so easy.
Matt
Matt
08:06
Yeah, so,
part of it, I mean, the first thing we wanted to do, gentlemen and I said, okay, I said, there's something interesting here. And what has happened in there, because of Stacked, Stacked was, we have a temporary
the ground lease with the city in there, and so we're activating that land, and right now, especially with a condo market that's not doing well, there's a lot of vacant land out there, but no one wants to commit to, you know, 10, 20 years of letting someone borrow that land. They're looking for some interim activation on that.
And not every day is stacked the right solution. It's, you know, more expensive than some would imagine, and there's a lot of infrastructure required. But in my mind, I was like, well, I can build out pickleball courts in my sleep compared to building another one of those in here, and we could build the brand and community part. That will just roll in behind it nicely. And so…
It's that there's something here, first thing we should do is test it.
So we went out, and I called, a developer we have a good relationship with, and said, look, I need some land. I don't need it long, just, you know, a few months will do the trick, but I need it really high exposure. I want it somewhere front and center, and they said, we just ripped down the Best Buy at Yonge and Eglington.
it's yours if you want it in there. I said, that's a great location. About, you know, 200 degree frontage on Yonge Street.
And the wild thing at that time was, people were coming up to the fence as we were building it, and they were literally looking in, and they were like, what is this? And, like, it's pickleball!
there was…
more than 50% of the people that, like, we've said that to at Pickleball said, what's that? And that was just 3 years ago, which is crazy to think how quickly this sport has sort of come onto the scene.
And so what we did with that is we built out a, a 5-quart facility, and, you know, quick, get it going.
We built a community of 7,000 people in 3 months with zero marketing, and the utilization on the courts was kind of through the roof, and people were just jumping in on this, and that was sort of the easy, you know.
the proof of concept right there for Drum, and I was… we've got something here. There's definitely something. So, next is…
scale. So, if we're gonna do this, we're gonna lean in, we're gonna have to figure out the model.
we're gonna have to figure out how we approach developers and what we're looking for. That's evolved slightly, over the last couple of years. Everything keeps evolving, we keep learning, and sort of how we approach that from land. We ended up being looked at as sort of looking for temporary activation, and we were this, you know…
animation of land, and people were offering us a couple years at a time, and at first, we were over the moon about that, but as you start to build a business, and you realize, you know, I don't really want to tear it down after 2 years, and if we want to build this thing up, what we need is term.
So we had to kind of look at things a bit differently, and probably one of the bigger things that we've done is that was an outdoor site. We've got another outdoor site at Yonge and St. Clair now to replace that and a few others, but the majority, say the next six, for instance, that I'm opening up over the next few months, all indoor.
So that's… was a big shift. Indoor, looking for term, we got rid of the seasonality, you know, now we wanted 12 months straight. We realized some pickleball players, as much as they like to be outside when the weather's perfect.
the slightest bit of wind, or things can affect. It's a wiffle ball, and it moves a lot, so that was something we learned with it, and really nailing those locations, but…
We've got sort of a good window here, and a lot of windows where some condo projects have been canceled, and there's, you know, a ton of empty retail, big box stuff, you know, you look at the Hudson Bay.
Right now, with that, and those are all sitting empty, and it's not easy to go find another Hudson Bay brand to go fill those spaces. So we're a great solution, for them, and so we've kind of jumped on that opportunity, and you know, with that comes scale, and what we're looking for is a national presence, in there, and so…
We've got a lot of GTA now. We're opening the 6 locations. Four of them, are kind of surrounding. We're also going into Kingston and Ottawa, but we're moving into Alberta and BC as well, with a couple locations. So we're going out of province now, so that's… the scale piece is happening.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
12:38
It's amazing. I mean, it's good, first of all congrats, I mean, good for you. It's, like, good to branch out and get some of that geography. So, I mean, what you've outlined now is
And listen, Matt, like, other people have tried to jump on this trend of pickleball, and people have tried to, you know, put up locations, there's one around the corner from my office now, but I feel like…
Fairgrounds is a bit more than that, that it's actually… there is a brand here that is being developed, and so, like.
for you, I guess, are you being intentional with this? And I know it's you and Drummond and maybe the rest of the team, but is it… no, no, no, like, we had a vision that it's not just about a place to play pickleball, there's gonna be a brand to this, and if so, like, how has that sort of led to some of the growth for you?
Matt
Matt
13:29
It's a big part of it, and so there are a lot of other players in this space, and they're coming more and more. What we're seeing is some franchise, operators coming up out of the U.S. in this space, and they've got a playbook, and they go buy it.
what we're recognizing is, you know, when we're looking for space, and as much as I think it, you know, we hear this from the decision makers, which are the developers and also our community that's playing, in there is, you know, our differentiator and key pieces, the brand, the community, the approach of how we're doing this, the aesthetic.
in there.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond

Matt
Matt
14:05
into a fairgrounds location. It's super colorful. It's really fun.
The other ones can be a bit sterile in there, and you know, it's… you know, it's just… this is a place to play pickleball, but not necessarily somewhere you'd want to hang out.
after, or go, you know, we've done everything. I… like, one of the best examples of, you know, where you just kind of think design.
is not maybe at its best, is, we ended up, acquiring, actually, early on, a Swedish, paddle brand, paddle rackets, brand in there. And they're just clean design, really nice, and, one of the owners put it really well with it, and just said, it's really weird, it's like every
paddle, or every racket out there, looks like it's been designed for, as an energy drink for a 14-year-old boy, and that was perfect in there. It's just… there's a miss on a lot of this stuff, and I think some of that comes from people that just don't appreciate the marketing and the community side of it, so they either
you know, they come in and they might have, club experience as, like, an operator there, which I think is a broken model. The place that I…
Play tennis at, and they're typically lost.
just over a million dollars in food and beverage last year, and that, for some reason, is totally acceptable. This is in a place with a set membership, with minimums involved, like.
it shouldn't be anywhere close to that. It should be profitable, let alone you just break even, would be a very easy one, and this has somehow become acceptable, so I think it's a bit of an archaic
model sometimes, and there's some people that come that are in kind of this rut of, this is the way it's been done, so we'll keep doing it. Well, you gotta think totally different from that. So, you know, when I explain the team at Fairgrounds, I say this isn't a bunch of racquet sports people who come in. This happens to just be
a bunch of marketing people who happen to love racquet sports and want to play it, and that's sort of what the mindset we've had, and that's the mindset as we're, like, hiring GMs and things at some of our other locations is, you know, you don't… it helps if you understand some pickleball and stuff with it, but, like.
It might even be against us if you're just too, you know, ingrained and embedded in that world, and you're stuck in that sort of way of thinking.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
16:28
Okay, so first of all, I love hearing that, and that's not just because this is a, you know, business of sports marketing course at Ivy. It's that I kind of agree with you. I've often had a thesis of everything in life
is about marketing, like, you know, and it helps declutter that sea of sameness. So, maybe the question is, as you look to then, maybe you've answered it, as you look to continue to expand, and I'm sure I know you, you're not going to stop at these additional locations, I'm sure there's a roadmap of more and more,
how much are you gonna double, triple, quadruple down on building the brand, the right investment, the right partnerships, and I think I heard from you already, getting the right people on board. I'm kind of assuming that this is not just, we're gonna fluke it, that this is a very intentional, we're gonna succeed, because we're gonna emphasize that part of our business.
Matt
Matt
17:20
Yeah, for sure. I mean, there's a big piece. I can't just write off my competition that's out there. There's a first mover piece into these markets, and, like, that's happening fast. You know, if I had been just last year, I could have been that first mover. It was crazy how many of these clubs, these independents, and some of the franchise ones that have opened up over the last year. So that first mover piece is
big.
In there, but…
Figuring out where, where we can be in what markets is something we're diving deep into the data around, you know, where's the opportunity of, you know, looking…
It's a funny one, because with pickleball, like, typically in a business, you can look for a really specific demographic, and, you know, some of the data points in there will…
Pickleball, like I said, is this, like, wide range of crew. Sometimes what's really interesting about it is
If you look at some of these places where
There isn't maybe a ton of options of what you can do.
sometimes, you know, there's sports like this that just everyone leans into. Like, we just, heard about a location in, in Alberta that had even really crossed my mind, and, you know, the courts apparently are running, like, there's over 20 courts, and they're running at over 80% utilization daily, and just…
wild numbers on there, and it's just, you know, they're… they love the sport, they're leaning into it, and this is, you know, a great thing to do. So, you know, I can look at comparables in there. I love to hear when, like, a rec room or something is performing well in a market like that in there is sort of an empire. People are looking for things to do.
In there, but we're really kind of diving into some of the data around what we can do, and then operationally, you know, I'm opening a location in Vancouver, and one, in Red Deer, Alberta.
And to do that, I don't have a team there. I have a head office team, and everyone's located in Toronto, and…
what happens is you need really good people that are on your team and talent to be out there, because we're not going to be there checking in every day, and that comes at a cost. And so, when you want to hire good talent, it comes at maybe a higher cost than we would typically see of, like, a GM or someone in Toronto.
And when I do that.
you know, I want to start bringing in layers of talent in there, and it doesn't make sense to go and spend that on one location, so what we want to do now is actually, you know, start to spread that out and make sure that I've got several BC and Alberta locations, or around that Vancouver, and then I can hire a regional manager, and so that comes with scale, is just kind of playing it out and realizing that
Part of the magic in here is, you know, making sure we're there and interacting with people.
And we can't always do that over on the West Coast, so we gotta stay on top of that. We'll be traveling out, but it's about hiring sort of a good team, but then also making sure we get some other locations to justify it.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
20:18
Yep.
So we've talked, we've talked pickleball, but I do believe, if I'm not mistaken, you can also play paddle, correct?
Matt
Matt
20:29
Yes.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
20:29
So…
Matt
Matt
20:29
battle…
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
20:30
Yeah, tell me a bit more, like, is there much differentiation, or you, like, still know, I think pickleball is the more emerging trend, but paddle still plays in? Like, how do those two intertwine?
Matt
Matt
20:40
Yeah, it's super interesting. I mean, I… what happened 3 years ago when I said everyone was walking up to the fence and saying, what's pickleball? That's exactly what's happening with paddle now. So you'll hear paddle pronounced paddle or padel.
We've realized it's the US, referencing it as Padel, and so we are just sort of sticking with Paddle, as that's the way it's pronounced internationally.
It is
a great sport. It's funny, because both were invented back in the 60s or 70s, and they're both pickleball and paddle.
But Pickleball just stayed with a teeny presence in there, and what happened with Paddle is it's been around and actually has had pretty strong presence, but it's grown significantly over, you know, the last little while, pretty strong in some of these other markets.
The best… reference I've heard with it is, pickleball is, basically, like, NASCAR.
is a strange North American phenomenon that everyone is obsessed with, but the rest of the world has no interest or clue what's happening.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
21:51
Hmm.
Matt
Matt
21:51
Meanwhile, paddle is F1.
It's been happening, it's what the rest of the world is paying attention to, and we're just figuring it out here in North America. And so, you can kind of look at it that way, too, as what you would assume through both of those sports is, you know, the… from a demographic piece, I think there's a wider range of age group playing pickleball, in there, where we don't see necessarily the older demographic joining
as much through paddle. All said, my mom has switched from pickleball, she's 80 now with it, and she's… she's switched over to, to paddle and loving it, but it's a little more physical, still very,
accessible in there. It's not as tough as tennis, it always doubles, very social, the ball stays, you know, within the court there. And so the… if you're not familiar with it, it's the one with a glass, surrounding and some cage around it. So it's like a combination of squash and tennis, where the ball always.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
22:50
That's right.
Matt
Matt
22:51
stays in play. I'm personally pretty addicted to it. I haven't stepped foot on the tennis court much since I was introduced to paddle. It is fun.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
22:59
Okay.
Matt
Matt
22:59
ads.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
23:01
Okay, that's good, it's gotta try, because, like, I've been a tennis player for, like, ever since I was a little kid. I'm dabbling with pickleball more so now, but I haven't tried paddle yet, but now you're inspiring me, I should definitely come and give it a shot. That's cool.
Matt
Matt
23:15
We will get on the court shortly, for sure.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
23:17
Okay, there we go. Okay, so I want to pivot, sort of, to just some, like, now, like, guidance advice. So, you know, if… let's say there's some folks in this class who are coming up with some business plans, maybe they're like you, that 10-year-old Matt Rubinoff really likes sports, and they're thinking of, as a business.
Not maybe pickleball or paddle, but just getting into some emerging sports.
As an entrepreneur, what advice might you give them from the business side of, hey, what's it really like to try to make a go of it in emerging sports as a business?
Matt
Matt
23:51
Yeah, there's so many of these,
Sports that have kind of been…
Coming up and getting a little bit of momentum behind them.
you know, before I answer it, I'll reference something that I always find really interesting around pickleball in there is the pro side of it versus the rec side. And so…
I'm very open, and said this to people from the start, everyone said, you know, there's all these leagues and things happening in the US, and I said, you know, those are great.
But what I don't know is if that's gonna be here in 3 to 5 years, because everyone always says, is this a flash in the pan, pickleball? Is this gonna, you know, is this gonna stay?
And I, I…
I'm very open and honest about the idea that I have no idea whether that pro stuff is gonna play, because what it needs is TV rights, and it needs sponsors, and it needs people engaged from that side.
They've actually been pulling it off and doing actually quite well, but I said, I don't know whether that has the legs or not. I want to be the first phone call when they, you know, want to start a team in Toronto, but I'll keep it kind of a watch on it from the peripheral, and like I said, I want to be that first phone call.
From a recreational side.
that's where I said this sport has incredible legs, and it's here to stay, because I've never seen this sort of level involvement from such a wide group of people playing it, and because of the high ceiling. It just… it has all the parts there. And so when you have this opportunity to have everyone engaged.
When you layer in the opportunity, then, that we have around building this community, and sort of the loneliness epidemic, and just, you know, everything there in this
Opportunity for people to come and meet each other.
it's… it's just incredible. Pickleball's doing the work, and we layer in that other piece in there. It just… it works out really well. So, to me.
there was a lot of parts there, but I saw legs in something that I saw the distance. So that would be one of the things, is, you know, picking something
And it's a guess sometimes, but, you know, whether or not this idea of a flash in the pan is… is realistic, because, if you are gonna go in on that, you better move fast and have a plan on sort of, you know, is this something you're sticking out, or you're… you're jumping in to exit?
And then, if you do believe in it, I think the idea of a proof of concept, and a few things is probably a great idea, to go and test this out. You know, whether it's free at the beginning or not, what you need is feedback and engagement with people, and you need to see
You know, how people are leaning in, to this, and the feedback they have around that sport, and to go feel it out with a number of people.
Yeah, it's, it's…
you know, these are two that have just exploded, which is wild, but it's funny to see some of the older sports coming back with it, you know. You know, you could argue squash, although I would say is doing this, you know, it's now been accepted into the Olympics, and I think that's gonna really…
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
26:54
That's right.
Matt
Matt
26:55
push it. You look at badminton, like, badminton is on a run, in here, and the courts are just filled when you look at, some of these facilities that are around, and they're doing really great in there. So, those aren't necessarily in the emerging category, but they're older sports that are being sort of, like, revitalized in there. Some of these other ones.
you just need to look at is how accessible is it? You know, what is it? Is it year-round, who's your market, and all the factors that are gonna play in, and then, you know, if it's gonna be a business and needs to make money, how?
are you gonna do that, in the end of the day? Is it through events? Is it actually gonna be the tournaments, or are you actually selling a product? You know, if it's Spike Ball or something like that in there? Like, is it the product, and are you getting into manufacturing, or are you getting into building that community and hosting the tournament side of it?
At the end of the day, you gotta make sure what you've done is, you know, the best you can is protect it to make sure that it's unique in itself, that you're building up something that, again, whether the goal is to sell it or not, that, you know, package something up that, makes sense there for someone else to wrap their head around.
Matthew Diamond
Matthew Diamond
28:05
So you've just touched on something which, you know, we haven't talked about, but obviously, you know.
The economics, or the business model.
a fairgrounds. You obviously have people that can come in and play.
You have people who can come and join, and then you also do some of these… I think you have events, and you maybe bring in some partners or sponsors, so, you don't have… I don't need you to, you know, tell everyone your secrets to your business model, but how do you look at it from ways that you're gonna generate revenue?
Matt
Matt
28:38
there's a number of different revenue streams in this, but I mean, the key piece is getting people on the courts, in there. So, one of the main,
numbers that you look at as court utilization. How often you've got the courts, how often are they being used? The difference with us is a lot of these clubs will build up a membership base and possibly cap it at that point and say, look, there's, you know.
We're looking for 300 or 800 people to come out to this club, and that's where we're going to cap it, and as long as we know we have that revenue, it just becomes an operations game at that point, and, you know, we want to profit a certain amount each year, and then we have to meet the expectations of those members.
We keep it open-ended, so that idea of the public Ragged club is anyone at any point can come out, test the sport, and decide whether they won't
become a member and, and sign into something longer term. So that's where we keep that a bit open-ended. The great part is, is we are learning every day.
Who our customer is, and, you know, who's most important to us, and who's coming back, and at the end of the day, they actually look at, they say, maybe, arguably more important than court utilization is actually, you know, what's that spend.
Per customer, who's actually coming, and how often are they coming, to visit you, if they haven't bought, sort of, an unlimited membership piece.
And so, we're diving in now into the data. It's a funny world. There is…
And, I mean, I mentioned before the word archaic. It's painful to think that, you know, just so many of these,
groups are just not providing the back end and the data that you would actually require. We're asking questions which
it blows my mind. They represent hundreds, if not thousands, of clubs in the US. We're just baffled. We're like, nobody's asking that question to you? We're the first to say, you know, like, we need to actually dive in to understand this customer at this level in here, and it's been painful, in there. We are on our third booking platform.
At this point, and we're with a group who is young and far from perfect, but, you know, they're willing to work with us, and we're kind of doing it along the way. And I mean, that comes to another funny point around a business model, is at times we said, should we just build our own?
And I'm glad we didn't, as much as I may have had the answers and solved it in there, as it probably would have drowned us, in there, is actually taking that on. But that's, you know, we had to make a decision there, whether that… there was an opportunity, for sure, but we were almost saying, should we build it to support, you know, what we need in there?
We decided not to.
But we're diving into that data, it's getting better and better, and we're learning a lot more about these customers, and so we're figuring that out through the business model. There are events, like you said, we look at sponsorships and all these other opportunities, that happen, and then the programming piece, becomes pretty key, too, that we figured out is,
everything from open play to… I mean, we do a…
singles, night that we started to test out our Cloverdale location on Friday nights, and we ended up forming a partnership with Tinder, who came, because they were like, this is wild, what's going on here, with all these, you know, people coming to meet each other, and
here through Pickleball, and so they jumped onto it. So we build out partnerships with that. We are very sort of picky around the brand, as it, because we've got to protect our brand and make sure it's, you know, there's some synergies there, and make sure it's the right fit. But that's another piece,
that comes into play, but yeah, I mean, there's a… there's a number of different ways, but really that… that getting people on court.
And having court utilization high is… is a… is an important, piece to this business.

But I do love that example of the singles night, which, it's funny, I was just mentioning this concept to someone the other day. I'm like, yeah, Fairgrounds has, like, it's a singles night. Like, this is an example of just not thinking about, you know.
the act of playing, you're thinking about who the customer is, and are there marketing opportunities, and then it led to Tinder. So, I mean, I really, really love that. So, you know, let me ask, and, you know, you, I think, obviously, you don't get into these businesses without having some vision, so…
Where do you see fairgrounds evolving to 5 years from now? Like, what's your vision for where this is going to go?

Scale is key to us, out there. We're already seeing some challenges around some of the independent operators and a few that,
That are having some difficulties in there, and maybe there's, you know, a lack of marketing expertise, maybe it's operations, but, you know, that will be some of the challenges, and so…
you know, we look at those businesses already. There's facilities that are built out that could just use a rebrand and come in and dig that. So, like, we'll continue on that. We'll keep looking at deals, we'll look for scale. We get asked all the time if we want to look at the U.S,
That's a… that's a tricky one, and I'm sure you have talked, to the class about it before with it, but, you know, there's a lot of people I've heard in my career with it who have gone and said, I'm going south from the border, and…
you know, good luck. It is a whole different world down there, and a lot of people come back with their tail between their legs. It's… the opportunity in Canada is massive at this point, and that's where we're really focused. I'm not saying no to the US, but there's no need in the near future to look there. So I think, you know, having a really strong presence, through Canada.
you know, we… we kept, from the brand standpoint, we called it Fairgrounds, and yeah, it says Public Racquet Club, and there is a line underneath, but we called it Fairgrounds for a reason. It allows us to dabble into some other things that we want to, and so…
you know, there's some projects now that we're looking at, and they're absolutely massive. You know, there's a million square feet, and we take 30,000, you know, typically, and they're saying, you know, could you guys do other things? And sure, I mean, what's to stop us in there, you know, if…
we want to do basketball courts, or golf simulators, or all these different things. I don't think that's all that far-fetched from something like that happening, but, you know, at that point, it becomes a game of, like, let's not confuse the message and the brand. We're really focused right now on racquet sports, and let's not start branching off together, but, you know, that could be…
something that happens. What's most interesting to me is, once we scale, the programming gets even more interesting, because then, actually, you're able to host tournaments, regionals, feed them into a nationals, and it gets really exciting from that front. So, I think that's probably where, where things will go, and just keep building it up.

I love it, because it's another example of, you're building something bigger than just this one-off. It's turning into a brand, and you've got a vision, and, you know, where you'll see it go, which is fascinating. So, this is now when we started out with what was, you know, 10-year-old Matt Rubinoff, like, I'd like to know if you have any thoughts.
Where do… where do you see yourself 10 years from now? What… what do you think you'll be… you'll be doing besides scaling up fairgrounds and other stuff? Any views on 10 years out, Matt Rubinoff?

I would love to be on the other side of the fence I'm looking at right now, and be on court, a little.

One more.

So, yeah, I, I look at people like my mom and that. If I'm, if I'm playing racquet sports still when I'm 80, I will be pretty happy. So, yeah, I would, I'd love to keep this, get some scale going with these, and, you know, be more, probably,
seeing it from the high. The stuff I love, you know, I get dragged in now on the operational stuff within this great experience is, you know, the strategic, sort of the bigger piece stuff, so, you know, if I can work my way into that world, and then, get a little more time on the court, I'll be happy.

Okay, well, on that note, I want to just, first of all, say congrats, amazing to see, you know, and I love Made in Canada, I love your story even that, you know what, like, we're gonna… we've got enough room in this country to grow, and I would agree. And two, I think just, you know, hearing that emphasis of
it's about the brand, and the people, and the vision, and you know, I have no doubt with what you did with… I watched the stock market, and…
remember Wes talking about it way a long time ago in my agency days, but thank you so much for the time and sharing this, and I'm sure all the students are going to benefit immensely from all that great advice.

Yeah, thanks for having me, and sounds like we gotta book something on the court soon for the paddle.
