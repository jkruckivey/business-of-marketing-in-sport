---

### v1.2.0 (2025-01-27)
**Removed redundant knowledge checks**

Eliminated mid-module knowledge checks that duplicated pre-assessment and assessment module coverage.

**Changes:**
- Removed 3 "CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING" sections from Week 2 Module 3 (Media Rights Valuation, Exclusivity & Competition, Platforms & Fan Engagement)
- Pre-assessments (Module 0) and formal assessments (Module 6/7) provide sufficient learning verification

**Rationale:** Mid-module quizzes created redundancy with existing diagnostic and summative assessments.

---

### v1.1.0 (2025-01-27)
**Consolidated Final Project Connection placement**

Restructured how final project connections appear throughout the course for cleaner pedagogical flow.

**Changes:**
- **Removed** Final Project Connection sections from all middle modules (kept only in wrap-up modules)
- Final project guidance now appears twice per week:
  - 💼 **Project Preview** at start of Module 1 (motivation: "why am I learning this?")
  - 🎯 **Final Project Connection** at end of wrap-up module (synthesis: "how do I apply this?")

**Files updated:** 35 modules had Final Project Connection removed
**Files unchanged:** 5 wrap-up modules retain Final Project Connection (one per week)

---

### v1.0.0 (2025-01-27)

**Included in this release:**
- All Week 1-5 storyboards with complete module structures
- Project Preview sections added to all Module 1 Welcome storyboards
- WLO (Week Learning Outcomes) terminology standardized across all files
