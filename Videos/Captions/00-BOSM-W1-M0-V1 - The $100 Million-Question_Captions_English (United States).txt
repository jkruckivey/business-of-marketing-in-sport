I'm Matthew Diamond and I'll be your instructor for this course.

2
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,530
I want to start this course with a problem that's kept me up at night.

3
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,070
Imagine you're the GM of an NHL team.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:24,530
You just signed Connor McDavid, the best player in hockey, to a $100 million, eight year contract.

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,250
That's $12.5 million per year.

6
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:34,670
Your CFO tracks the immediate impacts. Ticket sales jump $5 million.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,400
Jersey sales spike $3 million. That's $8 million in new revenue.

8
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,320
But your board looks at these numbers and asks the obvious question.

9
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,790
Why did we just lose $4.5 million per year on this deal?

10
00:00:51,910 --> 00:01:00,220
If you're asking that question, you're measuring the wrong things because Connor McDavid isn't worth $8 million for your organization.

11
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,060
He's worth 30 to $40 million per year.

12
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:12,550
The problem isn't the numbers. The problem is understanding how sport revenue works differently than almost any other business.

13
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:20,690
There's a revenue ecosystem at play here, interdependencies that your CFO spreadsheet will never capture.

14
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,899
Media deals that hinge on star power.

15
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:31,760
Sponsorships that activate around marquee players, betting handles that spike when the best player in the world takes the ice.

16
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,360
This week, you're going to learn how to see that ecosystem.

17
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:39,800
You'll map five major revenue streams in professional sport.

18
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:50,620
You'll understand why they're interdependent, and by the end, you'll be able to defend that $100 million contract to a skeptical board with numbers.

19
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:57,470
They can't argue it. But first, I want to know, do you already have the knowledge to solve this problem?

20
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:03,350
Can you explain where that missing 22 to $32 million comes from?

21
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,880
Right now, before you learn anything this week, test yourself.

22
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,570
Take the diagnostic exercise that follows this video.

23
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:17,930
Be honest. Reveal your knowledge gaps now so we can fill them together.

24
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,700
Let's find out what you already know and what you're about to discover.
