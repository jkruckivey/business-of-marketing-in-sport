Rogers paid $5.2 billion over 12 years for NHL Canadian rights.

3
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,320
How do media companies decide what sports content is worth?

4
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:24,170
The five factor valuation framework factor one audience size and demographics.

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,800
Larger, more valuable audiences command higher prices.

6
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:37,130
NFL regular season games averaged 17 to 19 million viewers with premium demographics males 18 to 49, a demographic with a high income.

7
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:42,380
Advertisers pay 50 to $70 per thousand viewers, double non-sports rates.

8
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:50,390
Here's a critical point. Model viewership trends, not just current numbers Rogers assumed stable NHL ratings.

9
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,530
They experienced ratings declines of 12% or more in recent seasons.

10
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,840
That's hundreds of millions in lost revenue. Factor two exclusivity and competition.

11
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:05,840
More bidders equals higher prices. Exclusive rights costs 2 to 3 times more than non-exclusive.

12
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:10,760
When Amazon, Apple and traditional networks compete for NFL rights, prices skyrocket.

13
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:18,500
NFL deal increased significantly from 2011 to 2022, driven by competitive bidding among multiple platforms.

14
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:24,050
Factor three content, volume and scheduling quality matters more than quantity.

15
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:28,820
One NFL primetime game is worth 10 to 15 midweek NHL games.

16
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:38,750
Concentrated scheduling windows NFL Sundays create predictable audience habits and higher per game value factor for brand alignment and sponsorship.

17
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,130
Sponsorship revenue can subsidize 20 to 35% of rights costs.

18
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:50,960
Strong brand alignment with sponsor categories. Automotive beer financial services creates premium sponsorship opportunities.

19
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,890
Without sponsorship integration, profitability becomes harder to achieve.

20
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:02,330
Factor five platform strategy fit. Sometimes you pay more than a property is worth because it serves strategic goals.

22
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:14,450
With reported record Prime signups during NFL broadcasts. However, strategic value must be measurable and achievable.

23
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,320
Warning strategic value justifications must be grounded in data.

24
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,349
Rogers justified overpaying with subscriber defense logic,

25
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:26,990
but couldn't prove the relationship between NHL rights and subscriber retention when subscribers left anyway, the case collapsed.

26
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:32,900
NFL deal increased significantly from 2011 to 2022, driven by competitive bidding among multiple platforms.

27
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:40,069
The five factors audience size and demographics, exclusivity and competition, content volume and scheduling, brand alignment and sponsorship.

28
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:45,140
