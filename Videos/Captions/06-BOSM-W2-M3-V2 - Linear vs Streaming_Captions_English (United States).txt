For 50 years, sports media economics were simple broadcast games on TV.

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,600
Sell ads. Make money. Then streaming arrived.

3
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:19,370
Linear TV versus streaming. Fundamentally different economics.

4
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:29,300
Let's compare them side by side. Revenue models. Linear TV advertising at 70 to 80%, plus carriage fees at 20 to 30%.

5
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,140
Cable providers distribute sports networks to subscribers.

6
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:45,770
AD rates 40 to $70 per thousand viewers for premium sports streaming subscriptions at 80 to 95%, plus optional ads at 5 to 20%.

7
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:54,200
Fans pay 10 to $30 per month, directly more predictable revenue subscribers pay monthly regardless of viewership.

8
00:00:54,650 --> 00:01:05,900
Key difference linear Monetizes audience streaming Monetizes subscribers cost structures linear TV rights fees at 60 to 70%,

9
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,130
plus production at 20 to 30%, plus low distribution costs.

10
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:22,610
Infrastructure already exists. Cable networks rights fees at 40 to 50%, plus technology at 25 to 35%, plus customer acquisition at 20 to 30%.

11
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,899
Must build platform from scratch 50 to 100 million.

12
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:32,690
Initial investment customer acquisition cost 50 to $200 per subscriber.

13
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:41,750
Front loaded costs heavy year 1 to 3 investment profitability timelines linear TV a median of price, right.

14
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,500
AD revenue plus carriage fees exceeds rights plus production.

15
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,970
Your profitable day one but assumes stable viewership.

16
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:55,580
Cord cutting risk streaming 3 to 5 years using customer lifetime value model

17
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:01,730
year 1 to 2 heavy losses building platform acquiring customers year 3 to 4.

18
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:09,710
Approaching breakeven year five plus profitability requires customer lifetime value exceeding customer acquisition cost.

19
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:13,159
Key risks linear TV cord cutting.

20
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,060
Audience fragmentation. Generational shift Canadian market.

21
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:28,820
Traditional pay-TV declined from approximately 11.2 million subscribers in 2014 to 9.7 million in 2024, about 13% decline over a decade.

22
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,780
Streaming high churn price sensitivity, competition from tech giants, technology costs,

23
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:43,280
sports specific streaming services experience higher seasonal churn driven by sports calendar variations.

24
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:51,560
Most successful strategy hybrid. Maintain linear TV cash flow while building streaming for the future.

25
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:56,450
The risk cord cutting cannibalizes faster than streaming grows.

26
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:02,780
This is what happened to Rogers lost cable subscribers before gaining enough streaming subscribers.

27
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,910
In your simulation, you'll choose linear streaming or Hybrid.
