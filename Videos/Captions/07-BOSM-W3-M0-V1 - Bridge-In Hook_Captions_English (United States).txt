I want to start week three with a problem that haunts every CMO I know.

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,610
Major brands spend hundreds of millions of dollars annually on sports sponsorships globally.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,200
For example, Nike's comprehensive sports sponsorship portfolio spans every league, athlete and major property you can think of.

4
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,760
Your CFO looks at this budget and asks, what are we getting for this investment?

5
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,560
So you show them the metrics.

6
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:36,840
Billions of social media impressions, billions of TV viewers reached high brand awareness among sports fans, and they ask the killer follow up.

7
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,180
How many shoes did that sell? Silence. Because here's the uncomfortable truth.

8
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,310
Most sponsorship ROI is fuzzy. We measure impressions, not conversions.

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,790
But something changed in 2018. Sports betting legalization created sponsors who can measure conversion.

10
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,310
FanDuel. DraftKings. Bet MGM.

11
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:03,270
When a betting operator sponsors a team, they know exactly how many people downloaded the app, placed a bet, and became customers.

12
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,530
That attribution loop changes everything about sponsorship valuation.

13
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:14,010
This week, you'll learn to think like both sides the brand trying to prove ROI and the betting operator who actually tan.

14
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,470
By the end of this week, you'll design an activation plan that answers the Cfo's question with data, not hope.
