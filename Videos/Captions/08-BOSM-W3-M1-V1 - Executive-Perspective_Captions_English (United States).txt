How do leaders decide where to invest in sports partnerships?

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:14,720
How do they measure success? A common mistake. Thinking the rights fee is the investment wrong?

3
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:19,970
For every $1 in rights fees. Brands spend 2 to $3 on activation.

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:29,300
If we pay $5 million to sponsor a team, we'll spend 10 to $15 million amplifying it through ads, hospitality, content and retail.

5
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,910
The real question isn't can we afford the rights? It's can we activate at scale?

6
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,579
We measure three layers, reach how many people saw our brand engagement?

7
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,610
Did they interact and conversion did they buy?

8
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,600
Reach is easy. Broadcast impressions. Social media views.

9
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,049
Engagement requires data partnerships. App downloads.

10
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:55,970
Website visits. Conversion is hardest. Tying sales to sponsorship exposure.

11
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,160
That's where betting partnerships excel.

12
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:05,030
When we partner with FanDuel or DraftKings, we access first party data who bet what they bet on when they convert it.

13
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,660
That attribution loop is impossible with traditional jersey sponsors.

14
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,360
Sports betting operators offer co-marketing deals where we share customer acquisition costs and conversion data.

15
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,530
It's why betting integrated sponsorships command 20 to 30% premiums.

16
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,950
Your activation plan this week needs to answer.

17
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,900
What's the reach? What's the engagement mechanism? How do we measure conversion?

18
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,930
Think like a CFO, not just a marketer.
