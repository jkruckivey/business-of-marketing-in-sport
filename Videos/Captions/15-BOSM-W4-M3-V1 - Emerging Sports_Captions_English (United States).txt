Pickleball has grown dramatically in recent years.

2
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,380
Padel is the fastest growing racket sport in Europe.

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:19,970
e-Sports viewership rivals traditional sports. How do you evaluate whether to invest in an emerging sport?

4
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:25,040
Use the four factor framework. Factor one demographic breadth.

5
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:30,350
Does it appeal to multiple age groups? Broader appeal means staying power.

6
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:35,330
Narrow demographics create growth risk if the audience doesn't expand.

7
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,920
Factor two. Accessibility. Can anyone play?

8
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,810
Low barriers to entry mean faster adoption. Factor three.

9
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,950
Media viability. Can it be broadcast or streamed?

10
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:54,320
Some sports work on traditional media. Others thrive on digital platforms.

11
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,680
Understand the broadcast economics before investing.

12
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,010
Factor four. Monetization infrastructure.

13
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:07,880
Are there leagues? Tours? Venues? You need commercial structure to create sponsorship opportunities.

14
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:14,240
Without structure, there's no revenue model. Apply this to emerging sports opportunities.

15
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:21,380
Each property has different strengths and weaknesses. Some have demographic breadth but limited infrastructure.

16
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,370
Others have strong media properties but narrow audiences.

17
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,780
The right answer depends on your timeline and risk tolerance.

18
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:36,470
Your analysts interview shows how to validate emerging sports opportunities before scaling.

19
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:43,670
