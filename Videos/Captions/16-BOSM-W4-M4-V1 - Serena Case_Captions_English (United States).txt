Serena Williams is not just an exceptional tennis player.

2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:14,900
She's a case study in how athletes transform athletic excellence into business empires.

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,870
Your analysis should focus on the strategic decisions, not just the achievements.

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,290
The case presents three strategic pivots.

5
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:32,510
First, from endorser to investor, Serena shifted from taking endorsement cash to taking equity stakes in companies.

6
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:38,810
Strategic investments in emerging companies created opportunities for significant returns.

7
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:46,610
Second, from athlete to founder, Serena Ventures now manages a portfolio of 85 plus companies.

8
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,450
She's not just investing, she's building a venture firm.

9
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:58,820
Third, from individual to platform Ezbuy Serena isn't just a clothing line, it's a platform for other women entrepreneurs.

10
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:04,910
She's leveraging her brand to amplify others, which increases her influence and deal flow.

11
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,520
The question isn't whether Serena is successful. It's whether her playbook is replicable.

12
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,140
Can other athletes follow this path? What did she have that others don't?

13
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:21,260
What did she do that others could copy? As you analyze the case, focus on timing.

14
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,550
When did she start investing? When did she launch Serena Ventures?

15
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:30,990
How did she balance business building with competing? The sequencing matters.

16
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:38,450
She builds business infrastructure while still playing, so she had momentum when she transitioned away from competitive tennis.

17
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:44,930
The eye case coach will help you map Serena's decisions to the five revenue Streams framework.

18
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:51,950
Look for the inflection points where she shifted from trading time for money to building compounding assets.
