Executives at Heritage Sports Properties face an impossible choice,

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,380
preserve tradition and watch revenues decline or innovate aggressively and risk losing your soul.

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:23,870
Imagine your CEO of a heritage institution. Your institution generates steady annual revenue, respectable but flat over several years.

4
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:30,470
Your board proposes transformation, VR experiences, AI powered tours, pop ups, and new markets.

5
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,220
The projections show you could increase annual revenue substantially.

6
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,310
But there's a catch. Your curatorial staff resigns in protest.

7
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:44,240
They call it commercialization. Longtime members cancel donors who value authenticity threatened to leave.

8
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,910
If you lose credibility, you lose donations and your position as the authoritative voice in your field.

9
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:55,670
The question isn't can we make more money? It's can we grow without losing what makes us valuable?

10
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:01,280
This is the heritage monetization dilemma. You can't just apply weeks 1 to 4 frameworks.

11
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:07,400
Revenue matters, but so does authenticity. Media strategy works, but not if it modifies your history.

12
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:11,150
This week you'll learn frameworks for balancing tradition with innovation.

13
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,680
You'll hear from executives who've made these decisions, and you'll develop your own strategic vision.

14
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:23,210
But first, could you solve this now? If I gave you this challenge, could you increase revenue while preserving credibility?

15
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,310
Take the diagnostic to find out.
