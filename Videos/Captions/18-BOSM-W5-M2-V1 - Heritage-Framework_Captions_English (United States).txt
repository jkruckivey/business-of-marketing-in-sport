Heritage properties face a unique constraint. Your authenticity is your asset.

2
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:18,830
Monetize to aggressively and you destroy the very thing people value, but refuse to evolve and you become irrelevant.

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,940
Use the heritage balance grid on one axis.

4
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:27,740
Revenue impact. How much money does this generate on the other axis?

5
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,760
Authenticity. Risk. How much does this threaten our credibility?

6
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:37,070
Plot every opportunity on this grid. High revenue, low risk.

7
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:41,480
Digital archive access. Expanded merchandise. Membership tiers.

8
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:50,930
These are obvious wins. Low revenue, high risk branded experiences that feel disconnected from mission entertainment first initiatives.

9
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:57,050
These require extreme caution. The Dangerous quadrant is high revenue, high risk.

10
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:04,910
An initiative might generate significant revenue, but if stakeholders perceive it as inconsistent with your mission, donors and members revolt.

11
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:10,520
The question isn't whether it makes money, it's whether it makes money and preserves what matters.

12
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,990
Here's the key insight. Authenticity is not binary.

13
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:22,370
You can extend reach without replacing substance. Digital access to archives serves your mission and generates revenue.

14
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,180
That's alignment. Three tests for any initiative.

15
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:33,230
First, does it serve your mission or replace it? Mission aligned programs versus mission compromising programs.

16
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:39,830
Second, would your most loyal stakeholders accept it? If core community members say that's not who we are?

17
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,040
Listen carefully. Third, is it reversible?

18
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,950
Experiments are fine. Permanent damage isn't.

19
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:51,680
The executives you'll hear from use versions of this framework, but they draw the lines in different places.

20
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,440
Watch for where they agree and where they diverge.
