This case study isn't about hockey specifically. It's about every heritage property.

2
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:15,470
Facing the same dilemma? How do you grow without becoming something you're not?

3
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,770
The case presents a real strategic tension.

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,170
The Hockey Hall of Fame generates revenue from admission, retail and hospitality.

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,290
The board wants to propose growth initiatives that could substantially increase annual revenue.

6
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,790
The staff and donors want to preserve the institution's integrity.

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,950
Both sides have legitimate arguments. Here's what makes this case hard.

8
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:46,420
The growth opportunities are real. VR experiences could attract younger audiences.

9
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:54,020
International pop ups could tap new markets. The revenue projections aren't fantasy, but the risks are also real.

10
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:59,300
Heritage institutions that over commercialize lose credibility permanently.

11
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:05,510
Once you're perceived as a theme park, you can't go back to being a serious cultural institution.

12
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,330
The curatorial staff and donors aren't being stubborn. They're protecting something valuable.

13
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,800
Your analysis should avoid two traps. Trap one.

14
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,260
Assuming growth always wins. Sometimes preservation is the strategy.

15
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,610
Trap two assuming tradition always wins.

16
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,630
Institutions that refuse all change become irrelevant.

17
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,060
Where exactly is the line between acceptable innovation and mission compromise?

18
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:42,920
That line is different for every organization. Your job is to find where it is for a heritage institution.

19
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:49,010
As you watch the executive interviews. Note how each leader defines their boundaries.

20
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:54,230
Their answers reveal different philosophies about heritage and growth.
