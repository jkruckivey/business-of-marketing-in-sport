Congratulations. You've completed five weeks of the business of sports marketing.

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,760
You now have frameworks that working professionals use to make million dollar decisions.

3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:21,530
Let's connect everything before your capstone. Week one taught you revenue, ecosystems, the five streams and how they interconnect.

4
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:28,610
Week two showed you media rights, economics, how streaming changes valuations, and the risks of long term contracts.

5
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,280
Week three covered sponsorship and betting, ROI frameworks and the attribution advantage.

6
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,850
Week four explored athlete brands and emerging sports.

7
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:45,230
The five revenue streams and evaluation frameworks. Week five added the final piece Heritage and Future trends.

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,380
Not everything should be optimized for short term revenue. Sometimes preservation creates long term value.

9
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:59,030
Your capstone project developing a strategy for an emerging sports franchise requires you to integrate all five weeks.

10
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:06,260
You're not just designing a brand, you're building a business case that considers revenue ecosystem design from week one.

11
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,270
Media rights implications from week two. Sponsorship strategy from week three.

12
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:17,960
Market positioning and athlete partnerships from week four and heritage balance and future trends from week five.

13
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,620
Your strategy needs to achieve multiple objectives.

14
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,370
It should build sustainable revenue across all five streams.

15
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:30,740
It should position your franchise competitively. It should be financially viable from day one.

16
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:36,260
This is real strategic thinking. The frameworks you've learned aren't academic exercises.

17
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,710
They're the same tools executives used to make these decisions.

18
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:45,170
Good luck with your capstone. You have everything you need. Now show us what you can build.
