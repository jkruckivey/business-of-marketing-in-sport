You're about to hear from someone who spends each day thinking about these type of revenue and business of sports decisions.

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,930
I have known Kevin Abrams since we were both sports obsessed kids growing up in Canada,

3
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,340
a shared passion that took us in different directions but kept us connected over the years.

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:22,879
Kevin's path led him through multiple internships, countless volunteer opportunities, and eventually to the New York Giants,

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:29,270
where he spent over two decades navigating the complex intersection of football operations, business strategy, and revenue management.

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:37,770
This isn't a polished presentation. It's a genuine conversation between two old friends about how the business of sports actually works.

7
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:44,460
The evolution Kevin has witnessed firsthand the challenges teams face, balancing short term wins with long term sustainability,

8
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,460
and the increasing role of data, technology, and strategic partnerships in building organizations that are competitive.

9
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:58,230
As you watch. Pay attention to how Kevin describes the interconnected nature of football operations and business operations.

10
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,710
A real world example of the revenue ecosystem you just learned about.

11
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:10,230
Okay. Uh, it gives me great pleasure today in our next series in the, uh, business of sports business of sports marketing.

12
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:16,139
Uh, to welcome Kevin Abrams. Uh, I've had the pleasure of knowing Kevin from way back when.

13
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,840
I knew he was sports obsessed, and I was sports obsessed,

14
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:25,169
but he was kind of a guy that kept going and had a remarkable career, which [INAUDIBLE] tell us about in a second.

15
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,799
But, uh, Kevin, first of all, thank you so much. Really appreciate it.

16
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,860
I know you're busy, uh, especially in season right now.

17
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,670
Um, but before I do sort of the intro, what I wanted to know was take us back ten year old Kevin Abrams.

18
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:45,139
What was ten year old Kevin Abrams like? Well, first of all, it's an honor and a pleasure to be here.

19
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:50,360
So thanks so much for the invite and it's always great to see you, Matt. Uh, or as I knew you back in the day.

20
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,459
Magic. Matt diamond. Um, official sports reporter for kids, but can't play prime.

21
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:00,170
But, um, so ten year old me was quiet.

22
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,740
Sports obsessed, like you mentioned. Um.

23
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:12,440
I don't know, preoccupied, curious. I mean, everything I did was basically, you know, you did things you had to do when you were ten years old.

24
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,260
But when I had free time, everything I wanted to do was revolving around.

25
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,800
Thanks for watching us, for studying us, for collecting things related to sports.

26
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:26,750
It was just sort of, you know, like a lot of us, I think that was sort of our cohort growing up is that was what we did.

27
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,799
And it was a lot of what we participate in. It was how we interacted.

28
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,110
It was a lot of our social fabric was just about sports. Amazing.

29
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:41,229
So. So let me ask. Um, I know some of it, but, you know, no one else, uh, listening in and learning does.

30
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,049
So how does this sports obsessed kid that I, you know,

31
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:50,750
have the pleasure of growing up with and getting to know, um, from Canada, eventually put his head down,

32
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:57,670
work really hard and get to where you have gotten to in with the New York Giants and and, you know, the Mecca of sports, the National Football League.

33
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:08,339
And very honestly a lot of good fortune. And and more often than not, opportunity and availability kind of met up at an intersection.

34
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,530
And that was good fortune as well.

35
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:18,359
And, um, the good fortune of working with really good people and having really good people in the business that I build relationships with,

36
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,980
and they not necessarily cleared a path for me, but they would definitely let me know when opportunities presented.

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,390
They would make sure that I got my name in the mix. They would be references for me.

38
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,950
Um, so, you know, good fortune on a number of fronts.

39
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:39,540
And, um, you know, I had a I was very lucky in that once I started going down the road and I was late

40
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,140
to pursue this because I didn't know that it was a possibility that once I did,

41
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:48,330
um, I knew what my geographic and my financial flexibility was, which was a big part of it,

42
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,389
because this industry doesn't really have an illuminated career path.

43
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:57,000
So, um, you kind of have to find your way. You know, the good news is that you could talk to 100 people in sports,

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,270
and they would give you 100 very different answers as to how they got to where they are.

45
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,899
Um, so you can get in any number of ways. That's great.

46
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,100
And yet you look courageous and a little bit creative to find those ways.

47
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:15,660
Um, but you are almost any certainty that once you get past this point that the next thing will become available for me,

48
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:20,009
attended to, um, but that was just being lucky and right place, right time.

49
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:25,620
But, you know, I did have to do 6 or 7 internships on top of countless voluntary opportunities

50
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,399
that I took advantage of to get to where I finally had a full time job.

51
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:37,740
So that was the uncertain part. But I did feel the whole time that as long as you did good work, um, kept pursuing things with,

52
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:43,200
um, genuine humility, but work ethic that you were going to be rewarded eventually.

53
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:51,720
Um, sooner is always better than later. But, you know, it did take a while and it does take a while, but I knew that I had that flexibility.

54
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,750
Um, and I knew where I could go to pursue it, which for me, I was very,

55
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:02,040
very lucky that a lot of the best opportunities that came my way were also places where I had support I can go stay with and on.

56
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,669
On her couch.

57
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:09,239
I had high school buddies in New York when I did an internship with the league office, and I could sleep on their sofas, um, everywhere I went.

58
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,139
There just happened to be just one little thing that worked in my favor that allowed

59
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:17,340
me to pursue something that I might not have had the the financial means to do.

60
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:22,020
Love it. It's a great story. So I'm going to fast forward.

61
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:28,350
Um, you know, you are now currently SVP Football operations and strategy for the New York Giants.

62
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,630
And for those who are listening in like.

63
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:39,500
Tell us a little bit about what that means and what the role is, and what's kind of your day to day like the things that you're responsible for.

64
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:46,800
It depends on the time of year. I think, as you would expect, now that we're in season, everything is a seven day cycle.

65
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:54,320
Um, the beginning of every week is really focused on what do we need to do to give the coaches what they need for this particular week,

66
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:59,250
whether it's adjusting to roster attrition from injuries in the previous game?

67
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:04,340
Um, you know, do we want to move players around and practice squad, active roster?

68
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,830
Those questions and answers tend to happen pretty quickly Monday and Tuesday.

69
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,710
Do we need to bring players in for workouts because we lost some?

70
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,620
Um, but once we get to Wednesday, we tend to get to focusing on some long term planning.

71
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:23,850
Um, now we'll begin to shift the second half of the season to, you know, our postseason conversations, you know.

72
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,739
My department in particular. We have to be ready to go, you know, the day after the season.

73
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,020
So that doesn't mean we start doing that January, whatever day after our last game.

74
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:37,769
We have to be ready to to go when we get to that point. So we're doing a lot of study now.

75
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,980
We it's been second half of the week doing a lot of projects.

76
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:45,270
So we have tools in place that will be very useful when we get to the off season.

77
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:53,610
Um, every year we want to start with tools and resources for all of our decision makers that are better than what we started the last off season with.

78
00:06:53,970 --> 00:07:01,950
Certainly, now is very ripe with a lot of new innovations because of, you know, tech, but less tech now and more, um, data.

79
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:05,759
And, you know, we're all experimenting with those now.

80
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:15,239
And as you would expect. And, um, it's become pretty quickly, uh, or quickly, it's become apparent that there are a lot of use cases for, um,

81
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:22,260
we're just trying to make sure that we roll it out at the right pace and that they're the truly effective and that we're able to quality control,

82
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:26,669
you know, the feedback we're getting from our AI tools. And I think we're doing a pretty good job of it.

83
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:32,129
We're just we're learning on the fly. And um, um, but we're very encouraged by it.

84
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,910
So that's, that's, that's now an off season. Obviously it's almost everything is team building.

85
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:39,030
So it's draft prep, it's free agency prep.

86
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:45,120
It's making sure that we understand what our budget is going to be in what our priorities are going to be getting the feedback from coaches,

87
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,540
getting our scouts involved, um, everything that you can imagine.

88
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:54,149
So that's off season is team building, and season is week to week games and year round.

89
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:59,100
Whenever we find opportunities, it's making sure the projects aren't dying on the vine and we're always making progress.

90
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:06,180
So I have to ask the question because you prompted it a little bit in your answer there because, you know, um,

91
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:12,419
I'm in meetings at Ivy here talking about how students need to embrace AI, what it's going to mean for the future.

92
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:18,659
You sort of dropped that. You are using some of the tools, um, to the extent that you're comfortable sharing,

93
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,670
like what would be an example of something that now the team is making use or

94
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:28,080
you or your teams of AI that have made things more efficient for your team.

95
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:32,570
Well, we're hoping and right now we use it a lot for it.

96
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:36,350
Can everything we've done data wise, we can just do more efficiently.

97
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:41,899
Um, the problem is that we want data to be 100% accurate and perfect.

98
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:47,000
And the takeaway is to be, you know, sealed and and bulletproof.

99
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,360
But, you know, AI is not quite, quite always that.

100
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,510
And what we're learning is, you know, it sounds very silly, but, you know, people who haven't had the exposure to using it a lot in our building,

101
00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:02,030
they still think, or they might think that it's a little bit the same as a Google search.

102
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,580
And it's not. It's the the quality of the product is going to dictate the quality of the output you get.

103
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:14,090
And um, again, it sounds very intuitive, but until you have practice, it's, it's finding the reps for everyone in the building.

104
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:24,680
And we had a very slow rollout because League was very concerned about IP and um, using, you know, the general population versions of ChatGPT.

105
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,809
Uh, now we've got enterprise versions that we feel like, you know, the black box is secure.

106
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:35,330
We can put in all of our questions, use all of our data and proprietary information, and feel like it's secure.

107
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:40,909
Um, so now that we're there, we can ramp up our efforts. And I think that, you know,

108
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:45,860
we're trying to find out from some large industries and really big fortune 500

109
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:50,720
companies what they're doing on the air front with AI to help them with recruitment,

110
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:58,340
pipeline development, hiring, interviewing, uh, talent identification, because that's basically the lifeblood of what we do.

111
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,370
We just do it with a very niche group of of talent.

112
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:07,940
Um, but we're thinking that, uh, thinking we know that there are tools that I will provide that allow us to do that better.

113
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:15,920
Um, we just we have unlocked it entirely, and we feel like we've got the beginnings of it, but we're not we're not all the way there yet.

114
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:24,319
But, you know, it moves fast, like, compared to what we thought we had at our fingertips a week ago, a month ago is different than what we have today.

115
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,610
So by the time we get to the off season, it'll look different by the time we get to the combine and look different,

116
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:32,040
you know, is there tools that'll be there to help us in this year's free?

117
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:36,050
And so your draft I don't know. But it will in in short order.

118
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,710
How quickly I don't know. Fascinating, I love it.

119
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:46,950
I think, uh, you, uh, share some great insights there. I think we're all learning along the way, but, um, we can't ignore what it can do.

120
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:52,020
Um, I'm going to shift gears a little bit and get into sort of some of the business side.

121
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:59,340
Um, you know, prior to this role, um, or at least at one point in your journey, I know you were the assistant general manager for the New York Giants.

122
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:06,150
And as part of that, you know, I know a lot of your existence was managing the salary cap, working within it.

123
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:10,650
And so maybe tell us a little bit, because these are some, you know, business students here.

124
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:20,940
Um, you know, how does that acumen of understanding how to manage a salary cap dictate strategy for putting together a roster?

125
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,560
I mean, I think some people think, oh, it's pretty easy, you know, like you figure out how to manage players.

126
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,000
But I know it's really complex.

127
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,640
And I know you spent a lot of time in it just, you know, share some insights about how difficult I'm sure some of those decisions get.

128
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:40,040
And. I mean, there's some complexity to it, but I don't know that I would characterize it necessarily as complex.

129
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,350
I think it's it's a simple tax code, essentially.

130
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:51,290
And, um, it's no more complicated than running an Excel sheet year over year and knowing that you have a budget,

131
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:56,430
it's you can manipulate it to some degree. Um, mostly using amortization.

132
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:00,480
Um, but eventually the bill comes do. And that's about the crux of it right there.

133
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:05,579
I think what is, um, of challenge challenges the right word.

134
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:11,700
But the, the heavy lift is getting consensus because you're not everyone's operating on the same timeline.

135
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:16,200
You know, coaches and gyms at times end up on the hot seat, and sometimes they're in the honeymoon period.

136
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,850
And those are two very different worlds to be in. Um, short term versus long term perspective.

137
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:28,350
Um, front offices tend to have a long term perspective than a coach does, who doesn't really see much further away than seven days from now.

138
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:31,770
But anyway, shouldn't I be the same way if I was in either of those seats?

139
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:36,620
So you respect everyone's. Agendas, timelines.

140
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:43,430
Um. Sense of urgency. Eye on the future and trying to build consensus relative to how we're going to allocate our,

141
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:48,200
you know, sort of talent acquisition capital, which could be draft picks or salary cap dollars.

142
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:54,890
You know, that's that's the job. And you have to do it by sharing information and yet be explaining, you know,

143
00:12:54,890 --> 00:13:00,440
short and long term ramifications of decisions on opportunity, cost of making acquisitions at certain prices.

144
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,960
And I think more than anything, when I got to the Giants in 99, compared to how we operate now,

145
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,460
I think way back then we sort of treated the salary cap like it was a checking account,

146
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,090
and now it's more, you know, we understand that it's a portfolio.

147
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:21,560
You know, it's a it's a fund with a set amount of dry powder to use, you know, fiscal terms and um, and, but the whole process is very similar.

148
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,919
You know, it's we deal sauce players.

149
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,579
When we identify prospects, we do due diligence.

150
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:35,570
We risk adjust. We have committee meetings on investments and we identify, you know.

151
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,900
Possible value growth through player development.

152
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,610
And then we anticipate with the eggs, it's going to be the difference being that we don't exit for profit usually.

153
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,599
We usually exit with, you know, what's the remaining ramifications.

154
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,079
Want to say goodbye to a player, which you usually don't Bunny.

155
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,340
But you know, the same thing applies, you know. So that's the way we look at it now.

156
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:01,969
And it's understanding the value of things. And again, back when it was a checking account, you know, we were very much everyone,

157
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,820
not just the Giants, but we were a key player, one player, a good player.

158
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:08,870
And as long as you got the best player in the deal, you felt like you're making it okay.

159
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:13,040
But you know, does anyone else, anyone is invested in anything you know, at the wrong price.

160
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,390
Nothing is a good deal. And took a while to sort of get people to really feel that.

161
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:22,940
And, um, I think we're there now and we have a good sense of what every draft pick is worth and

162
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,389
what a cap dollar's worth and the opportunity cost that comes with spending them,

163
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:30,469
because you can only spend them once. And, you know, we can always get better at it.

164
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:35,180
And I think, you know, hopefully we'll get to a point where we have that kind of perspective and,

165
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:39,380
and, um, you know, do it better than Dallas, Philly in Washington.

166
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:47,600
Nice. Um, so you talked about how, you know, in 99 when you started and how things have evolved.

167
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:53,990
Um, you talked about AI, you talked about, you know, sort of a checking account out and managing a portfolio.

168
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,740
But I have to imagine that they use at least we hear about it, Kevin.

169
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:02,240
And, you know, you can tell us the use of data and analytics in sports.

170
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:07,580
How have you seen that evolve? If it has in your opinion, I'm sure you'll say yes.

171
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,820
And where do you see it continuing to evolve?

172
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:15,740
How much of a reliance is it and how has it changed that versus probably what someone like you,

173
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:24,200
who has so much great experience, is still that gut instinct for how you see players in development and drafting and trades.

174
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:30,190
I think that the evolution has been tremendous. Um, like every other sport and every other business.

175
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,440
I think when I got into the league in 99, we were using analytics.

176
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,110
We just didn't call it that. Every advanced scouting report, every self scouting report was a form of analytics.

177
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,090
It was basically trends and tendencies.

178
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:50,830
Um, we had some analytics relative to what typically plays in the league in certain positions, you know, size, feed metrics.

179
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,739
Um, all the information that we catch here at the combine,

180
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:58,840
we had that information and we knew how it correlated to outcomes and player grades once they're in the NFL.

181
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,669
And who was what starters look like versus backups from a Pro Bowlers look like versus starters.

182
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,850
And you know so you had that overall very sort of two dimensional.

183
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:13,329
But they were a starting point for data. Then it became sort of a topic of conversation.

184
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:19,000
And we we kind of a lot of our league kind of stopped liking data all of a sudden because it became threatening.

185
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,030
It became, you know, the Moneyball version of data, where it was new school versus old school, which was really unnecessary.

186
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:31,210
But that's kind of how the story got told. We didn't have a lot of data to work off of, like new data, like baseball did.

187
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:36,430
Um, it wasn't until sort of I don't think I just noted Pro Football Focus,

188
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:42,130
but it's a publicly available, um, set of data that we've been using for quite a while.

189
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:46,210
Um, and it was really only available to clubs for a while, and then it became public facing.

190
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:52,689
Now we've got tracking data, we've got computer vision, we've got anything, you know, next gen stats.

191
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:58,360
So we've got all this data. And, you know, thankfully we were early in trying to build out a data team.

192
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:05,440
Um, a lot of it was just on blind faith. We felt like it's happening in other sports for data is, um, is everywhere.

193
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:13,149
You know, it's going to happen in our sport. We didn't know why, but ownership supported us and we built it out slowly and really got amazing.

194
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:16,540
I mean, I'm not fluent, I'm fluent in data, but I'm not a black belt.

195
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:21,850
But we hired some great black belts that, um, make a huge difference to everything we do.

196
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:27,190
And we brought them in with the goal of having them work with our medical team at first,

197
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:31,690
because that's where we had the most data in medicine and and training and performance,

198
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,089
and that's where they sort of cut their teeth and demonstrated value in little victories that

199
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:41,200
got people wanting to work with them more than they worked with the pro personnel department,

200
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:48,460
doing really, really simple efficiency upgrades, because that's kind of what they're able to bring to the table until the data got more,

201
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:53,500
um, a larger set, um, coaching was a little slower.

202
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:57,639
They were always going to be the slowest adopters of data, but they're there now.

203
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:05,590
And I'm very honest. There's not a department, whether it's legacy departments of of coaching, playing in in scouting or newer departments,

204
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:11,470
you know, video and data integration performance, which is, you know, changed so much in the last 20 years.

205
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:18,100
Um, and anything else you can think of in your equipment room uses data now for, for tracking equipment in our building.

206
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:23,860
Now that you know, the the collectibles business would become so big, but also a bit of a liability if you don't watch it.

207
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:28,360
So they're involved in everything and you know, there's nothing same thing with our dev team.

208
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:35,290
You know we don't nothing happens in our building that isn't built on some kind of technology and filtered through some kind of data, and that's new.

209
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:38,890
And it's no longer something that we have to insert into conversations.

210
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,780
Um, it's in every conversation. I don't know that we even have to consciously do it,

211
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:50,500
but we know that no conversation is going to happen and be wrapped up until we've addressed the tech and data components.

212
00:18:51,160 --> 00:19:00,460
Um, fascinating. So one thing I want to just touch on is obviously, you know, um, you're leading up football operations and strategy,

213
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:06,160
but, you know, everyone has a boss, um, you have owners, the owners of the team.

214
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,650
So how do you balance this dynamic of, you know, the team that you run with,

215
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:17,410
of course, really passionate owners and sort of overall business leadership.

216
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:22,270
It's a little bit of a different dynamic, I guess. Then, you know, when you're working, I mean, there's obviously a president CEO of a company,

217
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:25,390
but in this case you've got, you know, passionate family that's on this team.

218
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:29,420
And I know it's a big part of the experience for you with the Giants. You were.

219
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:34,049
We're lucky in that we're. We've grown to be a $10 billion company, but we're very much.

220
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:38,840
And this is from you know, these are the words of our owners were a mom and pop shop.

221
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:46,620
We just have a $10 billion mom and pop shop. Um, our owners were lucky in that our owners are on premises every day.

222
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:55,830
Not every club can say that. So we have access to them where our ability to get to decision making is quick, um, which is great.

223
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,870
And we know that if we have requests for resources, you know, we know where to go.

224
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:09,390
And we're typically supported. So in our particular case, um, our ownership football ops business ops dynamic is, is great.

225
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:18,089
Um, I think unlike um or more so than in years past, you know, the business and football side aren't quite as siloed as they used to be.

226
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:21,780
There's still, you know, lines of distinction, obviously, but, you know,

227
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:25,709
I'm not selling sweets and I'm not, you know, soliciting or naming rights partners.

228
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:31,410
But, you know, and they're not picking our players. But, you know, we understand that, you know, we go hand in hand.

229
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:37,500
I mean, they can make more money if we're winning games and we can win more games if we have more money and reinvest into the program.

230
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:42,930
Um, there's an expectation of providing more and more content to our fans,

231
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:47,070
and that requires our participation and their to set up the avenues for that content.

232
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:57,840
And, you know, we can we're we're also very lucky in that we're the biggest game, we think in the biggest market in the biggest league in the world.

233
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,870
Um, and that allows us access. Our sponsors are pretty heavyweight.

234
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:08,520
Group of companies compared to other even NFL clubs.

235
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:15,440
I mean, you look at our corner sponsors and our title sponsors and and the CEOs, we are walking to our building and on our sidelines every weekend.

236
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:20,330
You know, we if we take advantage of it and we we don't do it enough, but we're doing it more and more.

237
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:26,600
We've got a great don't even know there are advisory board, but we tap into them all the time for we already talked about AI.

238
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:31,639
We're going to be building a new second building adjacent to this one for our facility.

239
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,670
And, you know, we build buildings once every 15 years.

240
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:41,570
Um, and hopefully we don't do another 1 in 15 years, but we just outgrew the last one so much because we didn't futureproof it enough.

241
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:50,750
But we can reach out to Moody's or MetLife and all these companies that have buildings all over the world and have people dedicated to,

242
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:56,239
you know, their property management. And so they're always cutting edge in a, you know, world is changing pretty quickly.

243
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,700
Certainly the last five years, what work looks like and what the buildings that they work in have to look like.

244
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,480
And you well, we haven't done it in 15 years. They just did it last week.

245
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:08,660
So we can reach out to them and say, you know what ought to be, what are we?

246
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:14,419
What do we need to be thinking about that we're not what have you what do you now do that you didn't do five years ago that,

247
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:20,659
you know, thankfully you get the reps that we don't. So to educate us so that we don't have to, you know, course.

248
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:25,610
Correct. After we make a rather large investment into a new building as an example.

249
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:30,530
So, you know, we were much more aligned and integrated with our business ops than we ever used to be.

250
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,810
And I think that's not to go on too long about it.

251
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:38,480
But players are coming out of a professional environment in college now where they are brands coming from the NFL world,

252
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,880
and we have to, whereas that used to be considered, uh, players a little distracted.

253
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:48,350
He's more concerned about his off field than the game. You know, the players know that they go hand in hand.

254
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,420
Like you know there's upside to being.

255
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:56,290
Something monetizable off the field, but they're not going to be monetizable if they don't perform on the field.

256
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:59,640
So the risk of them being distracted isn't quite what we always thought it would be.

257
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:07,290
But if we can get them. Into our building, build relationships with their marketing managers, introduce them to our business ops,

258
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:12,330
who will introduce them to our corporate partners who want to have access to them for their programs.

259
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:17,930
You know, no sudden we're helping our players make more money. We're helping our sponsors get the access to the players they want.

260
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:26,190
We're helping our business make more money. And on the team building side, if we can get our players to do fewer, you know, long drive,

261
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:30,839
many our autograph sessions in South Jersey on their one day off a week and let them

262
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:37,290
focus on having a day off because they can make more money off of our sponsors by doing.

263
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,570
Less work for more money. That's a win for us too.

264
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:47,739
So we're trying to make it a win win win. But that requires a lot of working with our business ops and we're happy to do it.

265
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:50,950
And I think there's a lot of potential good that can come from it.

266
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,509
Okay, you just answered a bunch of my questions in one,

267
00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:02,559
which was sort of that intertwined relationship between sponsors, players, how the world has evolved in that.

268
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:10,870
And I think you gave some really, really good examples. So, um, you know, I know, uh, as I said, we're we're in season and it's a busy time.

269
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,429
So I'm not going to take up too much more of your time.

270
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:20,130
But, you know, if you were to sort of give your top advice for anyone who's listening in who thinks, hey, you know what?

271
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:25,420
If I am really passionate and want to make a career in professional sports,

272
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:34,510
what would sort of three key lessons learned from you along the way that you would sort of suggest to them that would help them along their pathway?

273
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:39,509
I think, uh, one thing I mentioned before is you're pursuing opportunities.

274
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:45,390
Know what your geographic and financial flexibility is, because that'll dictate what opportunities you can pursue to,

275
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:52,770
um, especially early on, you know, say yes to everything so that you can build your resume, get some experience.

276
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,940
You know, every experience is a good one, but it's going to be as good as you make it as well.

277
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,960
So approach, even if it's not exactly what you want to do, but if it's going in the right direction,

278
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:04,620
you know, approach it with enthusiasm and get the most out of it.

279
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,480
Because otherwise, you know, what's the point?

280
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:14,729
Um, and I think, as you can see, there's so much information out there now you can get and this is this isn't even sports specific.

281
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:19,559
This is whatever industry you choose to pursue. There's so much information about every company, every role,

282
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,760
every person that you might be about to get on the phone with or meet at a conference or

283
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,770
wherever you are going to have these touchpoints with people that you hope to have access to,

284
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:33,720
you know, study, learn about it, learn about the business, learn about the company, learn about the person.

285
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:40,919
And then when they give you five minutes, um, which they ought to because someone gave them five minutes somewhere along the line, you know,

286
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,760
you don't want to be the person that gets in the conversation doesn't really know much about the person,

287
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,950
the business, the role that you say you're pursuing.

288
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:54,360
And you want to be able to be as specific as you can, but no more specific than you can about what you want to do and what your goals are.

289
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,030
And it's going to change over time, and no one's holding you to the answer.

290
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:03,929
But you know, I it I did it once and I and I got my ass ripped for it by someone who's kind enough to give me five minutes.

291
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:07,169
And and I made the mistake in a conversation of saying, I just want to work in sports.

292
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:11,270
I'll figure it out when I get in there. And they they ripped me and said, that's not good enough.

293
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:16,440
You you're demonstrating that you don't care enough about this phone call to have done any research before you got on this.

294
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:21,930
Why am I supposed to care about the rest of this phone call? A bit harsh, but it was very accurate and I'll never forget it.

295
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,670
And I try and get a little more delicately than that now. But I would say the same thing.

296
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:30,329
I mean, you don't even have to be exactly right.

297
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:34,860
But if you want to work in scouting in a front office, then say you want to work in scouting.

298
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:40,500
But throw in a caveat. Uh, but, you know, I'm really interested in the business side of, like, on the to marry, uh, you know.

299
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:47,070
Let yourself go down the road of how you know, teambuilding in business office now has to be, you know, aligned.

300
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:51,059
And I'm interested in both. But right now my my priority is to pursue a scouting gig.

301
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,799
Like that's an acceptable answer.

302
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,910
And if it turns around a year from now that you're doing something entirely different, no one's going to call you out on it.

303
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:04,170
It's going to because, you know, your mind got changed by experience and experiences that you got because you had better answers earlier on.

304
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:12,500
Great, great, great advice. Um. So where do you if you have a crystal ball?

305
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:15,950
Um, where do you see yourself ten years up from now?

306
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:27,020
Uh, I don't know. Um. You know, I mean, if someone said, I'm here, the Giants doing the same role, I would be very happy with that.

307
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:30,260
Probably a little disappointed that something didn't come along.

308
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:37,480
Whether it's upward mobility here, somewhere else in the league or, you know, I am the good.

309
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:41,090
What's fun about my job is that I kind of have carte blanche to drop what's a

310
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:44,870
pretty interesting business card and reach out to people and and the clubs,

311
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:50,809
other leagues, other industries, other countries, and, you know, bend their ear, pick their brain for best practices.

312
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:57,290
And in doing so, you know, I've gotten really intrigued by a lot of different things, mostly in the sports industry.

313
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:03,650
So a bit more on the investment side. You know, obviously private equity has now got a huge role in the sports ecosystem.

314
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,160
You know, I live in New York where there's a lot of private equity firms.

315
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,219
And, you know, there's some interesting opportunities in there.

316
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:14,780
But I don't know if I would say that something that really aligns with me and what I can bring to the table.

317
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,990
But, you know, the multi club stuff is interesting.

318
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:24,169
You know, being able to work across multiple sports, um, and really pushing the needle on being,

319
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:28,850
you know, the most progressive of the club within the competition is always interesting to me.

320
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:36,200
Um, and finding creative, creative ways to create competitive advantages, um, that's what I like doing.

321
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,319
And um, I love where I am.

322
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:44,750
I work with the best owners in the world and my favorite sport in a town that I've grown to love.

323
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:50,579
Um. I don't know how you do a whole lot better than that, but, you know, don't shut the door on anything.

324
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:55,860
And and I still have an appetite to keep learning new things and and challenging myself.

325
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:03,030
So if this ever became anything less of a challenge and something appealing and more challenging came along, I would certainly consider it.

326
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:09,739
Yeah. That's fair. So, uh, the last question kind of just sort of to, to wrap this, um, you know,

327
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:14,150
that was kind of on, on Kevin, even personal side, but, you know, fast forwarding.

328
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:18,830
Um, what do you think? The business of football.

329
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:21,650
And, of course, your 11 New York Giants.

330
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:27,710
What would that look like in in ten years when we check back in, I mean, you dropped already how you're embracing AI tools, how,

331
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:34,549
you know, data and analytics have really taken a big presence, how players now look at themselves as entities a little bit differently.

332
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:38,660
Like where do you think things are in ten years out will evolve towards?

333
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:48,230
I think, um. I don't know if it's what I think or what I hope, so we're probably somewhere in between, but I hope it's even safer than it is now.

334
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:54,550
And we've made some progress in that space. I think, uh, I think we'll see in 18 game season.

335
00:29:54,560 --> 00:30:00,260
I think we'll see. Um, officiating will look very different in five, ten years.

336
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:05,330
It'll be mostly tech enabled and, you know, and hopefully better officiated because of it.

337
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:14,030
There'll be some growing pains, as we, you know, between tracking every inch of surface on a player and football's.

338
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:20,730
Surface, you know, will be able to eliminate the need for officials to call.

339
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:24,940
Legal motion. Um, alignment.

340
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:30,010
Offsides procedure. Um, all the things that should be done by technology.

341
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:37,719
Delay of game. Um, and then they can just focus on the really subjective calls like pass interference and holding and, and, and personal fouls.

342
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:42,129
So if we can get to that point, which I think we will, I'm on a committee that we're currently trying to solve for that now.

343
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:46,840
So, um, it's a ways off, but, you know, it won't all happen in one time.

344
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:52,180
But, you know, we'll take little bites at it over the years and introduce new technologies to officiating.

345
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:58,340
It'll get better and better over time, and I'm looking forward to that. Um, I think those are probably the three things that stick out.

346
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:03,160
I wouldn't be surprised if at some point. I don't know what I.

347
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:09,099
I couldn't define it. But then it'll probably have a moment in time where they're going to have to

348
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,760
address some kind of competition that they've never had to really address before.

349
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,230
I'm not sure what it is. I don't think it's a currently existing league.

350
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,730
I'm not even sure it's another football league, but something.

351
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:26,120
We'll come along, that we're going to have to really defend our place at the top of the sporting ecosystem.

352
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:30,500
And I think we've prepared for it, and I have no concerns about it, but I think it'll.

353
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,600
It'll happen. Might be something preexisting.

354
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,790
It might be the, you know, one of the thing I hope that we're going to be as more international in ten years.

355
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:46,990
Um, but that might be something that we. Might find some competition just in our size versus someone else's size.

356
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:51,280
Because if we can't get international like we want to, the NBA certainly will.

357
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:56,180
Hockey kind of already is. Baseball is, you know, we are competing in that way.

358
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:00,490
You know, F1, to the extent that it's a growing sport in North America, it's very international.

359
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:04,629
So you know, if we can we can nail international.

360
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,760
I think it becomes a lot easier to maintain our spot.

361
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:12,820
But if we don't, you know that's going to be areas where at the, you know sports can gain some ground on us.

362
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,610
Well, um, first and foremost, Kevin, thank you so much.

363
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,850
Um, as always, I learn a ton when I listen.

364
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:25,070
Uh, I think everyone along here will learn a ton as well.

365
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:29,350
I love your lessons. Uh, especially some of the tough ones early on.

366
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,470
Um, and, uh, you know, and just congrats.

367
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:40,270
I mean, I know how much you love what you do, and, uh, certainly doing it at the epicenter in New York, as you said,

368
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:46,200
is, uh, pretty enviable position, especially for, uh, when I knew you and, yes, you were going magic, Matt.

369
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:52,450
And I was the sports obsessed guy. And then you actually did it. And, uh, you've been very successful, and you've got some Super Bowl rings to boot.

370
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,839
And, uh, I just can't thank you enough for spending the time with us today.

371
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,389
I really appreciate it. Uh, it's an absolute pleasure. I wish I could be there in person to see all the, uh, or meet the students,

372
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:05,560
but, um, it's great to talk to you and and hope everyone has a great semester.

373
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:10,060
Yeah. Thank. Okay. Before you go, you just got to turn your shoulders. They can see that great logo in behind you.

374
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:16,780
There you go. There it is. This is, um. Actually, don't tell them this is actually the general manager seat in our draft room that I'm sitting in.

375
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:20,439
So, uh, so I think there's a there's a coup afoot if you walked in right now.

376
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,200
So that's it.
