1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,667
If you're asking that question, you're measuring
the WRONG things.

2
00:00:06,067 --> 00:00:08,781
Because Connor McDavid isn't worth $8 million to your organization.

3
00:00:10,181 --> 00:00:11,631
He's worth 30 to $40 million per year.

4
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:14,948
The problem isn't the numbers.

5
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:17,019
The problem is understanding how sport revenue

6
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:19,031
works DIFFERENTLY than almost any other business.

7
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:23,472
There's a revenue ecosystem at play
here—interdependencies that your CFO's

8
00:00:23,672 --> 00:00:25,482
spreadsheet will never capture.

9
00:00:26,182 --> 00:00:27,633
Media deals that hinge on star power.

10
00:00:29,033 --> 00:00:31,138
Sponsorships that activate around marquee players.

11
00:00:31,638 --> 00:00:32,714
Betting handles that spike

12
00:00:32,714 --> 00:00:34,539
when the best player in the world takes the ice.

13
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:38,232
This week, you're going to learn how to see that ecosystem.

14
00:00:38,932 --> 00:00:39,853
You'll map

15
00:00:40,053 --> 00:00:42,065
five major revenue streams in professional sport.

16
00:00:42,265 --> 00:00:43,981
You'll understand why they're

17
00:00:44,381 --> 00:00:45,583
interdependent.

18
00:00:45,783 --> 00:00:47,982
And by the end, you'll be able to defend that $100 million

19
00:00:47,982 --> 00:00:50,602
contract to a skeptical board—with numbers they can't argue with.

20
00:00:55,502 --> 00:00:59,811
But first, I want to know: 
Do you ALREADY have the knowledge to solve this problem?

21
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:03,224
Can you explain where that missing $22-32
million comes from?

22
00:01:03,724 --> 00:01:06,693
Right now, before you learn
anything this week, test yourself.

23
00:01:06,893 --> 00:01:07,785
Take the

24
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:10,169
diagnostic exercise that follows this video.

25
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:11,873
Be honest.

26
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:13,638
Reveal your knowledge

27
00:01:13,638 --> 00:01:15,430
gaps NOW—so we can fill them together.

28
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,779
Let's find out what you already know...

29
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:20,103
and what you're about to discover.
