00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,665
Professional sports generates
revenue from five major sources.

2
00:00:04,665 --> 00:00:08,106
Understanding these streams is essential for analyzing sports
business strategy.

3
00:00:08,306 --> 00:00:10,066
Let's break them down quickly.

4
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:18,702
Stream #1: Media Rights (40
to 60% of revenue).

5
00:00:18,902 --> 00:00:21,738
Broadcasting and streaming deals.

6
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:26,142
The NFL's current media rights total $110 billion over 11 years.

7
00:00:26,142 --> 00:00:29,490
This is the foundation of modern sports economics.

8
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,427
Stream #2: Ticketing & Live Events (20 to 30%).

9
00:00:34,427 --> 00:00:39,643
Not just ticket sales—luxury suites, dynamic
pricing, concessions, parking.

10
00:00:39,643 --> 00:00:43,692
Teams generate $40 to 50 per attendee beyond the ticket price.

11
00:00:45,092 --> 00:00:48,940
Stream #3: Sponsorship & Partnerships (15 to 25%).

12
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:54,390
Corporate deals like naming rights, jersey
sponsors, and category partnerships.

13
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,750
Scotiabank Arena pays $30 to 50 million per year for naming rights.

14
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,842
Stream #4: Merchandising & Licensing (5 to 10%).

15
00:01:04,042 --> 00:01:06,411
Jerseys, hats, video games.

16
00:01:06,611 --> 00:01:11,828
Often pooled and shared equally across teams to
maintain competitive balance.

17
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:17,076
Stream #5: Betting & Gaming 
(2 to 8%, growing fast).

18
00:01:17,276 --> 00:01:19,177
The newest frontier.

19
00:01:19,377 --> 00:01:25,606
Leagues earn billions through betting partnerships, data licensing,
and media integration.

20
00:01:25,806 --> 00:01:28,564
Growing 30 to 40% year-over-year.

21
00:01:33,664 --> 00:01:36,208
Key insight: These streams don't
exist in isolation.

22
00:01:36,408 --> 00:01:38,152
They're interconnected.

23
00:01:38,352 --> 00:01:40,444
Investment in one stream amplifies others.

24
00:01:40,444 --> 00:01:43,836
Successful organizations build revenue ecosystems, not portfolios.
