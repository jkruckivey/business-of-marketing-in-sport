1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,241
Sports bettors watch 40% more
live sports than non-bettors.

2
00:00:04,241 --> 00:00:05,780
They engage 3x more on digital platforms.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,754
They spend 2x more on merchandise.

4
00:00:07,954 --> 00:00:10,240
That's why betting operators pay premium sponsorship rates.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,550
Betting transforms passive
viewers into active participants.

6
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,140
When you have money on a game, every play matters.

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:26,256
That engagement translates to longer viewing times, more ad exposure,
and higher brand recall.

8
00:00:26,256 --> 00:00:31,183
For sponsors, bettors are the ultimate target audience—engaged,
affluent, and trackable.

9
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:34,983
Traditional sponsors struggle to prove ROI.

10
00:00:34,983 --> 00:00:37,383
How do you connect a jersey logo to shoe sales?

11
00:00:37,383 --> 00:00:39,720
Betting operators don't have this problem.

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,063
Every customer has an account.

13
00:00:42,463 --> 00:00:44,100
Every bet is tracked.

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,837
When FanDuel or DraftKings sponsors the NBA, they know exactly how

15
00:00:47,837 --> 00:00:52,258
many customers came from broadcast exposure vs.
social media vs. stadium signage.

16
00:00:52,258 --> 00:00:54,469
That attribution data is worth billions.

17
00:00:55,869 --> 00:00:59,975
This is why betting sponsors pay 20-30% premiums
over traditional sponsors.

18
00:00:59,975 --> 00:01:05,154
They're not just buying impressions—they're buying customers with
measurable lifetime value.

19
00:01:05,154 --> 00:01:08,754
A sports betting customer is worth $500-1,500 in lifetime revenue.

20
00:01:08,754 --> 00:01:12,986
If sponsorship drives 100,000 new customers, that's
$50-150 million in value.

21
00:01:14,386 --> 00:01:16,935
Next, you'll use the Betting Economics Calculator to model customer

22
00:01:16,935 --> 00:01:20,143
acquisition costs, lifetime value, and the ROI of
betting-integrated sponsorships.
