1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,755
FanDuel and DraftKings entered the market

2
00:00:03,755 --> 00:00:07,995
aggressively following the 2018 Supreme Court decision that legalized
sports betting across states.

3
00:00:07,995 --> 00:00:12,382
They pursued rapid expansion through substantial marketing
investments and sponsorship partnerships.

4
00:00:17,282 --> 00:00:19,754
When sports betting legalized state-by-state

5
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:23,215
starting in May 2018, operators faced a strategic choice: acquire

6
00:00:23,215 --> 00:00:28,098
customers now to establish market presence, or move cautiously and
risk losing market share.

7
00:00:28,098 --> 00:00:35,577
FanDuel and DraftKings chose aggressive expansion—spending heavily on
customer acquisition to build first-mover advantage in new markets.

8
00:00:36,977 --> 00:00:41,736
FanDuel's sponsorship strategy focuses on market penetration and
customer acquisition.

9
00:00:41,736 --> 00:00:45,506
Every NFL partnership, every stadium sponsorship, and every broadcast

10
00:00:45,506 --> 00:00:50,018
integration has a clear goal: drive customer adoption through
increased visibility.

11
00:00:50,018 --> 00:00:53,603
Unlike traditional sponsors measuring "brand awareness," betting

12
00:00:53,603 --> 00:00:58,733
operators measure cost-per-install and conversion metrics directly
tied to business outcomes.

13
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:03,224
Here's the case dilemma: What's the path to profitability?

14
00:01:03,224 --> 00:01:06,376
Aggressive market entry requires substantial investment.

15
00:01:06,376 --> 00:01:12,124
The question becomes: How do operators transition from customer
acquisition to sustainable profitability?

16
00:01:12,124 --> 00:01:17,860
Your analysis should evaluate unit economics and the factors that
determine long-term viability in this market.

17
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,187
As you read the FanDuel case, focus on customer economics:

18
00:01:22,187 --> 00:01:26,728
acquisition costs, lifetime value, retention rates,
and the timeline to profitability.

19
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:29,417
