1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,072
Serena Williams' career generated nearly $95
million in prize money over 27 years.

2
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:09,039
Her endorsement earnings over her career were substantial.

3
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:12,414
Yet her total brand equity—including her ventures, media presence,

4
00:00:12,414 --> 00:00:17,417
and business ownership—represents significantly more value than
either of those components alone.

5
00:00:18,817 --> 00:00:21,376
So where does that additional brand value come from?

6
00:00:21,376 --> 00:00:24,343
How do you BUILD a brand worth 5 times your on-field earnings?

7
00:00:25,743 --> 00:00:29,583
Here's what I've learned: Elite brand value isn't built on
performance alone.

8
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:35,808
Serena is one of the greatest athletes ever, but so are dozens of
tennis players who never reached 10 percent of her brand equity.

9
00:00:35,808 --> 00:00:38,251
The difference is strategic brand architecture.

10
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:40,113
Which revenue streams to prioritize.

11
00:00:40,113 --> 00:00:41,975
When to invest in post-career assets.

12
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:44,883
How to build equity in businesses you OWN, not just endorse.

13
00:00:46,283 --> 00:00:50,181
This week, you'll learn how elite athletes build
substantial personal brands.

14
00:00:50,181 --> 00:00:55,857
You'll understand the five revenue streams athletes use—and which
create long-term wealth versus short-term income.

15
00:00:55,857 --> 00:00:59,453
You'll explore why women's sports are attracting
significant investment.

16
00:00:59,453 --> 00:01:02,937
And you'll analyze strategic decisions that build generational wealth.

17
00:01:04,337 --> 00:01:07,596
But first: Can you already explain where that brand value comes from?

18
00:01:07,796 --> 00:01:09,982
Take the diagnostic exercise next.

19
00:01:10,182 --> 00:01:12,542
Reveal your gaps now—so we can fill them together.
