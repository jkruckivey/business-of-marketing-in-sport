1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,471
Every elite athlete has access
to five revenue streams.

2
00:00:05,471 --> 00:00:07,835
Most athletes optimize for one or two.

3
00:00:07,835 --> 00:00:15,368
The highest-net-worth athletes optimize for all five—and know which
ones build wealth versus which ones just pay bills.

4
00:00:16,768 --> 00:00:18,984
Stream one: Prize money and salary.

5
00:00:19,184 --> 00:00:21,678
This is what you earn competing.

6
00:00:21,878 --> 00:00:27,639
For Serena, nearly $95 million over 27 years—impressive, but it stops
when you stop playing.

7
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:31,437
Stream two: Endorsements.

8
00:00:31,837 --> 00:00:34,405
Brands pay you to represent them.

9
00:00:34,605 --> 00:00:39,997
This generates ongoing income, but you're renting your image—you
don't own anything.

10
00:00:41,397 --> 00:00:43,982
Stream three: Appearances and speaking.

11
00:00:43,982 --> 00:00:46,788
Corporate events, keynotes, charity galas.

12
00:00:46,788 --> 00:00:50,555
Typically 100 to 500,000 per appearance for elite athletes.

13
00:00:50,555 --> 00:00:52,845
High hourly rate, but doesn't scale.

14
00:00:54,445 --> 00:00:56,643
Stream four: Equity deals.

15
00:00:56,843 --> 00:00:59,576
Instead of cash, you take ownership stakes.

16
00:00:59,576 --> 00:01:05,780
Strategic investments in companies can generate significant returns
if those companies succeed.

17
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,874
Stream five: Owned businesses.

18
00:01:10,274 --> 00:01:12,473
You build and own the asset.

19
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:17,312
Through Serena Ventures, Williams manages a
portfolio of 85+ companies.

20
00:01:17,512 --> 00:01:19,658
S by Serena clothing line.

21
00:01:19,858 --> 00:01:23,225
These generate value whether she plays tennis or not.

22
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:28,965
The pattern is clear: Streams one through three trade time for money.

23
00:01:28,965 --> 00:01:32,108
Streams four and five build assets that compound.

24
00:01:32,108 --> 00:01:36,522
Elite athletes shift from renting their brand to owning their future.

25
00:01:37,922 --> 00:01:42,337
Next, you'll use the Athlete Brand Calculator to model these streams.

26
00:01:42,337 --> 00:01:46,527
See how the mix changes an athlete's long-term wealth trajectory.
