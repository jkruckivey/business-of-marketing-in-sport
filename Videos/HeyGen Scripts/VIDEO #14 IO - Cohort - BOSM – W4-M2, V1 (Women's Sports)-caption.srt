1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,454
Women's sports sponsorship is
experiencing rapid growth.

2
00:00:06,454 --> 00:00:14,025
The NWSL quadrupled sponsorship revenue over five years to reach
approximately $60 million in 2024.

3
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:20,349
The WNBA more than doubled its sponsorship revenue
to $55 million in the same period.

4
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:25,782
This isn't charity—it's smart money recognizing an undervalued asset.

5
00:00:30,682 --> 00:00:32,781
Here's the investment thesis.

6
00:00:32,781 --> 00:00:36,008
Women's sports audiences are growing rapidly.

7
00:00:36,008 --> 00:00:40,366
The 2023 Women's World Cup drew significant global viewership.

8
00:00:40,366 --> 00:00:43,916
Women's college basketball viewership has surged.

9
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:52,793
Yet sponsorship dollars lag far behind—women's sports still represent
a small percentage of total sports sponsorship spending.

10
00:00:52,993 --> 00:00:55,430
That gap is the opportunity.

11
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,294
Why now?

12
00:00:58,694 --> 00:01:01,050
Three converging factors.

13
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:09,723
First, media coverage finally caught up—streaming platforms need
content, and women's sports deliver engaged audiences.

14
00:01:09,723 --> 00:01:17,147
Second, brands discovered that women's sports fans are more loyal and
more likely to purchase from sponsors.

15
00:01:17,147 --> 00:01:25,862
Third, athletes like Serena Williams, Megan Rapinoe, and Caitlin
Clark proved individual stars can drive massive engagement.

16
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,060
The smart money is moving fast.

17
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,295
Major media companies are securing women's sports rights.

18
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:39,782
Financial services brands are becoming jersey
sponsors and official partners.

19
00:01:39,782 --> 00:01:42,687
Investment rounds are filling up quickly.

20
00:01:42,687 --> 00:01:49,320
These aren't feel-good investments—they're bets on a market that's
been underpriced for decades.

21
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:59,090
The question for brands: Do you sponsor women's sports now while
valuations are relatively low, or wait until prices catch up?

22
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,801
Your analysis should factor in this growth trajectory.
