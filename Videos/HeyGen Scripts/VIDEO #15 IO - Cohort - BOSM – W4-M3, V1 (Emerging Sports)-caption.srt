1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,543
Pickleball has grown dramatically in recent years.

2
00:00:05,543 --> 00:00:09,167
Padel is the fastest-growing racket sport in Europe.

3
00:00:09,167 --> 00:00:12,469
Esports viewership rivals traditional sports.

4
00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:16,416
How do you evaluate whether to invest in an emerging sport?

5
00:00:19,816 --> 00:00:21,656
Use the four-factor framework.

6
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:24,333
Factor one: Demographic breadth.

7
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:26,714
Does it appeal to multiple age groups?

8
00:00:26,714 --> 00:00:28,827
Broader appeal means staying power.

9
00:00:28,827 --> 00:00:32,985
Narrow demographics create growth risk if the audience doesn't expand.

10
00:00:34,585 --> 00:00:36,721
Factor two: Accessibility.

11
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:38,575
Can anyone play?

12
00:00:38,775 --> 00:00:41,297
Low barriers to entry mean faster adoption.

13
00:00:42,897 --> 00:00:45,238
Factor three: Media viability.

14
00:00:45,638 --> 00:00:47,978
Can it be broadcast or streamed?

15
00:00:48,178 --> 00:00:52,541
Some sports work on traditional media, others
thrive on digital platforms.

16
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:55,744
Understand the broadcast economics before investing.

17
00:00:57,144 --> 00:00:59,735
Factor four: Monetization infrastructure.

18
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,412
Are there leagues, tours, venues?

19
00:01:02,612 --> 00:01:06,633
You need commercial structure to create sponsorship opportunities.

20
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:09,292
Without structure, there's no revenue model.

21
00:01:10,692 --> 00:01:13,350
Apply this to emerging sports opportunities.

22
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,554
Each property has different strengths and weaknesses.

23
00:01:16,554 --> 00:01:20,030
Some have demographic breadth but limited infrastructure.

24
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,438
Others have strong media properties but narrow audiences.

25
00:01:24,838 --> 00:01:28,383
The right answer depends on your timeline and risk tolerance.

26
00:01:29,783 --> 00:01:35,867
Your analyst's interview shows how to validate emerging sports
opportunities before scaling.

27
00:01:35,867 --> 00:01:42,478
Watch for the proof-of-concept methodology—that's how professional
investors evaluate new markets.
