1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,783
Serena Williams is not just an
exceptional tennis player.

2
00:00:05,783 --> 00:00:11,574
She's a case study in how athletes transform
athletic excellence into business empires.

3
00:00:11,574 --> 00:00:16,979
Your analysis should focus on the strategic
decisions, not just the achievements.

4
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:24,571
The case presents three strategic pivots.

5
00:00:24,771 --> 00:00:27,439
First, from endorser to investor.

6
00:00:27,639 --> 00:00:32,872
Serena shifted from taking endorsement cash to
taking equity stakes in companies.

7
00:00:32,872 --> 00:00:38,928
Strategic investments in emerging companies created opportunities for
significant returns.

8
00:00:40,528 --> 00:00:43,121
Second, from athlete to founder.

9
00:00:43,321 --> 00:00:46,985
Serena Ventures now manages a portfolio of 85+ companies.

10
00:00:46,985 --> 00:00:50,573
She's not just investing—she's building a venture firm.

11
00:00:50,573 --> 00:00:52,891
Third, from individual to platform.

12
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:58,274
S by Serena isn't just a clothing line—it's a platform for other
women entrepreneurs.

13
00:00:58,274 --> 00:01:04,031
She's leveraging her brand to amplify others, which increases her
influence and deal flow.

14
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:09,787
The question isn't whether Serena is successful—it's whether her
playbook is replicable.

15
00:01:09,787 --> 00:01:12,105
Can other athletes follow this path?

16
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:14,348
What did she have that others don't?

17
00:01:14,348 --> 00:01:16,740
What did she do that others could copy?

18
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,682
As you analyze the case, focus on timing.

19
00:01:20,882 --> 00:01:23,251
When did she start investing?

20
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:25,769
When did she launch Serena Ventures?

21
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:29,208
How did she balance business building with competing?

22
00:01:30,608 --> 00:01:34,859
The sequencing matters—she built business infrastructure while still

23
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:39,668
playing, so she had momentum when she transitioned away from
competitive tennis.

24
00:01:39,668 --> 00:01:45,104
The AI Case Coach will help you map Serena's decisions to the five
revenue streams framework.

25
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:51,516

for money to building compounding assets.
