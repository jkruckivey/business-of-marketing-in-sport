00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,763
Executives at heritage sports properties face an

2
00:00:03,763 --> 00:00:08,045
impossible choice: Preserve tradition and watch revenues decline, or
innovate aggressively and risk losing your soul.

3
00:00:12,945 --> 00:00:15,429
Imagine you're CEO of a heritage institution.

4
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:20,524
Your institution generates steady annual revenue—respectable, but
flat over several years.

5
00:00:20,524 --> 00:00:25,747
Your board proposes transformation: VR experiences, AI-powered tours,
pop-ups in new markets.

6
00:00:25,747 --> 00:00:29,632
The projections show you could increase annual revenue substantially.

7
00:00:29,832 --> 00:00:31,415
But there's a catch.

8
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:35,691
Your curatorial staff resigns in protest—they call it
commercialization.

9
00:00:35,891 --> 00:00:37,855
Long-time members cancel.

10
00:00:38,055 --> 00:00:40,730
Donors who value authenticity threaten to leave.

11
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:46,271
If you lose credibility, you lose donations AND your position as the
authoritative voice in your field.

12
00:00:46,271 --> 00:00:51,685
The question isn't "Can we make more money?" It's "Can we grow
WITHOUT losing what makes us valuable?"

13
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:54,041
This is the heritage monetization dilemma.

14
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:56,334
You can't just apply Weeks 1-4 frameworks.

15
00:00:56,334 --> 00:00:58,691
Revenue matters, but so does authenticity.

16
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:02,003
Media strategy works, but not if it commodifies your history.

17
00:01:02,003 --> 00:01:06,206
This week, you'll learn frameworks for balancing
tradition with innovation.

18
00:01:06,206 --> 00:01:09,327
You'll hear from executives who've made these decisions.

19
00:01:09,327 --> 00:01:11,811
And you'll develop your own strategic vision.

20
00:01:11,811 --> 00:01:13,184
But first: Could you solve this now?

21
00:01:13,184 --> 00:01:16,571
If I gave you this challenge, could you increase revenue while
preserving credibility?

22
00:01:16,771 --> 00:01:18,507
Take the diagnostic to find out.
