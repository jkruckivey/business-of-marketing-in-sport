1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,797
Heritage properties face a unique constraint: Your
authenticity IS your asset.

2
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:09,204
Monetize too aggressively, and you destroy the very
thing people value.

3
00:00:09,204 --> 00:00:11,493
But refuse to evolve, and you become irrelevant.

4
00:00:16,393 --> 00:00:18,247
Use the Heritage Balance Grid.

5
00:00:18,247 --> 00:00:22,025
On one axis: Revenue Impact—how much money does this generate?

6
00:00:22,025 --> 00:00:27,016
On the other axis: Authenticity Risk—how much does
this threaten our credibility?

7
00:00:27,016 --> 00:00:29,225
Plot every opportunity on this grid.

8
00:00:29,225 --> 00:00:34,715
High revenue, low risk: Digital archive access,
expanded merchandise, membership tiers.

9
00:00:34,915 --> 00:00:36,841
These are obvious wins.

10
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:44,241
Low revenue, high risk: Branded experiences that feel disconnected
from mission, entertainment-first initiatives.

11
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:46,866
These require extreme caution.

12
00:00:47,066 --> 00:00:50,131
The dangerous quadrant is high revenue, high risk.

13
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:54,480
An initiative might generate significant revenue, but if stakeholders

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,971
perceive it as inconsistent with your mission,
donors and members revolt.

15
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:04,888
The question isn't whether it makes money—it's whether it makes money
AND preserves what matters.

16
00:01:04,888 --> 00:01:08,024
Here's the key insight: Authenticity is not binary.

17
00:01:08,024 --> 00:01:11,090
You can extend reach without replacing substance.

18
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,367
Digital access to archives serves your mission AND generates revenue.

19
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:17,208
That's alignment.

20
00:01:17,608 --> 00:01:20,033
Three tests for any initiative.

21
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:23,703
First, does it serve your mission or replace it?

22
00:01:23,703 --> 00:01:26,550
Mission-aligned programs vs. mission-compromising programs.

23
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,332
Second, would your most loyal stakeholders accept it?

24
00:01:30,332 --> 00:01:33,490
If core community members say "that's not who we
are," listen carefully.

25
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,677
Third, is it reversible?

26
00:01:36,877 --> 00:01:38,947
Experiments are fine; permanent damage isn't.

27
00:01:40,347 --> 00:01:45,058
The executives you'll hear from use versions of this framework—but
they draw the lines in different places.

28
00:01:45,058 --> 00:01:47,232
Watch for where they agree and where they diverge.
