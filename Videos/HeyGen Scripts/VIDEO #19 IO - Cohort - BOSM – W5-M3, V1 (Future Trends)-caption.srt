00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,589
What will sports business look like in 2030?

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:06,967
Five trends are reshaping the industry.

3
00:00:06,967 --> 00:00:12,564
Understanding them helps you build strategies that last, not just
strategies that work today.

4
00:00:17,464 --> 00:00:20,911
Trend one: Direct-to-consumer everything.

5
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:28,166
Leagues and teams are building their own streaming platforms, apps,
and membership programs.

6
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:34,333
Why share revenue with broadcasters when you can
own the customer relationship?

7
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:40,682
The major North American leagues are all investing
heavily in D2C infrastructure.

8
00:00:40,682 --> 00:00:44,400
Trend two: Sports betting integration deepens.

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,481
We're moving from sponsorship to embedded products.

10
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:57,823
Imagine watching a game where betting is integrated into the
broadcast—odds updating in real-time, one-click wagering.

11
00:00:57,823 --> 00:01:01,994
This changes media rights valuations fundamentally.

12
00:01:01,994 --> 00:01:06,076
Trend three: Women's sports reach parity economics.

13
00:01:06,076 --> 00:01:14,601
Within the next decade, top women's leagues will command valuations
comparable to men's second-tier leagues.

14
00:01:14,601 --> 00:01:18,228
Early investors will see significant returns.

15
00:01:18,228 --> 00:01:22,309
The WNBA trajectory shows this is already happening.

16
00:01:22,309 --> 00:01:25,302
Trend four: AI transforms operations.

17
00:01:25,302 --> 00:01:33,283
From ticket pricing to injury prediction to fan engagement, AI is
being deployed across every function.

18
00:01:33,283 --> 00:01:39,156
The teams that master AI-driven personalization will win the fan
engagement battle.

19
00:01:39,156 --> 00:01:42,908
Trend five: Heritage becomes competitive advantage.

20
00:01:42,908 --> 00:01:49,514
As sports become more commercial, the properties with authentic
history become more valuable.

21
00:01:49,514 --> 00:01:56,284
Storied franchises and legacy organizations aren't just teams—they're
cultural institutions.

22
00:01:56,284 --> 00:02:02,483
That heritage creates pricing power and fan loyalty that new
franchises can't replicate.

23
00:02:02,483 --> 00:02:07,050
Your league executive's vision reflects several of these trends.

24
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:14,309
They're balancing entertainment innovation with heritage preservation
while planning for expansion.

25
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:19,284
Their interview shows how league leaders think about 10-year horizons.
