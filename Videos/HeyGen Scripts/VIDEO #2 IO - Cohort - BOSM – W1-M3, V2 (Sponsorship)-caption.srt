1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,911
While media rights and ticketing depend on the

2
00:00:04,911 --> 00:00:10,732
game itself, two revenue streams are driven by brand value:
sponsorship and merchandising.

3
00:00:10,732 --> 00:00:16,927
Let's see how teams monetize their brands through corporate
partnerships and consumer products.

4
00:00:21,827 --> 00:00:24,687
Sponsorship: 15 to 25% of Revenue.

5
00:00:24,687 --> 00:00:33,957
The most visible sponsorship deals are naming rights: Scotiabank
Arena in Toronto—$800 million over 20 years.

6
00:00:33,957 --> 00:00:37,705
That's $40 million per year just for the name.

7
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:42,143
Jersey sponsorship arrived in North America in 2017.

8
00:00:42,143 --> 00:00:45,792
The NBA allows a 2.5-inch patch on uniforms.

9
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:53,978
Top deals reach $20-30 million per year—Golden State Warriors and
Rakuten, $20 million annually.

10
00:00:53,978 --> 00:00:59,698
But the best sponsors don't just buy logos—they create experiences.

11
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:10,349
Scotiabank's "Scene plus Night" at Leafs games integrates their
loyalty program with ticket offers and in-arena experiences.

12
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:14,393
Fans remember positive moments, not just a logo.

13
00:01:14,393 --> 00:01:20,113
Key sponsorship categories: - Naming rights (15-50 Million/year) -

14
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:24,847
Jersey/uniform patches (5-30Million/year) - Category

15
00:01:24,847 --> 00:01:31,454
partnerships—official bank, beer, airline (500
thousand-10Million/year).

16
00:01:36,354 --> 00:01:38,540
Merchandising: 5-10% of Revenue.

17
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:44,290
Most major North American leagues— NFL, NHL,
MLB— use a centralized model.

18
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:49,115
The league manages all licensing, then splits
revenue equally among teams.

19
00:01:49,315 --> 00:01:50,116
Why?

20
00:01:50,516 --> 00:01:52,448
Competitive balance.

21
00:01:52,648 --> 00:01:59,584
This prevents the Yankees and Cowboys from dominating merchandise
sales and creating massive revenue gaps.

22
00:02:00,984 --> 00:02:07,995
Revenue spikes during championship runs—sales see significant
increases during peak playoff performance.

23
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:11,510
Star acquisitions drive dramatic spikes— when

24
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:18,069
LeBron James signed with the Lakers, his jersey sales saw a 600%
spike within hours of the announcement.

25
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:25,429
New designs generate consistent revenue—NBA
"City Edition" jerseys generate over $100 million annually.

26
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:33,312
Digital commerce transformed merchandising—teams now sell globally
without retail partnerships.

27
00:02:38,212 --> 00:02:41,680
Key insight: These are
brand-driven revenue streams.

28
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,422
The stronger your brand, the more valuable your sponsorship inventory
and the more merchandise you sell.

29
00:02:48,822 --> 00:02:52,564
