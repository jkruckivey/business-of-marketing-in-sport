1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,837
This case study isn't about hockey specifically.

2
00:00:04,837 --> 00:00:11,389
It's about every heritage property facing the same dilemma: How do
you grow without becoming something you're not?

3
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:19,306
The case presents a real strategic tension.

4
00:00:19,306 --> 00:00:25,096
The Hockey Hall of Fame generates revenue from
admission, retail, and hospitality.

5
00:00:25,096 --> 00:00:31,865
The board wants to propose growth initiatives that could
substantially increase annual revenue.

6
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:36,513
The staff and donors want to preserve the institution's integrity.

7
00:00:36,513 --> 00:00:39,204
Both sides have legitimate arguments.

8
00:00:39,204 --> 00:00:43,933
Here's what makes this case hard: The growth opportunities ARE real.

9
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:47,358
VR experiences could attract younger audiences.

10
00:00:47,358 --> 00:00:50,539
International pop-ups could tap new markets.

11
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:53,393
The revenue projections aren't fantasy.

12
00:00:53,593 --> 00:00:55,969
But the risks are also real.

13
00:00:56,169 --> 00:01:01,795
Heritage institutions that over-commercialize lose
credibility permanently.

14
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:08,401
Once you're perceived as a theme park, you can't go back to being a
serious cultural institution.

15
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:15,088
The curatorial staff and donors aren't being stubborn—they're
protecting something valuable.

16
00:01:15,088 --> 00:01:17,697
Your analysis should avoid two traps.

17
00:01:17,697 --> 00:01:20,388
Trap one: Assuming growth always wins.

18
00:01:20,388 --> 00:01:23,242
Sometimes preservation IS the strategy.

19
00:01:23,242 --> 00:01:26,178
Trap two: Assuming tradition always wins.

20
00:01:26,178 --> 00:01:30,156
Institutions that refuse all change become irrelevant.

21
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:35,958
Where exactly is the line between acceptable innovation and
mission-compromise?

22
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:43,252
That line is different for every organization—your job is to find
where it is for a heritage institution.

23
00:01:43,252 --> 00:01:49,303
As you watch the executive interviews, note how each leader defines
their boundaries.

24
00:01:49,303 --> 00:01:54,442
Their answers reveal different philosophies about heritage and growth.
