1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,596
Congratulations!

2
00:00:02,596 --> 00:00:04,644
You've completed five weeks of the Business of Sports Marketing.

3
00:00:04,644 --> 00:00:07,511
You now have frameworks that working professionals use to make
million-dollar decisions.

4
00:00:07,511 --> 00:00:09,038
Let's connect everything before your capstone.

5
00:00:13,938 --> 00:00:18,746
Week 1 taught you revenue ecosystems—the five
streams and how they interconnect.

6
00:00:18,746 --> 00:00:25,436
Week 2 showed you media rights economics—how streaming changes
valuations and the risks of long-term contracts.

7
00:00:25,436 --> 00:00:30,593
Week 3 covered sponsorship and betting—ROI frameworks and the
attribution advantage.

8
00:00:30,593 --> 00:00:36,795
Week 4 explored athlete brands and emerging sports—the five revenue
streams and evaluation frameworks.

9
00:00:36,795 --> 00:00:40,140
Week 5 added the final piece: Heritage and future trends.

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,694
Not everything should be optimized for short-term revenue.

11
00:00:43,694 --> 00:00:46,691
Sometimes preservation creates long-term value.

12
00:00:46,691 --> 00:00:53,869
Your capstone project—developing a strategy for an emerging sports
franchise—requires you to integrate all five weeks.

13
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:56,590
You're not just designing a brand.

14
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,647
You're building a business case that considers:

15
00:00:59,647 --> 00:01:01,877
Revenue ecosystem design from Week 1.

16
00:01:01,877 --> 00:01:04,176
Media rights implications from Week 2.

17
00:01:04,376 --> 00:01:06,897
Sponsorship strategy from Week 3.

18
00:01:07,097 --> 00:01:10,512
Market positioning and athlete partnerships from Week 4.

19
00:01:10,512 --> 00:01:13,509
And heritage balance and future trends from Week 5.

20
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:15,940
Your strategy needs to achieve multiple objectives.

21
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,749
It should build sustainable revenue across all five streams.

22
00:01:18,749 --> 00:01:21,072
It should position your franchise competitively.

23
00:01:21,072 --> 00:01:23,125
It should be financially viable from day one.

24
00:01:23,325 --> 00:01:25,338
This is real strategic thinking.

25
00:01:25,538 --> 00:01:31,102
The frameworks you've learned aren't academic exercises—they're the
same tools executives use to make these decisions.

26
00:01:31,302 --> 00:01:33,153
Good luck with your capstone.

27
00:01:33,553 --> 00:01:35,404
You have everything you need.

28
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,654
Now show us what you can build.
