1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,948
Amazon paid $1 billion per year
for NFL Thursday Night Football.

2
00:00:05,948 --> 00:00:09,822
Rogers paid $5.2 billion over 12 years for NHL Canadian rights.

3
00:00:09,822 --> 00:00:13,478
How do media companies decide what sports content is worth?

4
00:00:13,478 --> 00:00:15,890
The Five-Factor Valuation Framework.

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,022
Factor 1: Audience Size and Demographics.

6
00:00:19,022 --> 00:00:22,531
Larger, more valuable audiences command higher prices.

7
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:30,573
NFL regular season games average 17-19 million viewers with premium
demographics—males 18-49, a demographic with a high income.

8
00:00:30,573 --> 00:00:35,179
Advertisers pay $50 to $70 per thousand
viewers—double non-sports rates.

9
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:40,431
Here's a critical point: Model viewership
trends, not just current numbers.

10
00:00:40,631 --> 00:00:43,324
Rogers assumed stable NHL ratings.

11
00:00:43,524 --> 00:00:47,691
They experienced ratings declines of 12% or more in recent seasons.

12
00:00:47,691 --> 00:00:50,469
That's hundreds of millions in lost revenue.

13
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:54,354
Factor 2: Exclusivity and Competition.

14
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,248
More bidders equals higher prices.

15
00:00:57,448 --> 00:01:00,737
Exclusive rights cost 2-3x more than non-exclusive.

16
00:01:00,737 --> 00:01:06,220
When Amazon, Apple, and traditional networks
compete for NFL rights, prices skyrocket.

17
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:13,391
NFL deal increased significantly from 2011 to 2022, driven by
competitive bidding among multiple platforms.

18
00:01:13,391 --> 00:01:16,090
Factor 3: Content Volume and Scheduling.

19
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,480
Quality matters more than quantity.

20
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,181
One NFL primetime game is worth 10-15 mid-week NHL games.

21
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:29,506
Concentrated scheduling windows—NFL Sundays—create predictable
audience habits and higher per-game value.

22
00:01:32,906 --> 00:01:34,933
Factor 4: Brand Alignment and Sponsorship.

23
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:37,672
Sponsorship revenue can subsidize 20-35% of rights costs.

24
00:01:37,672 --> 00:01:43,972
Strong brand alignment with sponsor categories (automotive, beer,
financial services) creates premium sponsorship opportunities.

25
00:01:43,972 --> 00:01:47,588
Without sponsorship integration, profitability
becomes harder to achieve.

26
00:01:48,088 --> 00:01:49,622
Factor 5: Platform Strategy Fit.

27
00:01:49,622 --> 00:01:53,511
Sometimes you pay more than a property is "worth"
because it serves strategic goals.

28
00:01:53,511 --> 00:01:56,634
Amazon's $1 billion per year for NFL drives subscriber acquisition

29
00:01:56,634 --> 00:02:01,017
and loyalty for Prime membership, with reported record Prime sign-ups
during NFL broadcasts.

30
00:02:01,017 --> 00:02:03,865
However, strategic value must be measurable and achievable.

31
00:02:04,365 --> 00:02:07,488
Warning: Strategic value
justifications must be grounded in data.

32
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:10,610
Rogers justified overpaying with "subscriber defense" logic—but

33
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,281
couldn't prove the relationship between NHL rights
and subscriber retention.

34
00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:17,513
When subscribers left anyway, the case collapsed.NFL deal increased

35
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:21,731
significantly from 2011 to 2022, driven by competitive bidding among
multiple platforms.
