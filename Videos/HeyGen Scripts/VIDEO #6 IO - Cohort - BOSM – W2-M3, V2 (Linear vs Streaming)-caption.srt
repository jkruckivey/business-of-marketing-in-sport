1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,020
For 50 years, sports media economics were simple:
Broadcast games on TV, sell ads, make money.

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,587
Then streaming arrived.

3
00:00:11,787 --> 00:00:16,496
Linear TV vs. Streaming: Fundamentally different economics.

4
00:00:16,696 --> 00:00:19,774
Let's compare them side-by-side.

5
00:00:21,574 --> 00:00:23,318
Revenue Models.

6
00:00:24,918 --> 00:00:29,628
Linear TV: Advertising at 70-80% plus carriage fees at 20-30%.

7
00:00:29,628 --> 00:00:34,249
Cable providers distribute sports networks to subscribers.

8
00:00:34,249 --> 00:00:38,603
Ad rates: $40-70 per thousand viewers for premium sports.

9
00:00:38,603 --> 00:00:43,402
Streaming: Subscriptions at 80-95% plus optional ads at 5-20%.

10
00:00:43,402 --> 00:00:46,068
Fans pay $10-30 per month directly.

11
00:00:46,068 --> 00:00:52,022
More predictable revenue—subscribers pay monthly
regardless of viewership.

12
00:00:52,022 --> 00:00:55,399
Key difference: Linear monetizes audience.

13
00:00:55,599 --> 00:00:58,765
Streaming monetizes subscribers.

14
00:01:00,565 --> 00:01:02,398
Cost Structures.

15
00:01:02,598 --> 00:01:09,174
Linear TV: Rights fees at 60-70% plus production at 20-30% plus low
distribution costs.

16
00:01:09,174 --> 00:01:12,906
Infrastructure already exists—cable networks.

17
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:20,193
Streaming: Rights fees at 40-50% plus technology at 25-35% plus
customer acquisition at 20-30%.

18
00:01:20,193 --> 00:01:25,081
Must build platform from scratch—$50-100M initial investment.

19
00:01:25,081 --> 00:01:29,814
Customer acquisition cost: $50-200 per subscriber.

20
00:01:29,814 --> 00:01:34,127
Front-loaded costs—heavy Year 1-3 investment.

21
00:01:38,627 --> 00:01:40,484
Profitability Timelines.

22
00:01:40,984 --> 00:01:43,567
Linear TV: Immediate if priced right.

23
00:01:43,567 --> 00:01:49,703
If ad revenue plus carriage fees exceeds rights plus production,
you're profitable Day 1.

24
00:01:49,703 --> 00:01:57,292
But assumes stable viewership—cord-cutting risk.Streaming: 3-5 years
using customer lifetime value model.

25
00:01:57,292 --> 00:02:01,732
Year 1-2: Heavy losses building platform, acquiring customers.

26
00:02:01,932 --> 00:02:04,854
Year 3-4: Approaching break-even.

27
00:02:05,254 --> 00:02:07,450
Year 5+: Profitability.

28
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:13,382
Requires customer lifetime value exceeding customer
acquisition cost.Key Risks.

29
00:02:13,882 --> 00:02:18,887
Linear TV: Cord-cutting, audience fragmentation,
generational shift.

30
00:02:18,887 --> 00:02:23,731
Canadian market: Traditional pay TV declined from approximately 11.2

31
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:28,414
million subscribers in 2014 to 9.7 million in 2024—about 13% decline

32
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:35,760
over a decade.Streaming: High churn, price sensitivity, competition
from tech giants, technology costs.

33
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:43,349
Sports-specific streaming services experience higher seasonal churn
driven by sports calendar variations.

34
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:45,706
Most successful strategy?

35
00:02:45,906 --> 00:02:46,971
Hybrid.

36
00:02:47,171 --> 00:02:52,580
Maintain linear TV cash flow while building streaming for the
future.The risk?

37
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,536
Cord-cutting cannibalizes faster than streaming grows.

38
00:02:56,536 --> 00:03:01,380
This is what happened to Rogers—lost cable subscribers before gaining

39
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:08,081
enough streaming subscribers.In your simulation, you'll choose:
Linear, streaming, or hybrid?
