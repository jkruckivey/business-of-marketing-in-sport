1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,543
I want to start Week 3 with a
problem that haunts every CMO I know.

2
00:00:05,543 --> 00:00:10,890
Major brands spend hundreds of millions of dollars annually on sports
sponsorships globally.

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:18,310
For example, Nike's comprehensive sports sponsorship portfolio spans
every league, athlete, and major property you can think of.

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,722
Your CFO looks at this budget and asks: What are we
getting for this investment?

5
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:26,532
So you show them the metrics: billions of social media impressions,

6
00:00:26,532 --> 00:00:30,609
billions of TV viewers reached, high brand
awareness among sports fans.

7
00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:34,152
And they ask the killer follow-up: How many shoes did that sell?

8
00:00:34,352 --> 00:00:35,387
Silence.

9
00:00:35,587 --> 00:00:39,664
Because here's the uncomfortable truth: most sponsorship ROI is fuzzy.

10
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,071
We measure impressions, not conversions.

11
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:44,309
But something changed in 2018.

12
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:50,325
Sports betting legalization created sponsors who CAN measure
conversion: FanDuel, DraftKings, BetMGM.

13
00:00:51,725 --> 00:00:59,011
When a betting operator sponsors a team, they know exactly how many
people downloaded the app, placed a bet, and became customers.

14
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:02,840
That attribution loop changes everything about sponsorship valuation.

15
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,501
This week, you'll learn to think like both

16
00:01:05,501 --> 00:01:09,639
sides: the brand trying to prove ROI, and the
betting operator who actually can.

17
00:01:09,639 --> 00:01:15,259
By the end of this week, you'll design an activation plan that
answers the CFO's question with data, not hope.
