1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,614
How do leaders decide where to
invest in sports partnerships?

2
00:00:05,814 --> 00:00:07,981
How do they measure success?

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,725
A common mistake: thinking the rights fee is the investment.

4
00:00:11,925 --> 00:00:12,842
Wrong.

5
00:00:13,042 --> 00:00:16,586
For every $1 in rights fees, brands spend $2-3 on activation.

6
00:00:16,586 --> 00:00:24,022
If we pay $5 million to sponsor a team, we'll spend $10-15 million
amplifying it through ads, hospitality, content, and retail.

7
00:00:24,022 --> 00:00:28,956
The real question isn't "Can we afford the rights?"—it's "Can we
activate at scale?"

8
00:00:28,956 --> 00:00:32,569
We measure three layers: Reach—how many people saw our brand?

9
00:00:32,769 --> 00:00:35,145
Engagement—did they interact?

10
00:00:35,545 --> 00:00:37,783
And Conversion—did they buy?

11
00:00:37,983 --> 00:00:41,457
Reach is easy—broadcast impressions, social media views.

12
00:00:41,457 --> 00:00:45,766
Engagement requires data partnerships—app downloads, website visits.

13
00:00:45,766 --> 00:00:49,379
Conversion is hardest—tying sales to sponsorship exposure.

14
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,881
That's where betting partnerships excel.

15
00:00:51,881 --> 00:00:58,830
When we partner with FanDuel or DraftKings, we access first-party
data: who bet, what they bet on, when they converted.

16
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,069
That attribution loop is impossible with traditional jersey sponsors.

17
00:01:03,069 --> 00:01:09,879
Sports betting operators offer co-marketing deals where we share
customer acquisition costs and conversion data.

18
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:13,979
It's why betting-integrated sponsorships command 20-30% premiums.

19
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,638
Your activation plan this week needs to answer: What's the reach?

20
00:01:16,838 --> 00:01:18,739
What's the engagement mechanism?

21
00:01:19,139 --> 00:01:20,848
How do we measure conversion?

22
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:22,547
Think like a CFO, not just a marketer.
