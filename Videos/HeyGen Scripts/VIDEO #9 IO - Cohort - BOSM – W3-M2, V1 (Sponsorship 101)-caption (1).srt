00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,451
Why does Coca-Cola pay FIFA hundreds of millions
to sponsor the World Cup?

2
00:00:06,451 --> 00:00:11,043
Because 3.5 billion people watch it— but that's
not the whole story.

3
00:00:11,043 --> 00:00:19,083
Sponsorship has two costs: rights fees—what you pay the property—and
activation costs—what you spend amplifying the partnership.

4
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:22,960
If a brand pays a property $300M per year in rights, they'll spend

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,274
$600-900M in activation— ads during matches,
retail displays, hospitality, branded content.

6
00:00:29,274 --> 00:00:31,643
The rights fee is just the entry ticket.

7
00:00:31,643 --> 00:00:34,371
In exchange, sponsors receive three things.

8
00:00:34,371 --> 00:00:38,751
First, Reach—logo exposure across broadcasts, stadiums, anddigital.

9
00:00:39,251 --> 00:00:43,845
Second, Engagement—branded activations,
hospitality, fan experiences.

10
00:00:44,345 --> 00:00:49,873
Third, Category exclusivity—major sponsors block
competitors from the same tournament.

11
00:00:49,873 --> 00:00:53,821
That exclusivity premium is worth 30-50% of the rights fee alone.

12
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:59,562
Brands measure sponsorship like advertising: cost per thousand
impressions, or CPM.

13
00:00:59,562 --> 00:01:03,007
Premium sports advertising reaches $5,000-10,000 CPM.

14
00:01:03,007 --> 00:01:07,656
Sponsorship properties typically command lower CPMs based on
frequency and context.

15
00:01:07,856 --> 00:01:09,120
Why lower CPM?

16
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,657
Frequency.

17
00:01:10,857 --> 00:01:13,467
Fans see a jersey sponsor 20-30 times per season.

18
00:01:13,467 --> 00:01:16,842
That repetition builds brand recall better than one-time ads.

19
00:01:18,242 --> 00:01:22,317
Next, you'll use the Sponsorship Valuation
Calculator to model real deals.

20
00:01:22,317 --> 00:01:28,293
Input reach, frequency, and costs to calculate CPM and exposure
value— the first step in ROI analysis.
