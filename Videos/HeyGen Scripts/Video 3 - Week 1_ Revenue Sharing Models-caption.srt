1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,369
Unlike most industries, professional sports
leagues NEED their competitors to thrive.

2
00:00:08,569 --> 00:00:09,409
Why?

3
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:15,808
Because competitive balance creates a better product—and makes
everyone more money.

4
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:18,781
This is the logic behind revenue sharing.

5
00:00:20,181 --> 00:00:23,238
Model 1: NFL—Maximum sharing, 60% shared.

6
00:00:23,238 --> 00:00:25,956
Nearly all revenue is shared equally.

7
00:00:26,156 --> 00:00:27,250
Result?

8
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:35,093
The Green Bay Packers— a city with a population of 105,000—generate
similar revenue to the New York Giants.

9
00:00:35,093 --> 00:00:37,896
Highest competitive parity in sports.

10
00:00:39,296 --> 00:00:42,438
Model 2: NHL—Moderate Sharing, 50% shared.

11
00:00:42,438 --> 00:00:47,024
National media rights, streaming, and merchandise are shared.

12
00:00:47,024 --> 00:00:50,760
Local media rights and ticket sales stay with teams.

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,327
Plus a revenue sharing pool for struggling teams.

14
00:00:54,527 --> 00:00:56,386
The complication?

15
00:00:56,586 --> 00:01:01,766
Canadian teams earn in Canadian dollars but pay
players in U.S. dollars.

16
00:01:01,766 --> 00:01:05,333
Currency fluctuations create major challenges.

17
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,130
Model 3: Premier League—Tiered Distribution.

18
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:17,349
TV revenue split three ways: 50% equal, 25% based on finishing
position, 25% based on TV appearances.

19
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:20,117
Rewards success while maintaining baseline competitiveness.

20
00:01:25,017 --> 00:01:32,908
Why this matters: Revenue sharing limits strategic
options, creates governance tensions, and affects team valuations.

21
00:01:32,908 --> 00:01:40,493
In the Vancouver Canucks case, you'll see how revenue sharing—and
currency headwinds—affect strategic decisions.
