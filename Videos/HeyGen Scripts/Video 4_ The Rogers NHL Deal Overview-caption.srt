1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,662
November 2013: Rogers Communications paid $5.2

2
00:00:04,662 --> 00:00:09,012
billion for exclusive Canadian NHL rights—12 years,
all platforms, all games.

3
00:00:09,012 --> 00:00:11,803
The largest sports media deal in Canadian history.

4
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:16,543
This deal presented a case study in media market disruption and
strategic challenges.

5
00:00:16,743 --> 00:00:18,996
Rogers' Three Strategic Goals:

6
00:00:19,396 --> 00:00:21,778
Goal 1: Defend cable subscribers.

7
00:00:21,978 --> 00:00:24,965
They believed NHL rights would prevent cord-cutting.

8
00:00:24,965 --> 00:00:30,613
Reality: Canadian traditional TV subscriptions declined significantly
during the contract period.

9
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:34,119
Hockey alone couldn't reverse the industry shift to streaming.

10
00:00:34,319 --> 00:00:36,767
Goal 2: Build streaming dominance.

11
00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:39,953
They projected 1+ million Sportsnet NOW subscribers.

12
00:00:40,453 --> 00:00:45,757
Reality: They reached only 450,000 by 2024—
 missing targets substantially every year.

13
00:00:45,957 --> 00:00:47,950
Goal 3: Brand positioning.

14
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,798
Become Canada's #1 sports network.

15
00:00:50,998 --> 00:00:57,341
Partial success: Sportsnet built brand equity,
though questions remained about profitability margins.

16
00:00:57,841 --> 00:01:03,295
Rogers' annual rights fees escalated from $300
million to $500 million across the contract period.

17
00:01:03,295 --> 00:01:08,133
The streaming platform did not generate sufficient offsetting revenue
from subscriptions and advertising.

18
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:12,707
COVID Impact: 2020-21 season cancellation created payment pressures.

19
00:01:12,707 --> 00:01:17,701
Rogers paid full rights fees while generating minimal live content
and had limited ability to renegotiate terms.

20
00:01:19,101 --> 00:01:23,679
Lessons learned: Content alone isn't enough—streaming experience and
platform architecture matter.

21
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:27,113
Long-term rights deals require flexibility clauses
for market disruptions.

22
00:01:27,113 --> 00:01:30,911
Media landscape disruption creates risks for
fixed-price, multi-year commitments.

23
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:37,253
In Week 2, you'll analyze this deal in depth and examine what Rogers'
strategic options are as the market evolves.
