# Rubric Design Workshop Example
## Revenue Ecosystem Reflection Memo Assessment

**Course:** Business of Sports Marketing (MBA)
**Week:** 1 - The Business of Sport: Where the Money Flows
**Assessment Type:** Summative (30 points)
**Format:** 1-page executive memo

---

## Course Context

This 5-week MBA course examines the business of sports marketing through an integrated revenue ecosystem lens. Week 1 introduces students to five major revenue streams (media rights, ticketing, sponsorship, merchandising, betting) and emphasizes how these streams interconnect rather than operate as independent silos.

**Module Learning Outcomes (MLOs) Assessed:**
- MLO 1.1: Analyze the unique characteristics of sport's business model
- MLO 1.2: Evaluate interdependencies across five major revenue streams
- MLO 1.3: Assess revenue sharing models and their strategic implications
- MLO 1.4: Apply revenue ecosystem thinking to investment decisions

**Bloom's Taxonomy Level:** Analysis

## Assessment Description

**Task:**
Write a 1-page executive memo advising a private equity firm (Brookfield Capital) considering investing $500M-$1B in acquiring a mid-market professional sports team.

**Business Context:**
The Managing Partner, Sarah Chen, has 15 years of private equity experience in traditional industries (hospitality, real estate, retail) but no sports industry knowledge. She needs to understand whether sports teams operate like other businesses—and if not, what makes them different.

**Memo Requirements:**
1. Explain the unique characteristics of sport's revenue model (200-250 words)
2. Analyze at least 3 revenue streams with growth potential and risks (150-200 words)
3. Identify 2-3 specific factors that would influence the investment decision (100-150 words)
4. Professional memo format (To/From/Date/Re) with executive tone
5. Maximum 500 words

**Audience:** Sophisticated investor unfamiliar with sports-specific business dynamics

**What Students Have Learned:**
- Interactive revenue mix simulation (8 widgets)
- NHL Vancouver Canucks case study (real financial data)
- Revenue sharing models comparison (NHL, NFL, EPL)
- Executive interview with Bell Media/TSN leader
- Formative AI Roleplay practice pitch

## Assessment Rubric (30 Points)

### Criterion 1: Revenue Stream Analysis (10 points)

**Description:**
Accurately describes and analyzes at least 3 revenue streams with understanding of interdependencies.

**Does not meet expectations (0-6 points):**
The learner analyzes fewer than 3 streams, provides minimal analysis, or treats streams as independent silos without showing interdependencies.

**Partially meets expectations (7-8 points):**
The learner analyzes 3 streams but may lack depth or miss some key interdependencies and unique characteristics.

**Fully meets expectations (9-10 points):**
The learner accurately describes and analyzes 3+ revenue streams, demonstrating clear understanding of interdependencies and unique characteristics of sport's revenue model.

---

The learner identifies 2-3 reasonable factors with some justification but may lack specificity or full support from course evidence.

**Fully meets expectations (9-10 points):**
The learner identifies 2-3 specific, defensible factors that would influence investment decision, clearly supported with evidence from course content.

---

### Criterion 3: Application of Concepts (5 points)

**Description:**
Effectively applies concepts from executive session, readings, and case study.

**Does not meet expectations (0-3 points):**
The learner makes minimal or no reference to course content, relying primarily on general business knowledge.

The learner effectively applies concepts from executive session, readings, and Canucks case, making relevant and specific connections.

---

### Criterion 4: Business Communication (5 points)

**Description:**
Professional memo format with clear, concise writing appropriate for executive audience.

**Does not meet expectations (0-3 points):**
The learner does not use memo format, exceeds word limit significantly, or uses unclear/unprofessional communication style.

## Rubric Examples with Sample Excerpts

### Revenue Stream Analysis - Excellent Example (9-10 points)

**What makes this excellent:**
Demonstrates sophisticated understanding of at least 3 revenue streams, explaining not just what they are but how they interconnect. Shows how media rights value depends on competitive talent, which requires revenue sharing to maintain balance.

**Sample Excerpt:**
> "Media rights generate 55% of NHL revenue, but this value depends entirely on competitive balance maintained through revenue sharing. Without sharing, wealthy teams would monopolize talent, creating predictable outcomes that decrease media value for all. The Canucks benefit from shared national media revenue ($XX million) but must compete for scarce local sponsorship dollars..."

**Key Strengths:**
- Analyzes 3+ revenue streams with specific percentages
- Explicitly connects interdependencies (media ↔ revenue sharing ↔ competitive balance)
- References course case study (Vancouver Canucks) with specific financial data
- Shows cause-and-effect understanding of ecosystem dynamics

---

### Investment Factors - Excellent Example (9-10 points)

**What makes this excellent:**
Identifies 2-3 specific, defensible investment factors supported by evidence. Factors show strategic thinking and business acumen.

**Sample Excerpt:**
> "Two factors would drive my investment decision: (1) Revenue sharing stability—leagues with proven revenue sharing models (like the NFL) protect downside risk, and (2) Emerging stream potential—teams with rights to betting partnerships and digital content can capture high-growth revenue outside traditional sharing pools."

**Key Strengths:**
- Specific, actionable factors (not generic like "market size" or "brand value")
- Evidence-based reasoning linking to course frameworks (NFL revenue sharing model)
- Strategic framing (downside protection + upside capture)
- Business sophistication appropriate for PE investment decision

---

### Application of Concepts - Excellent Example (5 points)

**What makes this excellent:**
Effectively applies concepts from executive session, readings, and Canucks case, making relevant and specific connections.

**Sample Excerpt:**
> "As the Bell Media executive emphasized in our session, appointment viewing creates media value—but the Canucks case shows this is vulnerable to cord-cutting trends. Their 22% decline in linear viewership (2019-2024) directly impacted local media revenue, demonstrating why diversification into betting and digital is critical for risk mitigation."

**Key Strengths:**
- References executive session content specifically
- Integrates case study data (22% decline, specific time period)
- Synthesizes multiple course materials into unified argument
- Demonstrates critical thinking beyond summarization

---

### Business Communication - Excellent Example (5 points)

**What makes this excellent:**
Professional memo format, clear and concise writing with appropriate tone for executive audience, stays within 500-word limit.

**Sample Excerpt:**
> **MEMORANDUM**
>
> **TO:** Sarah Chen, Managing Partner, Brookfield Capital
> **FROM:** [Student Name], Sports Business Consultant
> **DATE:** [Date]
> **RE:** Investment Recommendation - Professional Sports Team Acquisition
>
> You asked whether sports teams operate like traditional businesses. The short answer: no—and understanding why matters for your $500M-$1B investment decision...

**Key Strengths:**
- Proper memo format (To/From/Date/Re)
- Executive tone (direct, concise, no jargon without explanation)
- Conversational framing ("You asked...") appropriate for consultant-client relationship
- Tight writing (no filler language, every sentence serves a purpose)

## Design Rationale

**Why This Rubric Works:**

1. **Criterion Clarity:** Each criterion has specific, observable descriptors rather than vague terms like "good" or "excellent"

2. **Alignment to Learning Outcomes:** All four MLOs (1.1-1.4) are explicitly measured through the criteria

3. **Authentic Task:** Executive memo to PE firm mirrors real-world sports business consulting

4. **Scaffolded Support:** Students complete formative AI Roleplay practice pitch before writing memo

5. **Progressive Disclosure:** Rubric examples provided separately (optional Details accordion) so students aren't overwhelmed

6. **Sample Excerpts:** Concrete examples show students what quality looks like across criteria

**Assessment Design Challenges Addressed:**

- **Generic Business Language:** Criterion 1 explicitly requires sports-specific insights about interdependencies (prevents students from treating sports like any other business)

- **Surface-Level Application:** Criterion 3 rewards synthesis across multiple course materials (not just case study summarization)

- **Word Count Gaming:** Criterion 4 penalizes exceeding 500 words (teaches concision, prevents padding)

- **Memorization vs. Analysis:** Authentic scenario requires application and evaluation (Bloom's Analysis level), not recall

**Universal Design for Learning (UDL) Features:**

- Multiple means of engagement: Students practiced pitch in AI Roleplay before writing (reduces anxiety)
- Multiple means of representation: Rubric with sample excerpts shows quality examples
- Multiple means of action/expression: Memo format allows structure while requiring original thinking
- Optional AI Chat Widget: Writing support available but doesn't do work for students

## Notes for Workshop Discussion

**Questions This Rubric Raises:**

1. **Evaluation Levels:** This rubric uses a 3-level system (Does not meet/Partially meets/Fully meets). Would a 4-level or 5-level system be more useful?

2. **Point Distribution:** Is 10-10-5-5 appropriate, or should Business Communication criterion be weighted higher/lower?

3. **Sample Excerpts:** Are the provided examples too prescriptive, or do they helpfully clarify expectations?

4. **Assessment Integrity:** With AI tools available, does this memo task remain "AI-resistant" or should it be redesigned?

**Potential Improvements:**

- Add "Exceeds Expectations" level for aspirational performance?
- Split Criterion 1 into two separate criteria (Accuracy + Interdependencies)?
- Include intermediate feedback checkpoint (draft review before final submission)?
- Integrate peer review using structured protocol?
