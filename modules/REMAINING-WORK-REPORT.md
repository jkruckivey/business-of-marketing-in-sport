## Phase 4: Outstanding Issues from Student Journey Simulation

### High-Priority Fixes (Partially Complete)
âœ… **Replaced "Live Session" language** with "Recorded Video"
âœ… **Added prominent rubric links** before activities begin
âœ… **Recalibrated time estimates** (Week 1: 6-8 hrs, Week 2: 7-9 hrs)
âœ… **Added NHL Canucks case access notice** with warning
âœ… **Added Anchor Project preview** in Week 1 Module 7

### Remaining Issues (Not Yet Addressed)

#### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: Missing Primary Source Materials
**Problem:** NHL Canucks case study (W14149) requires Harvard Business Publishing license

**Options:**
1. **License Official Case** (~$8-15 per student)
   - Pros: Authentic, professionally written, exhibits included
   - Cons: Cost, licensing logistics, copyright restrictions
   - Timeline: 2-4 weeks for institutional license approval

2. **Write Custom Case** (12-20 hours)
   - Pros: Free, customizable, owned IP
   - Cons: Requires research, less credibility, may lack depth
   - Timeline: 1-2 weeks for research and writing

3. **Substitute Case** (4-6 hours research)
   - Pros: Existing free cases available (e.g., teaching cases from journals)
   - Cons: May not perfectly align with learning outcomes
   - Timeline: 1 week to find and adapt

**Recommendation:** Pursue Option 1 (license official case) if budget allows; otherwise Option 2 (custom case using public financial data from Canucks annual reports, NHL CBA documents).

#### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM: Limited Visual Content for Visual Learners
**Problem:** Sarah (visual learner persona) scored 72/100 due to text-heavy content with minimal visual scaffolding

**Solutions:**
- [ ] Add infographics for key concepts (5 drivers of rights valuation, fan engagement value chain)
- [ ] Create video explainers for complex frameworks (2-3 minutes each)
- [ ] Add data visualizations to case exhibits (charts for financial trends, viewership data)
- [ ] Consider animated widgets/simulations as learning content (not just practice)

**Estimated effort:** 6-10 hours (design + creation)

#### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM: Limited Collaborative Activities
**Problem:** Priya (collaborative leader) scored 68/100 due to isolation; discussion forums feel like afterthought

**Solutions:**
- [ ] Add structured discussion forum prompts for each module
- [ ] Create peer review protocol for reflection memos (Week 1) and mini-case memos (Week 2)
- [ ] Add synchronous optional discussion sessions (recorded for async students)
- [ ] Enhance Anchor Project with milestone check-ins and peer feedback

**Estimated effort:** 4-6 hours (design discussion activities + rubrics)

#### ðŸŸ¢ LOW: Missing Data Sources and Methodology
**Problem:** Marcus (analytical thinker) scored 85/100 but frustrated by undefined methodology and missing sources

**Solutions:**
- [ ] Add "Data Sources & Methodology" Details accordion to each module
- [ ] Include references and citations in all readings
- [ ] Provide raw data files (CSV/Excel) for case studies
- [ ] Add "Further Reading" sections with academic articles and industry reports

**Estimated effort:** 3-4 hours (compile sources and write methodology notes)

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Items (Could delay launch)

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Executive guest unavailable** | No video content for Modules 2 | Book 2 backup executives; have backup plan (use pre-recorded industry conference talk) |
| **Case licensing delays** | Missing core Week 1 assessment | Pursue custom case option in parallel; have substitute case identified |
| **Widget development bugs** | Students can't complete activities | Build widgets early (Week 1-2); extensive testing; have low-tech alternative (PDF worksheets) |
| **AI Chat widget limitations** | Poor student experience, academic integrity concerns | Write detailed system prompts; test extensively; monitor usage logs; disable if problematic |
| **Accessibility compliance failures** | Legal risk, excludes students with disabilities | Use accessibility-auditor subagent early; hire specialist; budget extra time for fixes |

### Medium-Risk Items (Could reduce quality)

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Time estimate overruns** | Student complaints, low completion rates | Conservative estimates (already inflated); provide time management guidance; make more content optional |
| **Visual content gaps** | Visual learners struggle (Sarah persona 72/100) | Prioritize fan engagement diagram; add charts to case exhibits; use stock graphics if custom design unavailable |
| **Limited collaboration opportunities** | Collaborative learners disengaged (Priya 68/100) | Add discussion forum prompts; create peer review protocol; emphasize Anchor Project teamwork |

---

## Priority Recommendations

### Must-Have for Launch (MVP)

1. **All core readings and case studies** (Modules 3, 5 for both weeks)
2. **Assessment rubrics and submission portals** (Module 6 for both weeks)
3. **At least 2 of 4 custom widgets** (Revenue Empire Builder, Streaming Wars Strategy)
4. **VTT captions for all videos** (accessibility requirement)
5. **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance** (legal requirement)

### Should-Have for Quality Experience

1. **All 4 custom widgets fully functional**
2. **Executive video sessions recorded**
3. **Visual diagrams for key concepts** (fan engagement value chain, revenue flow)
4. **AI Chat widgets configured with tested prompts**
5. **Peer review and student pilot feedback incorporated**

### Nice-to-Have for Enhanced Experience

1. **Licensed Harvard case** (vs. custom case)
2. **Additional infographics and visual scaffolding**
3. **Structured discussion forum activities**
4. **Data sources and methodology Details accordions**
5. **Animated explainer videos for complex frameworks**

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This week)
1. **Decide case licensing strategy** (official vs. custom) - affects budget and timeline
2. **Book executive guests** for video sessions (2-4 week lead time typical)
3. **Assign content creation roles** (writer, developer, designer)
4. **Set up development infrastructure** (GitHub repo for widgets, Google Drive for drafts)

### Week 1 Priorities
1. **Draft all text documents** (week1-intro, week1-revenue-streams, week1-canucks-case)
2. **Start Revenue Empire Builder widget development** (highest complexity)
3. **Create fan engagement value chain diagram** (needed for Week 2 Module 3)
4. **Finalize executive guest and schedule recording** (90-minute session)

### Week 2 Priorities
1. **Record Week 1 executive session** (if guest confirmed)
2. **Continue widget development** (Streaming Wars Strategy, Property Selector, Team Charter)
3. **Begin Uplimit platform build for Week 1** (import completed text documents)
4. **Create visual assets** (diagrams, thumbnails)

---

## Conclusion

The storyboards are **pedagogically sound and ready for content creation**. The remaining work is significant but well-defined:

- **Content creation:** 40-60 hours per week (text, video, widgets, images)
- **Platform build:** 15-25 hours per week (Uplimit configuration, testing)
- **Quality assurance:** 10-15 hours per week (accessibility, functional testing, student experience)

**Total estimated effort:** 65-100 hours per week Ã— 2 weeks = **130-200 hours**

With dedicated resources and parallel development tracks, both weeks can be launch-ready in **6 weeks**.

The **highest-priority decision** is the NHL Canucks case licensing strategy, as this affects budget, timeline, and Week 1 assessment quality. Recommend pursuing official case licensing while developing custom case as backup.

All UDL principles, QM standards, and accessibility requirements have been designed into the storyboards. The badge system (ðŸ”´ Required, ðŸŸ¡ Recommended, ðŸŸ¢ Optional) will help time-constrained students prioritize effectively, addressing the #1 pain point identified in student journey simulation.
