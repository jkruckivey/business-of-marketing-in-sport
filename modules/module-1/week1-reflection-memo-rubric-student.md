## Assessment Criteria

### Criterion 1: Revenue Stream Analysis (30 points)

**What we're looking for:** Identification and thorough analysis of the most vulnerable revenue stream

| Performance Level | Description | Self-Check ‚úì |
|------------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Exemplary (27-30 pts)** | Identifies specific revenue stream with compelling evidence from *both* Canucks case AND TSN executive video. Analysis includes 3+ vulnerability factors (market trends, technology disruption, consumer behavior). Uses specific data/examples. | Did I cite specific dollar amounts or percentages? Did I reference both the case AND the executive video? |
| **Proficient (24-26 pts)** | Clearly identifies vulnerable stream with evidence from case OR video. Discusses 2-3 vulnerability factors with reasonable support. | Did I explain WHY this stream is vulnerable with concrete examples? |
| **Developing (21-23 pts)** | Identifies stream but analysis is general. Limited evidence or vague vulnerability factors. May rely on opinion without support. | Did I provide specific reasons beyond "it seems risky"? |
| **Beginning (18-20 pts)** | Identifies stream but minimal analysis. No clear connection to case/video content. | Did I actually analyze vulnerability or just state an opinion? |
| **Missing (0-17 pts)** | No clear identification or analysis is absent/incorrect. | |

**Success Tip:** Use the risk/opportunity matrix from your pre-session work as a foundation!

### Criterion 2: TSN Executive Integration (25 points)

**What we're looking for:** Incorporation of insights from Bell Media/TSN executive video

| Performance Level | Description | Self-Check ‚úì |
|------------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Exemplary (23-25 pts)** | Seamlessly integrates 3+ specific insights from TSN executive. Directly quotes or paraphrases executive commentary. Shows how media rights holder perspective validates your argument. | Did I reference specific quotes or points the executive made? |
| **Proficient (20-22 pts)** | Integrates 2 specific insights from video. Clearly connects executive perspective to your analysis. | Did I explain HOW the executive's view supports my argument? |
| **Developing (18-19 pts)** | Mentions executive video but integration is superficial. Generic references without specific insights. | Did I actually use content FROM the video or just mention it? |
| **Beginning (15-17 pts)** | Minimal or no integration of executive insights. | Did I watch the full executive video? |
| **Missing (0-14 pts)** | No reference to executive video content. | |

**Success Tip:** Take notes during the video! Timestamp key quotes for easy reference.

### Criterion 3: Canucks Case Application (25 points)

**What we're looking for:** Application of NHL Vancouver Canucks case analysis (HBS W14149)

| Performance Level | Description | Self-Check ‚úì |
|------------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Exemplary (23-25 pts)** | Uses Canucks case as primary evidence. Cites specific case details (revenue figures, market conditions, competitive context). Applies revenue sharing implications to vulnerability analysis. | Did I reference specific pages or exhibits from the case? |
| **Proficient (20-22 pts)** | Applies 2-3 specific elements from Canucks case. Clear connection between case context and vulnerability argument. | Did I show HOW the Canucks situation illustrates my point? |
| **Developing (18-19 pts)** | Mentions Canucks case but application is general. Limited case-specific details. | Did I use actual case data or just mention "the Canucks"? |
| **Beginning (15-17 pts)** | Minimal case application or incorrect case interpretation. | Did I actually read the case thoroughly? |
| **Missing (0-14 pts)** | No use of case analysis. | |

**Success Tip:** The case prep questions you completed are gold - review your answers!

‚ùå **Forgetting integration:** Writing case analysis without connecting to executive insights

‚ùå **Exceeding page limit:** If you go to page 2, you lose professionalism points
