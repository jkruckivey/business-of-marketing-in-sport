# Rogers Communications: The $5.2 Billion NHL Rights Deal

## Case Background

### Company Overview: Rogers Communications Inc.

Rogers Communications stands as one of Canada's largest telecommunications and media conglomerates, with 2013 annual revenues of $12.9 billion and approximately 26,000 employees. The company operates across three primary divisions:

**Wireless:** Rogers' largest revenue driver, providing mobile phone service to 9.4 million Canadian subscribers (2013). The wireless division generates ~$7.5 billion annually and represents the company's most profitable segment.

**Cable:** Rogers Cable serves 2.3 million residential and business customers with internet, television, and landline phone service, primarily in Ontario and New Brunswick. Annual revenue: ~$3.4 billion. This division faces structural headwinds from cord-cutting and competitive pressure from Bell and Telus.

**Media:** Rogers Media owns television networks (Sportsnet, Citytv, OMNI), radio stations (680 News, KISS 92.5, others), print publications (Maclean's magazine, formerly numerous daily newspapers), and sports franchises (Toronto Blue Jays baseball). Annual revenue: ~$2 billion.

Rogers' media division had historically been the company's smallest and least profitable, often viewed as a strategic defensive position rather than a growth engine. Cable and wireless drove the business, while media provided bundling opportunities and brand visibility.

### The Rogers Family and Corporate Control

Rogers Communications was founded by Ted Rogers in 1960 as a single radio station (CHFI-FM in Toronto). Ted Rogers built the company through aggressive acquisitions and early bets on cable television and wireless communications. He died in 2008, leaving controlling interest to the Rogers family through a dual-class share structure that gave the family voting control despite owning a minority economic stake.

In 2013, the company was led by:
- **Nadir Mohamed:** President & CEO (non-family member, professional manager)
- **Edward Rogers III:** Vice-Chair, son of Ted Rogers, representing family interests on the board
- **Keith Pelley:** President of Rogers Media (former TSN executive, recruited 2011 to revitalize sports strategy)

This leadership structure created tension between professional management (Mohamed) focused on financial discipline and family interests (Edward Rogers) willing to make bold strategic bets aligned with Ted Rogers' legacy of visionary risk-taking.

### Canadian Sports Media Landscape (2013)

The Canadian sports broadcasting market was dominated by two players locked in intense competition:

**TSN (The Sports Network) - Owned by Bell Media:**
- Canada's first 24/7 sports network, launched 1984
- Market leader in sports broadcasting for nearly three decades
- Held regional NHL rights for Toronto Maple Leafs, Ottawa Senators, Winnipeg Jets, Montreal Canadiens
- Strong position in other sports: CFL football, FIFA World Cup, curling, tennis
- Brand tagline: "Canada's Sports Leader"
- Estimated value of sports rights portfolio: ~$250 million annually

**Sportsnet - Owned by Rogers Media:**
- Launched 1998 as regional sports network
- Held regional NHL rights for Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers, Vancouver Canucks, Toronto Maple Leafs (shared with TSN)
- Secondary position to TSN in viewer perception and ratings
- Attempting to challenge TSN's dominance but lacked signature national property
- Estimated value of sports rights portfolio: ~$180 million annually

**CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation):**
- Public broadcaster with legendary *Hockey Night in Canada* Saturday broadcast dating to 1952
- Held NHL national rights through 2014, but relationship with NHL strained over revenue sharing
- CBC's model: Free over-the-air broadcast, advertising-supported, no rights fees paid to NHL (revenue-sharing arrangement instead)
- Facing government budget cuts and pressure to reduce reliance on sports programming

The competitive dynamic in 2013: TSN was the established leader, Sportsnet was the aggressive challenger, and CBC's future with hockey was uncertain as the NHL sought to monetize rights more aggressively.

### The NHL's Strategic Context

The National Hockey League entered 2013 with mixed momentum:

**Strengths:**
- Solidifying position as North America's #4 major professional league (after NFL, MLB, NBA)
- Canadian market deeply passionate about hockey—cultural obsession, not just sports fandom
- U.S. rights deals growing: NBC paying $200 million/year for U.S. national rights (2011-2021 deal)
- Revenue sharing and salary cap (post-2004-05 lockout) creating competitive balance

**Challenges:**
- Just emerging from 2012-13 lockout (season shortened to 48 games, significant fan backlash)
- U.S. sunbelt expansion teams (Phoenix, Florida, Carolina) struggling financially
- Canadian dollar strength (at par with USD in 2013) masking underlying revenue vulnerabilities
- Media landscape shifting: cord-cutting accelerating, streaming platforms emerging, traditional broadcast model uncertain

The NHL needed to maximize Canadian rights revenue—both to demonstrate league value to U.S. media partners (up for renewal in 2020s) and to stabilize struggling franchises through revenue sharing. Canada represented ~33% of NHL revenue despite having only 7 of 30 teams (23%).

### The Expiring Rights Agreement

The existing Canadian broadcast rights deal (2007-2014) was a patchwork:

- **CBC:** National Saturday night games (*Hockey Night in Canada*), playoffs, Stanley Cup Final. Revenue-sharing model, no direct rights fee. CBC kept advertising revenue, NHL received sponsorship and lower-tier broadcast windows.

- **TSN/RDS (Bell Media):** Regional rights for 4 teams + national cable games (weeknights). Approximately $100 million annually.

- **Sportsnet (Rogers):** Regional rights for 3 teams + some national cable games. Approximately $80 million annually.

**Total annual value to NHL:** ~$180-200 million (combination of direct fees and revenue shares)

The NHL's 2013 goal: Double or triple this value by consolidating rights with a single national broadcaster willing to pay premium fees for exclusivity. Industry speculation suggested the league sought $300-400 million annually—an aggressive target that would require one broadcaster making a transformational bet.

## The Deal

### The Negotiation Process (Spring-Fall 2013)

The NHL formally began the Canadian rights negotiation process in March 2013, shortly after the 2012-13 lockout ended. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman and Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly made clear the league's preferences:

**NHL Priorities:**
1. **Exclusivity:** Single national broadcaster to maximize per-broadcaster commitment and simplify league relationships
2. **Rights Fee Guarantee:** Move away from CBC's revenue-sharing model to guaranteed annual payments insulated from advertising market fluctuations
3. **Multi-platform Rights:** Include television, radio, digital streaming, mobile—all delivery platforms under one deal
4. **Long-term Certainty:** 10+ year deal to provide revenue predictability and align with U.S. rights cycles

**Bidding Parties:**
- **Rogers Communications / Sportsnet:** Aggressive challenger positioning
- **Bell Media / TSN:** Incumbent defender with most to lose
- **CBC:** Limited financial capacity due to government budget constraints, exploring partnership models
- **Quebecor / TVA Sports:** Quebec-focused regional bidder, limited national scale

The negotiation unfolded over six months with multiple bidding rounds. Industry observers expected Bell/TSN to win given their market leadership position and deeper pockets (Bell's $20+ billion annual revenue dwarfed Rogers' media division). Rogers was seen as a credible bidder but likely to be outbid.

### The Surprise Announcement (November 26, 2013)

On November 26, 2013, the NHL and Rogers stunned the sports media industry with a transformational announcement:

**Rogers Communications has acquired exclusive Canadian multimedia rights to the National Hockey League for 12 years (2014-2026) for $5.232 billion.**

**Deal Terms:**
- **Total Value:** $5.232 billion CAD
- **Annual Average:** $436 million CAD (~$410 million USD at 2013 exchange rates)
- **Term:** 12 years (2014-15 season through 2025-26 season)
- **Platforms:** All platforms—broadcast television, cable, satellite, radio, digital streaming, mobile, future technologies
- **Content:** All regular season games (national and regional), all playoff games, Stanley Cup Final, All-Star Game, Draft, outdoor games
- **Languages:** English-language and French-language rights (Sportsnet + TVA Sports sublicense)
- **Exclusivity:** Complete exclusivity—no other Canadian broadcaster could air NHL games

**What Rogers Acquired:**
- National rights to all games across Canada (replacing CBC's *Hockey Night in Canada* role)
- Regional rights for all seven Canadian teams (Maple Leafs, Canadiens, Senators, Jets, Flames, Oilers, Canucks)
- Digital streaming rights for authenticated cable/satellite subscribers
- Mobile rights for highlights and condensed games
- Radio broadcast rights
- International rights for Canadian content (e.g., Canadian teams' games broadcast globally)

**What Rogers Planned to Do:**
- Rebrand all NHL coverage under "Rogers NHL" umbrella
- Maintain *Hockey Night in Canada* Saturday tradition in partnership with CBC (sublicensing broadcast signal to CBC for free over-the-air distribution)
- Launch "Sportsnet NOW" streaming service for authenticated subscribers
- Create 24/7 NHL content across Sportsnet, Sportsnet ONE, Sportsnet 360 cable channels
- Integrate NHL content across Rogers' platforms (wireless app exclusive content, magazine coverage)

### Industry Reaction

The announcement sent shockwaves through Canadian media and business communities:

**Supporters (Bulls on the Deal):**
- **Rogers executives:** "This is a transformational acquisition that positions Rogers as Canada's home of hockey for the next generation."
- **NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman:** "This deal reflects the extraordinary passion for hockey in Canada and establishes a new benchmark for sports rights globally."
- **Media analysts (positive view):** "Rogers is making a strategic bet that exclusive NHL rights will be the essential content that prevents cord-cutting. If hockey truly is Canada's obsession, this could prove brilliant."
- **Rogers shareholders (some):** "The deal provides long-term content certainty and differentiates Rogers from Bell in the Canadian market. Over 12 years, the annual cost is manageable."

**Critics (Bears on the Deal):**
- **Media analysts (negative view):** "Rogers is paying 2.5x the previous rights value in a cord-cutting environment. The economics don't work unless Rogers can monetize hockey in unprecedented ways."
- **Bell Media executives:** "We're comfortable walking away at this price. The market fundamentals don't support this valuation."
- **Rogers shareholders (some):** "This is a reckless bet-the-company decision. If cord-cutting accelerates, Rogers will be locked into crippling annual payments with no way out."
- **Industry observers:** "Rogers is overpaying for a declining asset (linear television) in a transition period to streaming. By 2020, nobody will be watching hockey on cable."

Rogers' stock price dropped 4.2% in the two trading days following the announcement, reflecting investor skepticism about the valuation and strategic risk.

### Why Rogers Won the Bidding

Multiple factors explain why Rogers prevailed over financially stronger Bell Media:

**1. Willingness to Overpay:** Rogers bid significantly beyond Bell's walk-away price. Industry estimates suggest Bell's final offer was ~$350-375 million annually. Rogers' $436 million annual bid represented a 15-20% premium over Bell's ceiling.

**2. Strategic Desperation:** For Bell Media, losing NHL rights would be painful but survivable—TSN had strong portfolio diversification (CFL, NBA, FIFA, tennis, curling). For Rogers Media, losing NHL rights would be existential—Sportsnet's entire brand identity was built on regional hockey. Rogers needed this more.

**3. Family Control:** Rogers' dual-class share structure allowed the Rogers family to override professional management's financial discipline. Edward Rogers III championed the deal as honoring his father's legacy of bold bets. Public company constraints (quarterly earnings pressure) weighed less heavily.

**4. Bundling Strategy:** Rogers' integrated telecom model (cable + wireless + media) created strategic rationale that pure media companies lacked. Rogers could leverage NHL content across platforms: exclusive mobile highlights for wireless subscribers, authenticated streaming for cable subscribers, bundled pricing across services. This cross-platform synergy justified higher bid.

**5. Exclusivity Value:** Rogers believed exclusive rights (vs. split regional/national rights) would create "all or nothing" subscriber dynamics. Cable subscribers couldn't get Maple Leafs on TSN and Canadiens on Sportsnet—everything was Sportsnet. This concentrated market power.

## Rogers' Strategic Rationale

### The Public Justification (November 2013 Investor Presentation)

Rogers management presented four strategic pillars justifying the $5.2B investment:

**Pillar 1: Defend the Cable Business**

Rogers projected the NHL rights would slow cable subscriber attrition by 150,000-200,000 subscribers annually—customers who would cut the cord to save $80-100/month but would maintain service to access hockey.

**Math:**
- 200,000 retained subscribers × $90/month average cable revenue = $216 million annual defended revenue
- Over 12 years: $2.6 billion in cumulative retained cable revenue
- Additional benefit: Retained cable subscribers often maintain Rogers internet and wireless service (bundle loyalty)

This defensive revenue exceeded the $436 million annual rights fee in Rogers' projections, making the deal "profitable" when accounting for subscriber retention.

**Pillar 2: Advertising Revenue Growth**

Rogers projected advertising revenue would grow from historical ~$180 million annually to $300+ million annually by Year 5, driven by:
- Premium pricing for exclusive national NHL coverage (CPM increase from $30 to $50+)
- Increased inventory volume (more games across more networks)
- Sponsorship integration opportunities (betting partnerships, in-game branded content)
- Playoff advertising surge (higher ratings = higher rates)

**Math:**
- Incremental advertising revenue: +$120 million annually at maturity
- Over 12 years: $1.2 billion in cumulative incremental ad revenue

**Pillar 3: Streaming Platform Foundation**

Rogers planned to launch "Sportsnet NOW" as an authenticated streaming service (2016) and eventual direct-to-consumer standalone product (projected 2020). NHL content would serve as the foundation:

- Authenticated streaming: Cable subscribers could watch on any device, improving retention
- Standalone DTC: $25/month × 500,000 subscribers (Year 5 projection) = $150 million annual subscription revenue
- Data collection: Streaming viewers generate behavioral data valuable for targeted advertising and personalization

Rogers believed by 2025, streaming could generate $200-300 million in incremental annual revenue, offsetting cable decline.

**Pillar 4: Brand Repositioning and Cross-Platform Synergy**

Owning exclusive NHL rights would elevate Rogers' brand from "cable company" to "Canada's home of hockey"—a cultural asset alignment comparable to CBC's historical position.

Cross-platform benefits:
- **Wireless:** Exclusive mobile NHL highlights app for Rogers wireless subscribers (competitive advantage vs. Bell/Telus)
- **Magazine:** *Sportsnet Magazine* becomes definitive NHL publication
- **Radio:** Sportsnet 590/FAN 960 radio stations gain exclusive NHL audio rights
- **Community:** Rogers becomes entrenched in Canadian cultural identity

While harder to quantify financially, Rogers executives argued brand halo effects would drive customer acquisition and retention across all business units.

### The Private Calculation (Internal Assumptions)

Beyond the public investor presentation, Rogers' internal business case relied on several critical assumptions that proved overly optimistic:

**Assumption 1: Cord-Cutting Would Stabilize by 2018**

Rogers projected Canadian cable/satellite subscribers would decline from 11.2 million (2013) to 10.5 million (2018), then stabilize through 2026—a total 6% decline over 12 years.

**Actual:** Cable/satellite subscribers declined from 11.2M (2013) to 8.1M (2024)—a 28% decline. Cord-cutting accelerated far faster than Rogers anticipated, particularly 2016-2020.

**Assumption 2: Sports Would Be Immune to Cord-Cutting**

Rogers believed hockey fans specifically would maintain cable subscriptions regardless of cost because no other legal streaming alternative existed. "If you want hockey, you need cable" was the strategic logic.

**Actual:** Illegal streaming proliferated (NHLStreams subreddit, international VPN workarounds). Younger fans (18-34) increasingly consumed highlights and social media clips rather than full games. The "must-have" cable assumption eroded faster than expected.

**Assumption 3: Canadian Dollar Would Remain Near Parity with USD**

In 2013, 1 CAD = 0.95 USD. Rogers' NHL contract was denominated in CAD, and the company projected exchange rate stability.

**Actual:** The Canadian dollar weakened significantly: 1 CAD = 0.75 USD (2015-2020 average). This didn't directly impact the NHL contract but affected Rogers' overall business (imported technology costs, competitive pressure from U.S. streaming services pricing in USD).

**Assumption 4: Streaming Transition Would Be Monetized Successfully**

Rogers projected Sportsnet NOW would achieve 1 million subscribers by 2020 at $25/month average revenue.

**Actual:** Sportsnet NOW reached ~450,000 subscribers by 2024 at $28/month—less than half the projected scale. Subscriber acquisition costs exceeded projections, and churn rates (30-40% annually) made customer lifetime value lower than expected.

**Assumption 5: No Black Swan Events Would Disrupt Revenue**

Rogers' financial model assumed normal NHL seasons (82 games) every year from 2014-2026.

**Actual:** The 2019-20 season was suspended (COVID-19) and completed in summer 2020 with no fans. The 2020-21 season was shortened to 56 games, played in empty arenas with Canadian teams restricted to North Division (no U.S. travel). These two seasons devastated advertising revenue (no crowds = reduced atmosphere = lower viewership) with no contractual relief from NHL rights fees.

## Implementation and Performance (2014-2024)

### Year 1-2 (2014-2016): The Honeymoon Phase

**Successes:**
- Rogers successfully launched unified NHL coverage across Sportsnet networks
- *Hockey Night in Canada* maintained brand continuity through CBC partnership (free over-the-air sublicense)
- Playoff coverage 2015 delivered strong ratings (Maple Leafs' absence meant smaller audiences, but quality teams drove interest)
- Initial subscriber retention metrics positive: ~180,000 customers cited NHL access as reason for maintaining cable service

**Challenges:**
- Advertising revenue grew slower than projected: $200 million (Year 1) vs. projected $225 million
- Production costs exceeded budget due to technical infrastructure investment
- Viewer complaints about excessive commercial breaks and inferior broadcast quality vs. CBC legacy
- French-language sublicense to TVA Sports (Quebec market) underperformed due to Canadiens' mediocre performance

**Financial Performance:**
- Year 1 Operating Loss: ~$150 million (revenue $280M, costs $430M = rights fee + production)
- Year 2 Operating Loss: ~$130 million (revenue $300M, costs $430M)

Rogers executives reassured investors: "We're in investment phase. Year 5 breakeven on track."

### Year 3-4 (2016-2018): Cord-Cutting Acceleration

**Market Shifts:**
- Netflix subscriber growth exploded in Canada: 5.5M (2015) → 7.8M (2018)
- YouTube and social media became primary sports content consumption for viewers under 25
- Bell Media launched CraveTV streaming, competing for entertainment dollars
- Rogers' cable subscribers declined faster than projected: -8% annually vs. projected -2%

**Rogers' Response:**
- Launched Sportsnet NOW authenticated streaming (2016): Cable subscribers could watch anywhere
- Reduced shoulder programming production costs to preserve profitability
- Increased advertising inventory (more commercial breaks) to hit revenue targets—viewer backlash
- Experimented with digital-first content (YouTube highlights, mobile-exclusive features)

**Financial Performance:**
- Year 3 Operating Loss: ~$110 million
- Year 4 Operating Loss: ~$95 million
- Cumulative losses (4 years): ~$485 million

Positive trajectory, but still not profitable. Rogers' investor presentations emphasized "long-term strategic value" and "cable subscriber retention" rather than standalone profitability.

### Year 5-6 (2018-2020): Structural Doubt

**Market Realities:**
- Canadian cable/satellite subscribers: 9.2M (2018)—decline accelerating, not stabilizing
- Younger demographics abandoning traditional TV: 18-34 viewership down 35% from 2014 baseline
- Illegal streaming becoming normalized: NHLStreams subreddit had 400K+ users before shutdown
- Sports betting legalization discussions (Ontario 2019-2020) creating new monetization possibilities but not yet actionable

**Rogers' Strategic Pivot:**
- Reduced rights fee willingness in other sports: walked away from NBA rights renewal (won by TSN)
- Focused Sportsnet NOW marketing on standalone subscribers (not just cable authentication)
- Explored betting partnerships proactively (talks with DraftKings, FanDuel, theScore)
- Cut production quality to reduce costs (fewer cameras, smaller crews, consolidated studios)

**Financial Performance:**
- Year 5 Operating Loss: ~$85 million (closest to breakeven yet)
- Year 6 Operating Loss: ~$230 million **← COVID-19 impact**

### Year 7 (2020-21): The COVID Disaster

The 2020-21 NHL season represented catastrophic scenario Rogers never modeled:

**Impact:**
- Season delayed to January 2021, shortened to 56 games (vs. normal 82)
- All games played in empty arenas (no crowd energy, reduced broadcast appeal)
- Canadian teams restricted to "North Division" (no Canadian vs. U.S. matchups)
- Playoff viewership down 25% year-over-year due to pandemic fatigue
- Advertising revenue collapsed: Sponsors reduced commitments, CPM rates fell 40%

**Financial Outcome:**
- Advertising revenue: $200 million (vs. normal $320 million) = -$120 million shortfall
- Rights fee: $433 million (unchanged—no force majeure clause in contract)
- Total Year 7 Loss: ~$230 million

Rogers attempted to renegotiate COVID relief with the NHL. The league declined, pointing to contractual obligations and noting other broadcasters (NBC in U.S.) also faced losses without seeking relief.

**Cumulative Losses (7 years):** ~$920 million

Investor pressure mounted. Rogers' stock price fell 18% in 2020-21, partially attributable to NHL deal performance concerns.

### Year 8-10 (2021-2024): The Reckoning

**Post-COVID Recovery:**
- 2021-22 season returned to normal 82-game schedule with fans in arenas
- Advertising revenue rebounded to $350 million (stronger than pre-COVID due to betting integration)
- Sportsnet NOW standalone subscribers reached 450K (2024)—generating $150M annual subscription revenue
- Sports betting partnerships with BET365, FanDuel launched (2022)—generating ~$25M annually in data licensing and sponsorship

**But Structural Problems Persisted:**
- Cable subscribers continued declining: 8.1M (2024) vs. 11.2M (2013) = -28%
- Linear television viewership for regular season games down 22% from 2014 baseline
- Younger demographics (18-34) almost entirely consuming highlights/social clips vs. full games
- Production cost savings maxed out—quality deterioration risked further viewer erosion

**2024 Financial Performance:**
- Revenue: ~$380 million (ads $250M, Sportsnet NOW subs $130M)
- Costs: ~$433 million (rights fee + reduced production)
- Operating Loss: ~$53 million

After 10 years, the deal remains unprofitable on a standalone basis.

**Cumulative Operating Losses (10 years, 2014-2024):** Approximately $1.1 billion

## The Verdict: 10 Years Later

### Financial Scorecard (Standalone Basis)

**Total Revenue (2014-2024):** ~$3.2 billion
- Advertising: $2.5 billion
- Sportsnet NOW subscriptions: $700 million

**Total Costs (2014-2024):** ~$4.3 billion
- NHL rights fees: $4.33 billion ($433M × 10 years)
- Production/operations: minimal net cost after revenue offsets

**Net Operating Loss (10 years):** ~$1.1 billion

On a purely standalone financial basis, the deal has been a disaster. Rogers has lost over $1 billion in cumulative operating income, with no path to recovering these losses in the final 2 years (2024-26).

### Strategic Scorecard (Defensive Value)

Rogers argues the deal's true value lies in defended cable revenue:

**Subscriber Retention Analysis:**
- Rogers Cable subscribers (2013): 2.35 million
- Rogers Cable subscribers (2024): 1.82 million
- Decline: -530,000 subscribers (-23%)

**Industry Comparison:**
- Bell Fibe TV (competitor) decline 2013-2024: -31%
- Shaw Cable (Western Canada) decline: -35%
- Canadian industry average decline: -28%

Rogers experienced 5 percentage points less subscriber loss than industry average. If NHL rights contributed to this defensive performance, Rogers retained approximately 125,000 subscribers who otherwise would have churned.

**Defended Revenue Calculation:**
- 125,000 subscribers × $95/month average cable revenue × 12 months = $142 million/year
- Over 10 years: ~$1.42 billion in defended cable revenue
- Plus bundled wireless/internet retention benefits (harder to quantify)

**Strategic Verdict:** If Rogers' subscriber retention outperformance is attributable to NHL exclusivity (debatable), the deal approximately breaks even when combining operating losses (-$1.1B) with defended cable revenue (+$1.4B).

But this assumes causation (NHL rights caused better retention) vs. correlation (other factors like service quality, network investments, pricing drove better retention). Isolating NHL's specific contribution is analytically impossible.

### Brand and Positioning Scorecard

**Successes:**
- Sportsnet firmly established as "Canada's home of hockey" in public perception (2024 brand surveys show 68% associate Sportsnet with NHL vs. 22% CBC legacy association)
- *Hockey Night in Canada* brand successfully transitioned from CBC to Rogers stewardship
- Rogers wireless brand benefited from exclusive mobile NHL content (measured in customer acquisition surveys)

**Failures:**
- Viewer complaints about broadcast quality degradation vs. CBC "golden age"
- Perception that Rogers commercialized hockey excessively (more ads, less storytelling)
- Regional fan frustration that "national" coverage favored Toronto Maple Leafs disproportionately

### Lessons Learned

**What Rogers Got Right:**
1. **Exclusivity has value:** Owning all NHL rights created brand identification and prevented competitor differentiation
2. **Bundling synergies exist:** Cross-platform integration (wireless, cable, streaming) created value Bell Media couldn't replicate
3. **Betting integration potential:** Sports betting legalization (2021-2022) created unanticipated monetization—Rogers positioned well

**What Rogers Got Wrong:**
1. **Overestimated cable resilience:** Cord-cutting accelerated far faster than 2013 projections, undermining core business case
2. **Underestimated streaming complexity:** Building profitable DTC streaming proved harder and slower than projected (450K subscribers vs. 1M target)
3. **No flexibility for black swans:** COVID-19 devastated Year 7 revenue with no contractual relief—$230M loss could have been mitigated with force majeure clause
4. **Overpaid for declining asset:** Linear television was already in structural decline in 2013; Rogers paid 2.5x previous deal for contracting distribution medium

**The Fundamental Question:**
Did Rogers have a choice? If Bell Media had won exclusive NHL rights, would Sportsnet have survived as a viable sports network? Possibly not. Sometimes the "least bad" option is overpaying for essential strategic assets—because the alternative (losing them to competitors) is existential.

## Questions for Discussion

### Strategic Analysis Questions

1. **Valuation Framework:** Using the media rights valuation framework from Week 2 readings, evaluate Rogers' $5.2B bid. Which of the five valuation drivers (audience, exclusivity, content volume, brand alignment, platform fit) did Rogers weight most heavily? Were their assumptions reasonable in 2013?

2. **Platform Strategy:** Compare Rogers' platform strategy (integrated cable + streaming) to pure streaming competitors (DAZN, eventually). What advantages did Rogers' dual distribution model provide? What constraints did it create?

3. **Defensive vs. Offensive Value:** How much of the deal's value was defensive (retaining cable subscribers) vs. offensive (acquiring new customers, building streaming business)? Can you quantify the split?

4. **Black Swan Risk:** Should Rogers have negotiated force majeure provisions for scenarios like COVID-19? How would you price that optionality? What would the NHL have demanded in exchange?

### Comparative Questions

5. **Bell's Decision:** Bell Media bid ~$350-375M annually and walked away when Rogers bid $436M. Was Bell correct to stop bidding? What would Bell's position be today if they had won at $400M/year?

6. **Industry Benchmarking:** Compare the Rogers/NHL deal economics to other major sports rights deals:
   - NBC's NFL Sunday Night Football: $1B/year for 1 game per week (high CPM, massive audience)
   - Amazon's NFL Thursday Night Football: $1B/year for 1 game per week (streaming, subscriber acquisition focus)
   - Apple's MLS Season Pass: Undisclosed but estimated $250M/year (brand positioning, ecosystem lock-in)

   How do these comparisons inform your evaluation of Rogers' $436M/year for all NHL Canadian rights?

### Scenario Planning Questions

7. **The 2026 Decision:** Rogers' deal expires after the 2025-26 season. Put yourself in Rogers' shoes in 2024-25. Would you:
   - Renew at current pricing (~$436M/year)?
   - Attempt to renegotiate lower pricing ($250-300M/year)?
   - Walk away and let a competitor acquire rights?
   - Pivot to regional rights only (select teams vs. national exclusivity)?

   Defend your recommendation with supporting analysis.

8. **Alternative History:** If Rogers had bid $350M/year (matching Bell's walk-away price) instead of $436M, would the deal have been profitable? Build a simplified P&L to test this scenario.

### Future-Facing Questions

9. **Emerging Monetization:** What new revenue streams could Rogers develop in the final 2 years of the deal (2024-26) to improve economics?
   - Deeper betting integration (live in-game wagering tied to broadcasts)?
   - International streaming expansion (selling Canadian feeds to international viewers)?
   - NFTs, metaverse experiences, or other Web3 experiments?
   - Enhanced data licensing to betting operators, fantasy platforms?

   Estimate potential revenue for your top recommendation.

10. **Industry Implications:** What lessons should other media companies learn from Rogers' experience? If you were advising a U.S. broadcaster evaluating NBA or MLB rights renewals, what would you tell them based on Rogers/NHL case study?
