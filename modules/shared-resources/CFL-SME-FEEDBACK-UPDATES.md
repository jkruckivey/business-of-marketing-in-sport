## CFL Expansion Project: Milestone 2 - Media & Content Strategy

Building on your market selection from Milestone 1, you'll now develop a media and content strategy for your CFL expansion franchise.

**Your Challenge:** How will your new CFL franchise maximize value within the league's media structure? What local audio partnerships can you secure? What's your content strategy for building fans before the first game?

**Important CFL Context:** Unlike some leagues, CFL media rights are negotiated at the **league level only**—the CFL-TSN deal covers all teams. Your expansion franchise will receive a share of league media revenue, but you won't negotiate your own TV or streaming deals. What you DO control: **Local Radio** and **Local Audio** rights.

**Why This Matters:** Your media strategy isn't about negotiating broadcast deals—it's about (1) understanding what revenue share you'll receive, (2) maximizing your local radio/audio presence, and (3) creating content that builds your fanbase and adds value to the league-wide package.

**Apply Week 2 Frameworks:**
- Understand league-level media economics and revenue sharing
- Design local radio/audio partnerships for your market
- Design fan engagement tactics that move passive viewers to super-fans
- Reference the Rogers/NHL case lessons for understanding long-term deal structures

## CFL Expansion Project: Milestone 3 - Sponsorship & Partnership Strategy

Your CFL expansion city needs sponsors—and more importantly, it needs a STADIUM. In Milestone 1, you analyzed market feasibility. In Milestone 2, you designed media and content strategy. Now you'll build the sponsorship portfolio for your chosen city, starting with the most critical partnership of all.

**CFL Reality Check:** The CFL has identified **BUILDING a stadium** as the #1 barrier to expansion. Any expansion city needs a CFL-ready facility. This creates your biggest sponsorship opportunity: a founding partner who helps fund the stadium bid and construction in exchange for naming rights and long-term partnership.

**Your Challenge:** Design a sponsorship strategy that starts with your anchor deal—the Stadium Development Partner—and builds out a complete sponsorship portfolio. Calculate expected revenue using CPM benchmarks and address ethical considerations.

**Why This Matters:** The stadium partner isn't just naming rights—it's the deal that makes expansion viable. Without a committed stadium partner, your city can't host CFL games.

**Apply Week 3 Frameworks:**
- Identify potential stadium development partners in your market
- Use CPM calculations to value your sponsorship assets
- Apply the 1:2-3 activation rule to project total partnership value
- Consider engagement multipliers if pursuing betting partnerships
