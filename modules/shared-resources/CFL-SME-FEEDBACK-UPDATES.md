# CFL SME Feedback Updates
**Date:** 2026-01-27

---

## SME Feedback Summary

1. **Media Rights Clarification**: Media rights are negotiated at the LEAGUE level only (CFL-TSN deal). Expansion teams control only **Local Radio** and **Local Audio** rights.

2. **Stadium Development**: Building a stadium is the #1 barrier to CFL expansion. This should be positioned as the anchor sponsorship opportunity (Stadium Development Partner).
