## ‚≠ê MAJOR UPDATE: FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION BLOCKS (October 31, 2025)

### NEW CONSISTENCY STANDARD: All Modules Now Include Final Project Connection

**Issue Identified:** Week 3 had "Final Project Connection" blocks in all 6 modules showing how each module's learning connects to the Week 5 capstone assessment. Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5 did not have these blocks, creating inconsistent learning scaffolding and unclear connections to the final strategic vision deliverable.

**Decision Made:** Add "Final Project Connection" blocks to ALL modules across ALL weeks (Weeks 1, 2, 4, 5) to match Week 3's pattern.

**What These Blocks Do:**
- Explicitly connect each module's frameworks to the Week 5 capstone (5-year strategic vision memo)
- Show students HOW to apply week-specific learning to their final project
- Provide real-world application examples and specific integration strategies
- Create narrative thread across entire course showing how each week builds toward synthesis

**Implementation Summary:**

‚úÖ **Week 1:** 8 Final Project Connection blocks added (M0-M7)
- Each block connects revenue ecosystem frameworks to Week 5 capstone
- Examples: M0 (ecosystem thinking), M1 (5-stream model), M3 (interactive widgets data), M6 (executive communication template)
- Files modified: 8 files in `modules/week1/storyboards/modules/`

‚úÖ **Week 2:** 7 Final Project Connection blocks added (M1-M7)
- Each block connects media rights strategy (40-60% of revenue) to capstone media section
- Examples: M1 (media prioritization), M3 (valuation frameworks), M4 (streaming economics), M5A/5B (Rogers case lessons)
- Files modified: 1 file (`modules/week2/uplimit-week2-storyboard.md`) with 7 blocks at key transition points

‚úÖ **Week 3:** ALREADY COMPLETE (6 modules with Final Project Connection blocks intact)
- No changes needed‚ÄîWeek 3 was the template for this consistency standard

‚úÖ **Week 4:** 8 Final Project Connection blocks added (M0-M7)
- Each block connects athlete brand frameworks to capstone partnership/investment strategy
- Examples: M0 (equity vs. income), M1 (women's sports investment thesis), M5 (Serena Williams template), M6 (phased strategy)
- Files modified: 8 files in `modules/week4/storyboards/modules/`

‚úÖ **Week 5:** 2 Final Project Connection blocks added (M0 + M7 synthesis block)
- M0: Frames how Week 5's heritage/innovation tension applies to ANY property in capstone
- M7: Comprehensive course synthesis block showing how all 5 weeks integrate into final strategic vision
- Special M7 block includes complete course framework integration and mastery checklist
- Files modified: 2 files in `modules/week5/storyboards/modules/`

**Total Blocks Added:** 25 Final Project Connection blocks across 26 files

**Pattern Used (consistent across all weeks):**

```markdown
## üéØ FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION

**How Module X Supports Your Final Strategic Vision:**

[Brief intro connecting this module to Week 5 capstone]

**What You Learned:**
- [3-4 key frameworks/insights from this module]

**How to Apply This to Your Final Project:**

[3 specific application strategies with examples]

**Real-World Application:** [1 sentence connecting to professional practice]
```

**Benefits:**
- Students see clear line of sight from every module to final capstone
- Reduces "why am I learning this?" confusion
- Provides concrete templates for applying frameworks to their chosen property
- Creates motivation by showing cumulative value of course learning
- Supports QM Standard 2 (learning objectives clearly aligned with activities and assessments)

**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - All weeks (1-5) now have consistent Final Project Connection scaffolding

## HIGH-PRIORITY CONSISTENCY FIXES (October 31, 2025)

### Issue 1: Inconsistent "Learning Objectives" vs "Learning Outcomes" Terminology

**Problem Identified:**
- Week 1 M1: Used "Learning Objectives" ‚ùå
- Week 3 M1: Used "Learning Objectives" ‚ùå
- Week 4 M1: Used "Learning Outcomes" ‚úÖ

**QM Standard**: Quality Matters requires consistent terminology for measurable learning statements. "Learning Outcomes" is preferred as it emphasizes student achievement.

**Fixes Applied:**

**Week 1 Module 1** (`modules/week1/storyboards/modules/module-1-welcome.md`)
- Line 1: Changed title from "Learning Objectives" ‚Üí "Learning Outcomes"
- Line 20: Changed Infobox title from "Week 1 Learning Objectives" ‚Üí "Week 1 Learning Outcomes"

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - All M1 modules now use "Learning Outcomes"

---

### Issue 1.1: Week 3 Roadmap Element (Not Present in Other Weeks)

**Problem Identified:**
- Week 3 M1: Contains "Element 5: Vertical List - Week 3 Roadmap" showing all 6 modules
- Weeks 1, 4, 5 M1: No roadmap element

**Consistency Issue**: Week 3 had a unique structural element not present in other weeks, creating inconsistent navigation expectations.

**Decision Made**: Remove roadmap from Week 3 to match other weeks (avoid creating 4+ new elements across all weeks)

**Fixes Applied:**

**Week 3 Module 1** (`modules/week3/storyboards/modules/module-1-welcome.md`)
- Line 15: Removed "Element 5: Vertical List - Week 3 roadmap" from table
- Lines 148-172: Removed entire roadmap section
- Line 174: Renumbered "Element 6" ‚Üí "Element 5" (AI Chat Widget)

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - All M1 modules now have consistent structure

---

### Issue 2: Inconsistent Module 0 Closing Section Headings

**Problem Identified:**
- Week 1 M0: "Module 0 Complete - Transition to Module 1"
- Week 4 M0: "Module 0 Complete - Transition to Module 1"
- Week 5 M0: "Module Summary"

**DECISION MADE**: Standardize all M0 modules to **"Module Summary"** (simpler, cleaner heading)

**Fixes Applied:**

**Week 1 Module 0** (`modules/week1/storyboards/modules/module-0-bridge-in.md`)
- Changed "Module 0 Complete - Transition to Module 1" ‚Üí "Module Summary"

**Week 4 Module 0** (`modules/week4/storyboards/modules/module-0-bridge-in.md`)
- Changed "Module 0 Complete - Transition to Module 1" ‚Üí "Module Summary"

**Week 5 Module 0** (`modules/week5/storyboards/modules/module-0-bridge-in.md`)

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - All M0 modules now use "Module Summary"

---

### Issue 3: Module 2 Title Typo

**Problem Identified:**
- Week 1 M2: Titled "Executive Leader Perpsective" ‚ùå (spelling error: "Perpsective")

**Fix Applied:**

**Week 1 Module 2** (`modules/week1/storyboards/modules/module-2-executive.md`)
- Line 1: Changed title from "Executive Leader Perspective" ‚Üí "Executive Perspectives"
- **Note**: Also standardized to plural "Perspectives" to match other weeks

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Typo corrected, title standardized

---

### Issue 4: Incomplete Navigation Button Text

**Problem Identified** (via Uplimit platform browser review):
- Week 5 M1: Button labeled "Next: M1:" (incomplete title) ‚ùå

**Recommendation**: Always include full module title in navigation buttons for clarity.

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **TO FIX** - Requires Uplimit platform edit (not in storyboard files)

---

### Issue 5: Inconsistent AI Roleplay Activity Scaffolding

**Problem Identified** (via Uplimit platform browser review):

**Week 1 M0** has comprehensive roleplay structure:
- "Your Role"
- "Getting Started"
- "The Scenario"
- "What to Have Ready"
- "Your Goal"
- "Conversation Length"
- "What Happens Next"

**Week 4 M0** has minimal scaffolding:
- Only 2 paragraphs before chat interface

**Week 5 M0** has no structured introduction:
- Goes directly to "Ready to begin your roleplay?" prompt

**Standard Pattern Recommendation:**
All AI roleplay activities should include:
1. **Your Role** (who you are)
2. **The Scenario** (the problem)
3. **Your Goal** (what you're trying to accomplish)
4. **Getting Started** (explicit instruction to start conversation if needed)
5. **Conversation Length** (expected time/exchanges)

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **TO STANDARDIZE** - This is embedded in Uplimit AI Roleplay configuration, not easily accessible in storyboard markdown. Recommend updating all roleplay widgets in Uplimit builder to match Week 1 M0 pattern.

---

### Issue 6: Inconsistent Pre-Assessment Quiz Formats

**Problem Identified** (via Uplimit platform browser review):

**Week 1 M0**: Quiz ‚Üí "Quiz Results Coach" chat (scaffolded support)
**Week 4 M0**: Direct quiz widget only (no coach)
**Week 5 M0**: iFrame with challenge previews + quiz (most comprehensive)

**DECISION MADE**: Standardize on **Week 5 format** (challenge preview + quiz in single iframe widget)

**Rationale**: Week 5 format provides:
- Challenge preview showing 4 real problems students will solve
- Immediate context for why quiz questions matter
- Seamless single-widget experience
- Most comprehensive scaffolding without requiring separate coach chat

**Actions Required:**

**Week 1 M0** (`modules/week1/storyboards/modules/module-0-bridge-in.md`):
- [ ] Replace separate quiz + coach chat with combined iframe widget
- [ ] Add 4 challenge preview scenarios (Revenue Problem, Revenue Growth, Investment Strategy, Revenue Sharing)

### Module 3: Core Content - Widget Introductions

**Widget Introduction Pattern Applied to All 7 Widgets**

**Example: Audience Size Calculator** (Lines 361-378)
```markdown
### ‚öô Interactive Activity: Audience Size Calculator

**Practice: MLO 2.1 (Explore media rights valuation)**

You've learned that media rights represent 40-60% of league revenue‚Äîbut what actually determines how much a league can charge for its rights? The answer starts with audience size and demographics.

In this interactive activity, you'll calculate the estimated media rights value for different leagues (NFL, NHL, NBA, MLS, Premier League, or create your own custom league) by manipulating audience size, game count, demographic premiums, and advertising rates. Watch how changing just one variable‚Äîlike increasing coveted demo percentage from 30% to 50%‚Äîcan add hundreds of millions to annual rights value.

**What you'll discover:**

- Why total audience reach (viewers √ó games) matters more than per-game ratings
- How the "coveted demo" (18-49 with $75K+ income) creates valuation premiums
- Why the NFL commands $10B annually while MLS gets $250M despite similar game counts
- That rights valuation is formula-driven, not arbitrary‚Äîyou can calculate it yourself

**Time commitment:** 4-5 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** MLO 2.1 (Explore media rights valuation frameworks)
```

**All 7 widgets with student-facing introductions**:
1. Audience Size Calculator (MLO 2.1) ‚úÖ
2. Exclusivity Bidding Simulator (MLO 2.4) ‚úÖ
3. Platform Economics Visualizer (MLO 2.2) ‚úÖ
4. Engagement Value Chain Builder (MLO 2.3) ‚úÖ
5. Rogers Deal Terms Explorer (MLO 2.4) ‚úÖ
6. Projections vs. Actuals Visualizer (MLO 2.4) ‚úÖ
7. Viewership Trends Analyzer (MLO 2.2) ‚úÖ

**Note**: Week 2 storyboard is a specification document. iframe embed codes will be added during Uplimit platform build phase.

#### Widget 1: Athlete Brand Calculator

**Widget Introduction** (Lines 58-75)

### ‚öô Interactive Activity: Athlete Brand Calculator

**Practice: MLO 4.1 (Five Athlete Revenue Streams) & MLO 4.2 (Owned Assets vs. Endorsements)**

You've heard the theory‚Äînow it's time to build your own athlete brand portfolio. In this interactive tool, you'll allocate $50 million across five revenue streams and watch in real-time as different strategies create dramatically different 20-year wealth outcomes. Will you prioritize endorsements for immediate cash flow, or invest heavily in owned businesses that compound over decades? The choice is yours, and the results might surprise you.

This isn't a passive calculation‚Äîit's an experimentation lab. Try extreme allocations (100% endorsements vs. 100% equity), compare your strategy to Serena Williams' actual portfolio, and discover why Michael Jordan earns more from Nike royalties than he made playing basketball. You'll see the mathematics of wealth-building in action.

**What you'll discover:**

- How equity-based wealth compounds exponentially while fee-based income grows linearly (or declines post-career)
- Why Serena Williams' 70% equity allocation creates 160% more wealth than a 70% endorsement strategy
- The power of diversification vs. concentration‚Äîand when each strategy makes sense
- Real-world portfolio comparisons: Your strategy vs. Serena, LeBron, Michael Jordan, and proven wealth builders

**Time commitment:** 15-20 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** MLO 4.1 (Five athlete revenue streams), MLO 4.2 (Owned assets vs. endorsements)
