```
Before completing your CFL expansion project, revisit Stewart Johnston's interview from Week 1, Module 2. His perspective on league leadership and expansion strategy provides the framework for your capstone brand package.

**Why This Matters:**
In Week 1, you heard Stewart alongside Kevin Abrams to understand how sports organizations generate and manage revenue. Now, with 4 weeks of additional context, Stewart's expansion insights become actionable for your capstone project.

**Key Segments to Revisit:**

📍 **Three Strategic Priorities (22:00-28:00)**
- Entertainment: Machine Gun Kelly halftime, music integration
- Youth engagement: Getting footballs into kids' hands
- Profitability: Creating nine profitable teams ("we're not there yet")

📍 **10-Year Vision & Expansion (28:00-35:00)**
- Expansion NOT in top 3 priorities, but expects 10th team within 10 years
- "Great markets across this country that could support a team"
- Brand positioning as key strategic goal

**Apply to Your Capstone:**
When designing your CFL expansion franchise, demonstrate how your market addresses Stewart's priorities:
1. Does the expansion enhance entertainment value?
2. Does it grow youth engagement?
3. Can the 10th team be profitable?
4. How does it strengthen CFL's brand positioning?
```

Replace current infobox with:

```
Title: ◉ Executive Insights: Heritage Institution Strategy
