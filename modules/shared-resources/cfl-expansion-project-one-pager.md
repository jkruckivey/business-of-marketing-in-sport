## The Challenge

Students develop a comprehensive expansion proposal for a **10th CFL franchise** in a city of their choice. 

---

## Project Structure (5 Milestones)

### Milestone 1: Market Selection & Revenue Projections (Week 1)
**Deliverable:** Market Analysis Brief (2–3 pages)
- Choose an expansion city and justify the selection (population, sports landscape, corporate base, venue options)
- 5-year revenue projections across all five streams
- Competitive analysis: What competes for the same dollars?

### Milestone 2: Media & Content Strategy (Week 2)
**Deliverable:** Media Strategy Memo (2–3 pages)
- CFL–TSN deal structure and revenue-sharing implications (league-level—what you receive)
- **Local Radio & Audio strategy** (the only media rights you control directly)
- Content and fan engagement plan (social media, behind the scenes, community building)

> **Note:** Media rights are negotiated at the LEAGUE level. Expansion teams control Local Radio/Audio only.

### Milestone 3: Sponsorship & Betting Strategy (Week 3)
**Deliverable:** Sponsorship Strategy (2–3 pages)
- **Stadium Development Partnership** (the #1 barrier to expansion—who funds/builds the facility?)
- Sponsorship inventory (stadium naming rights, jersey, category partners)
- Tiered partnership structure with pricing and ROI projections
- Sports betting integration (provincial regulations, operator partnerships, responsible gambling)

> **Note:** The CFL identifies BUILDING a stadium as the largest barrier to expansion. Your anchor sponsorship deal should address this (e.g., "London Life Stadium" in London, ON).

### Milestone 4: Brand Building & Launch Strategy (Week 4)
**Deliverable:** Brand Ambassador & Launch Strategy (2–3 pages)
- Brand identity (name, colours, positioning, connection to city)
- Launch campaign (pre-launch buzz, reveal strategy, season-ticket campaign)
- Community integration (youth programs, school partnerships, charitable foundation)

### Milestone 5: Final Expansion Proposal (Week 5)
**Deliverable:** Executive Summary (3–4 pages)
- Executive overview: Investment thesis—why this market, why now
- Synthesised strategy: Market, media, sponsorship, brand pillars
- Financial summary: 5-year P&L, investment required, break-even
- Risk analysis: Top three risks with mitigation strategies
- 5-year vision: Where this franchise will be in 2031

## Five Revenue Streams Framework

Students must project 5-year revenue across all five streams:

| Revenue Stream | What Students Analyse |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **1. Media Rights** | CFL–TSN revenue sharing (league-level), **Local Radio/Audio** (team-level control), content strategy |
| **2. Ticketing** | Stadium capacity, pricing tiers, attendance projections, game-day experience |
| **3. Sponsorship** | **Stadium development partner**, naming rights, jersey sponsors, tiered partnership structure |
| **4. Merchandise** | New market dynamics, retail strategy, e-commerce, licensing |
| **5. Betting** | Provincial regulations, operator partnerships, in-stadium experience, data licensing |

---

## How Students Are Evaluated

Each milestone is assessed on:
- **Market/Strategic Logic**: Does the analysis make sense for the chosen city?
- **Financial Realism**: Are projections grounded in CFL economics?
- **Framework Application**: Does the work show they learned the course content?
- **Professional Quality**: Is it board-ready?

## Suggested Expansion Cities

| City | Population | Key Consideration | Stadium Status |
|------|------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Halifax** | 450K | No major pro sports, strong football culture, Atlantic market | Needs new build |
| **Quebec City** | 550K | Francophone opportunity, passionate sports market | Existing options |
| **Kitchener-Waterloo** | 600K | Tech hub, young demographics, proximity to Toronto | Needs new build |
| **London, ON** | 500K | Proximity to GTA, university presence, corporate base | TD Stadium (expandable) |
| **Moncton** | 170K | Atlantic alternative, existing stadium, smaller-market risk | Existing stadium |
| **Victoria** | 400K | No CFL presence, limited corporate base | Needs new build |
| **Saskatoon** | 330K | Proven CFL market, but Roughriders cannibalization risk | Existing options |

> **Stadium is the #1 barrier.** Your sponsorship strategy must address how the stadium gets built/funded.

---

## Course Integration

Each milestone builds on weekly course content:

- **Week 1:** Revenue ecosystem analysis
- **Week 2:** Media rights valuation
- **Week 3:** Sponsorship ROI and betting
- **Week 4:** Athlete brands & emerging sports
- **Week 5:** Heritage vs. innovation
