| Revenue Stream | What Students Analyze |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **1. Media Rights** | CFL-TSN revenue sharing, local broadcast partnerships, streaming strategy |
| **2. Ticketing** | Stadium capacity, pricing tiers, attendance projections, game-day experience |
| **3. Sponsorship** | Naming rights, jersey sponsors, tiered partnership structure, activation plans |
| **4. Merchandise** | New market dynamics, retail strategy, e-commerce, licensing |
| **5. Betting** | Provincial regulations, operator partnerships, in-stadium experience, data licensing |

## Assessment Criteria (All Milestones)

| Criterion | Weight | What We Evaluate |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| **Strategic Analysis** | 25% | Sophisticated reasoning, anticipates counterarguments |

## Commissioner's Priorities

Each proposal must demonstrate how the expansion advances Stewart Johnston's three strategic priorities:

1. **"Relentless focus on entertainment"** — More touchdowns, viral moments, highlight plays
2. **"Footballs in kids' hands"** — Flag football, school partnerships, grassroots development
3. **"Create nine profitable teams"** — Revenue sharing implications, not diluting existing franchises

## Suggested Expansion Cities

| City | Population | Key Consideration |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| **Halifax** | 450K | No major pro sports, strong football culture, Atlantic market |
| **Quebec City** | 550K | Francophone opportunity, passionate sports market |
| **London, ON** | 500K | Proximity to GTA, university presence, corporate base |
| **Saskatoon** | 330K | Proven CFL market, but Roughriders cannibalization risk |

---

## Course Integration

Each milestone builds on weekly course content:

- **Week 1:** Revenue ecosystem analysis (Nashville Predators case)
- **Week 2:** Media rights valuation (Rogers/NHL case)
- **Week 3:** Sponsorship ROI & betting (LIV Golf case)
- **Week 4:** Athlete brands & emerging sports (Serena Williams analysis)
- **Week 5:** Heritage vs. innovation (Hockey Hall of Fame case)
