## Five Revenue Streams Framework

Students must project 5-year revenue across all five streams:

| Revenue Stream | What Students Analyse |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **1. Media Rights** | CFL–TSN revenue sharing, local broadcast partnerships, streaming strategy |
| **2. Ticketing** | Stadium capacity, pricing tiers, attendance projections, game-day experience |
| **3. Sponsorship** | Naming rights, jersey sponsors, tiered partnership structure, activation plans |
| **4. Merchandise** | New market dynamics, retail strategy, e-commerce, licensing |
| **5. Betting** | Provincial regulations, operator partnerships, in-stadium experience, data licensing |

## How Students Are Evaluated

Each milestone is assessed on:
- **Market/Strategic Logic**: Does the analysis make sense for the chosen city?
- **Financial Realism**: Are projections grounded in CFL economics?
- **Framework Application**: Does the work show they learned the course content?
- **Professional Quality**: Is it board-ready?

## Suggested Expansion Cities

| City | Population | Key Consideration |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| **Halifax** | 450K | No major pro sports, strong football culture, Atlantic market |
| **Quebec City** | 550K | Francophone opportunity, passionate sports market |
| **Kitchener-Waterloo** | 600K | Tech hub, young demographics, proximity to Toronto |
| **London, ON** | 500K | Proximity to GTA, university presence, corporate base |
| **Moncton** | 170K | Atlantic alternative, existing stadium, smaller-market risk |
| **Victoria** | 400K | No CFL presence, limited corporate base |
| **Saskatoon** | 330K | Proven CFL market, but Roughriders cannibalization risk |

---

## Course Integration

Each milestone builds on weekly course content:

- **Week 1:** Revenue ecosystem analysis
- **Week 2:** Media rights valuation
- **Week 3:** Sponsorship ROI and betting
- **Week 4:** Athlete brands & emerging sports
