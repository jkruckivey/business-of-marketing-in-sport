**Version:** 1.1.0 | **Last Updated:** 2025-12-07
**Status:** Ready for implementation

## Project Overview

### The Challenge

The Canadian Football League is considering expansion. As CFL Commissioner Stewart Johnston said in his Week 1 executive interview: **"If we haven't got a 10th team in Canada by ten years from now, I'll be disappointed."** As a consulting team, you will develop a comprehensive expansion proposal for a new CFL franchise in a city of your choice—directly addressing the commissioner's vision.

Your proposal must address all aspects of launching a successful professional sports franchise, integrating frameworks from all 5 weeks of the course.

### Why This Project?

League expansion is one of the most complex strategic decisions in professional sports. It requires:
- Revenue stream analysis and projections (Week 1)
- Media rights implications and content strategy (Week 2)
- Sponsorship acquisition and betting partnerships (Week 3)
- Brand building from scratch in a new market (Week 4)
- Balancing CFL heritage with innovation and growth (Week 5)

This project synthesizes everything you learn across the course into a single, cohesive strategic recommendation.

### Directly From the Commissioner

**Stewart Johnston's Three Strategic Priorities** (from Week 1 interview):
1. **Relentless focus on entertainment** - "We need to create more touchdowns, more highlight reel plays, more viral moments"
2. **Getting footballs into kids' hands** - Flag football, physical education partnerships, grassroots development
3. **Create nine profitable teams** - "We're not there yet"

Your expansion proposal must demonstrate how a 10th team advances these priorities—not just adds another franchise.

**Commissioner's Key Insight:** "Football is having a moment." Your proposal should capitalize on this timing.

### Team Structure

- **Team size:** 3-4 members
- **Formation:** Week 1 (teams formed during Module 4 sprint)
- **Collaboration:** Asynchronous with optional synchronous check-ins
- **Tools:** Shared document (Google Docs/Notion), team communication channel

## Project Milestones

### Milestone 1: Market Selection & Revenue Projections (Week 1)
**Due:** End of Week 1 | **Weight:** 15% of project grade

#### Deliverable: Market Analysis Brief (2-3 pages)

**Choose your expansion city and justify the selection:**

1. **City Selection Criteria**
   - Population and demographics (minimum viable market size)
   - Existing sports landscape (competition for attention/dollars)
   - Corporate base for sponsorship potential
   - Stadium/venue options (existing or new build)
   - Historical CFL presence or football culture

2. **5-Year Revenue Projections**
   Using the Week 1 revenue stream framework, project Year 1-5 revenue across:
   - Media rights allocation (CFL revenue sharing model)
   - Ticketing (capacity, pricing tiers, attendance projections)
   - Sponsorship (local market potential)
   - Merchandising (new market dynamics)
   - Betting partnerships (provincial regulations)

3. **Competitive Analysis**
   - What other sports/entertainment competes for the same dollars?
   - How does CFL positioning differ from NHL, NBA, MLS in this market?

**Suggested Cities to Consider:**
- Halifax (Atlantic Canada expansion)
- Quebec City (francophone market)
- Saskatoon (Saskatchewan's second team)
- London, ON (Southern Ontario)
- Moncton (Maritime hub)
- US markets (if pursuing international expansion angle)

**Apply Stewart Johnston's Revenue Insights (Week 1 Interview):**
Stewart identified the **two biggest league-level revenue drivers**: media rights and commercial partnerships (sponsorships). Consider:
- How does adding a 10th team increase the CFL's media rights value for TSN?
- What new corporate partnership opportunities does your market unlock?
- How does your market contribute to "creating nine profitable teams" (Stewart's priority #3)?
- Does your market have the corporate base to drive sponsorship revenue?

**Stewart's Key Data Points:**
- Gray Cup 2024: 12% ratings increase
- Winnipeg model: Sold out every game, profitable franchise
- Only 9 home games per team (scarcity creates event atmosphere)

**Rubric Alignment:** WLO 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4

### Milestone 2: Media & Content Strategy (Week 2)

- **Digital transformation**: CFL is investing in new website, mobile app, and season-long fantasy game. How does your market integrate with these platforms?
- **"Make content so valuable it drives subscription and advertising dollars"**—Stewart's media strategy insight
- **Youth engagement**: Content on platforms where younger demographics consume media (YouTube, social-first)

**Stewart's Unique Perspective:**
