# Data Framing Guidelines

**Purpose:** Ensure all modeled numbers, estimates, and projections are clearly framed as illustrative rather than audited facts.

---

## 1. Suggested Framing Language

Use these phrases to keep numbers clearly "modeled" rather than asserted as audited facts.

### For Modeled Dollar Impacts (McDavid, ecosystem widgets, etc.)

- "The figures below are **illustrative estimates** based on typical team economics, not audited financials."
- "In this **simplified model**, signing a star generates approximately $X in direct revenue and $Y in indirect ecosystem value."
- "Treat these numbers as **scenario assumptions** to explore trade-offs, not as exact historical results."
- "Analysts often build models where a star player's impact on media, sponsorship, and playoffs yields **multi-million-dollar upside** beyond salary cost."

### For Revenue Mix Percentages by Stream

- "In many major leagues, media rights **often account for the largest share** of revenue, frequently in the 40–60% range, with ticketing and sponsorship making up most of the remainder."
- "Specific percentages vary by league and season; these bands are **typical ranges**, not precise current-year figures."
- "Betting and gaming currently represent a **small but fast-growing** share of total revenue in most markets."

### For Growth-Rate Claims (e.g., betting 30–40% YoY)

- "In recent years, some sports betting markets have posted **double-digit annual growth**, especially in newly legalized regions."
- "Regulated sports betting is among the **fastest-growing** sports revenue segments, though growth rates differ by jurisdiction."

### For Media-Rights Contract Duration

- "Top-tier media rights deals are typically **multi-year contracts**, often running 7–12 years for major leagues."

### For Revenue Sharing (NFL 60%, NHL 50%, EPL tiered)

- "Leagues such as the NFL and NHL rely on **substantial revenue sharing** of national media and licensing income; exact percentages vary by agreement but often fall around half of those revenues."
- "The Premier League uses a **tiered distribution model** that combines equal shares with performance- and appearance-based components."

### For Women's Sports Numbers

- "Women's sports currently generate **less than 2%** of US sports revenues but could grow **around 250% by 2030** under realistic investment scenarios."
- "Reports project that women's sports could reach **at least $2.5B in US rights-holder value by 2030**, driven primarily by sponsorship and ticketing."

### For "$110B Sports Content Market" in Media Alt Text

- "Global sports media is now a **well over $100 billion** market when you combine major league deals and international rights."

## 2. When to Apply These Guidelines

- **Interactive widgets** with dollar amounts or percentages
- **Video scripts** citing specific figures
- **Storyboard text** making quantitative claims
- **Alt text** for images referencing market sizes
- **Case study introductions** using industry benchmarks

## 3. Source Attribution

When possible, cite the source category:
- "According to industry analysts..."
- "Based on publicly reported deal terms..."
- "Using typical league revenue distributions..."

This maintains credibility while acknowledging these are models, not audited statements.
