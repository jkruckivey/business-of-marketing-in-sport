## Part 1: Discussion Forum Prompts

### Week 1 Discussion Prompts

#### Discussion #1: Revenue Interdependence in Action
**Module:** Module 2 (After Executive Video)
**Timing:** Post-video engagement
**Purpose:** Apply ecosystem thinking to personal sports fandom

**Prompt:**
The executive emphasized that revenue streams are "interdependent, not independent"—investment in one area creates ripple effects across others.

**Your Task:**
1. **Identify one example** from your own sports fandom where you've seen this interdependence in action. This could be:
   - A team that invested in star players → increased ticket sales → better media deals
   - A league that improved broadcast quality → higher viewership → more sponsor interest
   - A venue upgrade → better fan experience → increased season ticket renewals

2. **Analyze the connections:** Which revenue streams were affected? How did the investment ripple through the ecosystem?

3. **Assess the outcome:** Was it successful? Why or why not?

**Guidelines:**
- Initial post: 200-300 words
- Respond to at least 2 classmates' examples (100-150 words each)
- Due: [Date] by 11:59 PM

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Quality of example (specific, detailed, relevant): 40%
- Analysis of interconnections (shows ecosystem thinking): 40%
- Peer engagement (thoughtful responses): 20%

**Sample Strong Response:**
> "I'm a Golden State Warriors fan, and I saw this ecosystem effect firsthand with the Chase Center opening in 2019. The Warriors invested $1.4 billion in a state-of-the-art arena with premium hospitality suites, tech integrations, and a surrounding entertainment district.
>
> **Interdependencies I observed:**
> - **Ticketing → Sponsorship:** Premium seating sold out at $10K-25K per seat, creating exclusive hospitality inventory that attracted tech sponsors (Oracle, Rakuten, JPMorgan Chase).
> - **Venue → Media Value:** The modern arena with better production capabilities made broadcasts more visually appealing, increasing local TV ratings by 15%.
> - **Atmosphere → Merchandise:** The enhanced fan experience (LED light shows, AR features) created more "Instagram moments," driving social media buzz and merchandise sales.
>
> **Outcome:** The Warriors generated $700M in revenue in their first Chase Center season—the most in NBA history. The venue investment paid for itself in 5 years (projected 10-15 years). This shows how a single capital investment can amplify multiple revenue streams simultaneously."

**Instructor Facilitation:**
- Highlight 2-3 exceptional examples in weekly announcement
- Connect examples back to Week 1 learning outcomes
- Pose follow-up questions to deepen discussion

#### Discussion #2: Investment Trade-Offs
**Module:** Module 4 (After Revenue Empire Builder Simulation)
**Timing:** Post-activity reflection
**Purpose:** Share simulation strategies and learn from peers

**Prompt:**
You've just completed the Revenue Empire Builder simulation, where you allocated $50M across five revenue streams. No two strategies are identical—let's learn from each other's approaches.

**Your Task:**
1. **Share your strategy:**
   - Which revenue stream did you invest in most heavily? Why?
   - Which stream did you deprioritize? Why?
   - What was your path to profitability? (How many years? What was your final score?)

2. **Reflect on surprises:**
   - What surprised you about how the streams interacted?
   - What scenario events (e.g., recession, new competitor, COVID) forced you to pivot?

3. **Learn from others:**
   - Read 3 classmates' strategies.
   - Identify one approach you DIDN'T try but now wish you had.
   - Comment on what you learned from their strategy.

**Guidelines:**
- Initial post: 250-350 words
- Respond to 3 classmates (100-150 words each, must include "What I learned from your strategy...")
- Due: [Date] by 11:59 PM

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Depth of reflection (self-awareness, strategic thinking): 40%
- Learning from peers (meaningful engagement): 40%
- Application to concepts (connect to readings/video): 20%

**Sample Strong Response:**
> "I went with an **Anchor Property strategy**, investing 60% ($30M) in exclusive NHL rights and 20% ($10M) in premium ticketing. I deprioritized merchandising (10%, $5M) and emerging streams like betting (10%, $5M) because I wanted to be 'Home of Hockey' in Canada.
>
> **My results:** Achieved profitability in Year 6, final score 72/100. Not great—but here's why:
>
> **What surprised me:** Exclusive NHL rights locked me into high annual costs ($400M+/year), and when viewership declined 15% in Year 3 (aging demographics), my ad revenue tanked. I had no diversification to cushion the blow. Meanwhile, competitors with diversified portfolios (soccer + basketball + niche sports) weathered the storm better.
>
> **Scenario impact:** COVID in Year 5 crushed me—shortened season, no fans, 40% revenue drop. I had no flexibility clause in my rights deal, so I still paid full fees while losing $200M. That delayed profitability by 2 years.
>
> **What I'd do differently:** I'd use a **Buffet Approach**—spread $50M across 4 properties instead of going all-in on NHL. Lower risk, broader appeal, more flexibility. Profitability might take longer, but it's more sustainable.
>
> Looking forward to seeing others' strategies—especially those who achieved profitability in Year 3-4!"

**Instructor Facilitation:**
- Create summary post highlighting "3 Paths to Profitability" (Anchor, Buffet, Emerging)
- Connect discussion back to Rogers NHL case: "Rogers used Anchor Property strategy—how did that work out?"

#### Discussion #3: Strategic vs. Financial Value
**Module:** Module 6 (During Reflection Memo Period)
**Timing:** Concurrent with assessment
**Purpose:** Debate strategic decision-making in ambiguous situations

**Prompt:**
In the executive video, the leader argued that many sports rights deals "lose money on a P&L basis but create strategic value." This logic justified Rogers' $5.2B NHL deal, Amazon's $1B NFL investment, and Apple's MLS streaming bet.

**The Question:** At what point does "strategic value" become an excuse for bad business decisions?

**Your Task:**
Take a position:

**Position A:** Strategic value is real and measurable.
- Defend with examples where "loss-making" content deals paid off strategically
- Explain how to quantify strategic value (subscriber retention, brand lift, platform engagement)

**Position B:** Strategic value is often a post-hoc rationalization.
- Argue that deals should stand on financial merit alone
- Provide examples where "strategic" bets failed spectacularly

**Position C:** It depends (nuanced middle ground).
- Identify criteria for when strategic value justifies financial losses
- Explain where you draw the line

**Guidelines:**
- Initial post: 300-400 words (state position, provide 2+ examples, defend with logic)
- Respond to 2 classmates who took a DIFFERENT position (150-200 words)
- Due: [Date] by 11:59 PM (Note: Can inform your Reflection Memo!)

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Argumentation quality (logic, evidence, persuasiveness): 50%
- Engagement with opposing views (respectful, substantive): 30%
- Application of course concepts: 20%

**Sample Strong Response (Position C):**
> "I take Position C: Strategic value justifies financial losses—BUT only under three strict conditions:
>
> **Condition #1: The strategic benefit is measurable.**
> Rogers claimed NHL rights would 'prevent cord-cutting.' That's testable. Did subscriber churn rates drop for sports households vs. non-sports households? If yes, quantify the retained revenue. If no, the strategic case fails. Amazon tracks Prime membership sign-ups from NFL Thursday Night Football—that's measurable strategic value.
>
> **Condition #2: The payback period is defined.**
> Netflix said, 'We'll lose money on content for 5 years to build subscriber base.' They set a clear timeline. Investors knew the plan. Rogers, by contrast, kept moving the profitability goalposts (Year 5 → Year 7 → Year 10). That's a red flag.
>
> **Condition #3: There's a Plan B if strategic value doesn't materialize.**
> Apple's MLS deal ($2.5B over 10 years) is a strategic bet on live sports driving Apple TV+ adoption. But if it fails, Apple can afford the loss—it's <1% of annual revenue. For Rogers, NHL rights were 40% of Rogers Media revenue. No Plan B = reckless.
>
> **My line:** If a deal meets all three conditions, strategic value is legitimate. If not, it's speculation disguised as strategy.
>
> **Example of legitimate strategic value:** Amazon NFL ($1B/year). Measurable (Prime sign-ups), defined timeline (5-year deal), and Plan B (Amazon retail profits cover losses).
>
> **Example of strategic value excuse:** Rogers NHL ($433M/year). Unmeasured subscriber retention, undefined profitability timeline, no Plan B. Strategic value became an excuse for overpaying."

**Instructor Facilitation:**
- Synthesize debate in weekly summary: "35% Position A, 40% Position B, 25% Position C"
- Connect to Week 2 Rogers case: "How does this debate frame your Mini-Case Memo analysis?"

### Week 2 Discussion Prompts

#### Discussion #4: Your Streaming Wars Strategy
**Module:** Module 4 (After Simulation Completion, Before Part 2 Video)
**Timing:** Between simulation and executive debrief
**Purpose:** Peer learning before watching expert feedback

**Prompt:**
You've completed the Streaming Wars Strategy simulation. Before watching Part 2 of the executive session (where they analyze strategies), let's share and learn from each other.

**Your Task:**
1. **Document your approach:**
   - Which strategy did you choose? (Anchor Property, Buffet, Emerging Sports, Hybrid)
   - Which rights did you acquire? At what cost?
   - What subscription price did you set?
   - Results: Years to profitability? Final subscriber count? Profitability margin?

2. **Share your biggest challenge:**
   - What was the hardest decision you faced?
   - Did any scenario event (competitor launch, rights expiration, economic downturn) force a major pivot?

3. **Crowdsource wisdom:**
   - Read 3 classmates' strategies—at least one must be DIFFERENT from yours.
   - Identify one smart move you didn't think of.

**Guidelines:**
- Initial post: 300-400 words
- Respond to 3 classmates with different strategies (100-150 words, focus on "What I learned...")
- Due: [Date] by 11:59 PM (BEFORE watching Part 2 video)

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Strategy documentation (clear, detailed): 40%
- Critical reflection (identifies challenges, trade-offs): 30%
- Learning from peers (meaningful synthesis): 30%

**Instructor Facilitation:**
- After discussion closes, direct students to Part 2 video: "Now watch the executive debrief and see how your strategies compare!"

#### Discussion #5: Rogers' 2026 Decision
**Module:** Module 6 (During Mini-Case Memo Period)
**Timing:** Concurrent with assessment
**Purpose:** Debate actionable recommendations

**Prompt:**
Rogers' NHL deal expires in 2026. They have four options:

**Option A:** Renew exclusive rights (likely $600-700M/year, up from $433M)
**Option B:** Renew non-exclusive rights (share with TSN, lower cost ~$300-400M/year)
**Option C:** Walk away (invest $400M/year in building streaming tech, acquiring niche sports, international expansion)
**Option D:** Partner with tech company (Apple, Amazon, Google) to co-bid and co-invest

**Your Task:**
1. **Make your recommendation:** Which option would you choose if you were Rogers' CEO? Why?
2. **Defend with evidence:** Use data from the case exhibits to support your choice.
3. **Address risks:** What's the biggest risk of your recommendation? How would you mitigate it?

**Guidelines:**
- Initial post: 350-450 words
- Respond to 2 classmates who chose DIFFERENT options (150-200 words, challenge their assumptions respectfully)
- Due: [Date] by 11:59 PM

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Recommendation quality (defensible, evidence-based): 50%
- Risk awareness (identifies and mitigates downsides): 30%
- Peer engagement (thoughtful challenges): 20%

**Instructor Facilitation:**
- Poll the class: "What % chose each option?"
- Highlight best arguments for each option in synthesis post
- Connect to real-world: "In reality, Rogers renewed with a hybrid approach—non-exclusive national, exclusive regional"

- Use Uplimit discussion boards or external platform (Canvas, Moodle, Slack)
- Enable threaded replies for better conversation flow
- Set clear deadlines for initial posts and replies
- Consider "pinning" exemplary posts

**Peer Review Logistics:**
- Use Google Docs for draft sharing (easy commenting)
- Or use Uplimit's peer review feature (if available)
- Provide feedback form as fillable PDF or Google Form
- Randomly pair students to ensure diverse perspectives

**Grading Efficiency:**
- Discussion forums: Grade on participation quality (not content correctness)
- Peer reviews: Spot-check 20% for quality, rest credit/no-credit
- Use rubrics for consistency

### For Students

**Discussion Forum Best Practices:**
- Write initial post in Google Docs first (save draft, check word count)
- Reference specific course content (readings, videos, data points)
- Respond to peers substantively (not just "I agree!")
- Use professional tone (you're practicing business communication)

**Peer Review Best Practices:**
- Be constructive, not critical (focus on improvement)
- Provide specific feedback (not "needs more detail"—say WHICH part needs detail)
- Balance strengths and suggestions (2:1 ratio)
- Reference rubric criteria (helps author prioritize revisions)
