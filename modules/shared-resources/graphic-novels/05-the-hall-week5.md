Title: THE HALL
Visual Description: Painted illustration of the Hockey Hall of Fame building in Toronto, but split in two by a glowing golden line. On the LEFT, the classic stone architecture with vintage trophies visible through windows, sepia-toned and nostalgic. On the RIGHT, the same building but transformed with digital screens, holographic displays, and modern technology, vibrant blues and purples. Standing at the threshold between both worlds is ELENA KOWALSKI, a Ukrainian-Canadian woman in her 50s, touching the Stanley Cup with one hand and holding a tablet showing analytics with the other. The past and future meet in her. 16:9 aspect ratio.

Dialogue (ELENA - thought): "We're losing them. Every year, fewer visitors. Fewer members. Fewer sponsors."

[PANEL 2]

Shot Type & Angle: Wide shot showing divided room.
