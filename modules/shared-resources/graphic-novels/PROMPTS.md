## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Wrong labels generated (e.g., "The Sky" instead of "TICKETS") | Use explicit label format in script and prompt: "RIVER 1 - TICKETS" not just "Tickets" |
| Extra elements added (e.g., 6th river, 6th pillar) | Add "ONLY five" and "do not add others" constraints in prompt |
| Typography rendered as text in images | Remove ALL Production Notes from script before upload |
| Style inconsistent across pages | Reinforce "Retro Sports Illustrated" and "1970s-80s painted" in prompt |
| Dialogue missing from panels | Ensure dialogue is on its own line with character name prefix in script |
| Panels out of order | Each [PAGE] should be clearly separated with --- dividers |
| Characters look different across panels | Include consistent character descriptions (age, ethnicity, clothing) in early panels |
