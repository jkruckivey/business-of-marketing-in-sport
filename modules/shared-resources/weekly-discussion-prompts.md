## Week 1: The Business of Sport - Where the Money Flows

**Theme/Key Takeaway:** *Revenue streams don't operate in isolation—they form an interconnected ecosystem where success in one area amplifies others.*

### Discussion Prompts

**1. Share Your "Aha" Moment**
Kevin Abrams described the NY Giants as a "$10 billion mom-and-pop shop." What surprised you most about how professional sports organizations actually operate? Share one insight that challenged your assumptions.

**2. Your Local Connection**
Think about a sports team or event in your city/region. Which of the 5 revenue streams do you think they rely on most heavily? Why might their mix differ from an NFL or NHL franchise?

**3. The Cascade Effect**
In the Revenue Ecosystem Challenge, you discovered that investing in "foundation" streams (ticketing, fan experience) can increase merchandise and sponsorship revenue *without direct investment* in those areas. Can you think of a business outside sports where this "cascade effect" might apply?

## Week 2: Media, Content & Fan Engagement

**Theme/Key Takeaway (from Week 1):** *Understanding the 5 revenue streams revealed that media rights dominate (40-60% of revenue)—but WHY do they command such premium valuations?*

### Discussion Prompts

**1. The $5.2B Question**
Rogers paid nearly 3x more per year than the previous NHL deal. Before analyzing the case study—what's your gut instinct: Was this a brilliant strategic move or a costly mistake? Why?

**2. Your Viewing Habits**
"Appointment viewing" means content that must be consumed live. Think honestly about your own media consumption: What's the last sporting event you watched LIVE because you couldn't risk spoilers? What made it "must-see" in real time?

**3. Streaming vs. Traditional**
If you were advising a mid-tier league (like MLS or the CFL), would you recommend pursuing a traditional broadcast deal or going all-in on streaming? What trade-offs would you consider?

## Week 3: Sponsorship & Betting

**Theme/Key Takeaway (from Week 2):** *Media rights create audience reach, but sponsorship and betting transform that reach into deeper monetization—the "super-fan" is worth 20-40x a passive viewer.*

### Discussion Prompts

**1. Activation vs. Logo Placement**
Think of a sports sponsorship you've personally noticed. Was it just a logo on a jersey/stadium, or did the brand create an experience that engaged you? Share an example of sponsorship done well (or poorly).

**2. The Betting Debate**
Sports betting is the fastest-growing revenue stream but carries significant risk. In your view, should leagues embrace betting partnerships aggressively, or proceed cautiously? What's at stake beyond revenue?

**3. If You Were CMO**
Imagine you're the Chief Marketing Officer for a brand with $5M to spend on sports sponsorship. Would you sponsor a major league (broad reach, high cost) or an emerging property like women's soccer (smaller reach, lower cost, growth potential)? What factors would drive your decision?

## Week 4: Athletes, Brands & Emerging Sports

**Theme/Key Takeaway (from Week 3):** *Sponsorship ROI depends on engagement, not just impressions—and no one drives engagement like star athletes who've built authentic personal brands.*

### Discussion Prompts

**1. Equity vs. Fees**
Serena Williams built a $300M+ net worth through owned businesses (equity), not just endorsement deals (fees). Think of an athlete you follow—are they building long-term wealth or just collecting paychecks? What would you advise them to do differently?

**2. The 78% Problem**
Research shows 78% of NFL players experience financial distress within 2 years of retirement. What systemic factors contribute to this? What responsibility do leagues, teams, or agents have?

**3. Women's Sports Investment Thesis**
Women's sports viewership is growing 300%+ while still commanding lower sponsorship rates. If you had capital to invest in sports media rights, would you bet on women's sports as a growth opportunity? What's your investment thesis?

## Week 5: Legacy, Culture & Future

**Theme/Key Takeaway (from Week 4):** *Athletes and emerging sports must build sustainable brands that outlast any single season—the same challenge facing heritage organizations trying to stay relevant across generations.*

### Discussion Prompts

**1. Tradition vs. Innovation**
Think of a beloved sports brand (team, league, or venue) that's struggled to modernize. What made them slow to adapt? Conversely, share an example of a heritage property that successfully evolved without losing its soul.

**2. Your CFL City Reflection**
Throughout this course, you've been building a CFL expansion proposal. Without revealing your final recommendation—what was the hardest strategic trade-off you faced? Revenue potential vs. fan base? Short-term vs. long-term?

**3. Letter to Your Future Self**
In 5 years, what do you predict will be the biggest change in sports business? AI? Sustainability mandates? Global expansion? Women's sports dominance? Write a bold prediction and explain your reasoning.
