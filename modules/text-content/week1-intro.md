# Week 1 Introduction
## The Business of Sport: A Unique Revenue Ecosystem

Professional sport operates unlike any other industry. Teams compete on the field but must collaborate financially to maintain competitive balance. Revenue streams are interdependentâ€”strong media rights deals fund player salaries, which attract talent, which creates compelling content, which increases media value.

This week, we explore the five major revenue streams that power professional sport: media rights, ticketing and attendance, sponsorship and partnerships, merchandising, and the emerging betting/gaming sector. We'll examine not just how money flows IN, but how it flows BETWEEN stakeholders through complex revenue sharing arrangements.

You'll learn why the NFL shares 60% of all revenue equally among teams, while European soccer operates on a more entrepreneurial model. You'll understand why the NBA invested billions in creating its own streaming infrastructure, and why betting legalization fundamentally changes sport's economic equation.
