# Media Rights Part 1: The Dominance

Media rights—the fees paid by broadcasters and streaming services to air games—represent the **largest revenue stream** for most professional leagues, typically accounting for **40-60% of total revenue**.

## Massive Deals Define the Landscape

These deals are massive: the NFL's current media rights contracts total **$110 billion over 11 years** ($10B/year), while the English Premier League generates over **$5 billion per year** from domestic and international broadcast rights. In Canada, Rogers Communications paid **$5.2 billion over 12 years** for NHL rights—the largest media rights deal in Canadian sports history.

## Why Sports Command Premium Value

The economic logic is straightforward: **sports content attracts large, engaged, live audiences**—a rarity in an era of on-demand entertainment. Advertisers pay premium rates because viewers can't fast-forward through commercials during live games.

**Key Economics:**
- **Cost per thousand viewers (CPM)** for premium sports: **$50-70**
- **CPM for scripted television:** **$15-25**
- **Premium multiplier:** Sports command **3-4× higher advertising rates**

Broadcasters generate revenue through two channels:
1. **Advertising sales** during games
2. **Carriage fees** - monthly fees cable companies pay to carry channels like ESPN or TSN

## Long-Term Stability

For leagues, broadcast deals provide **predictable, long-term revenue**:
- NHL's Canadian deal with Rogers: **12 years**
- NBA's U.S. deals: **9 years**
- NFL contracts: **11 years**

This stability allows teams to make long-term financial commitments like player contracts and facility investments. Unlike ticketing (variable based on performance) or sponsorship (dependent on corporate health), media rights provide guaranteed cash flow.
