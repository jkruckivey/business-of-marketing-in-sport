# Understanding Sport Revenue Streams

Professional sports organizations generate revenue through five major streams, each with distinct characteristics, risks, and growth trajectories. Unlike traditional businesses where revenue sources operate independently, sport revenue streams are deeply interconnected—creating what industry experts call a **"revenue ecosystem"** rather than a portfolio.

This module explores each stream in detail, examining how they generate value, their relative importance to different leagues and teams, and how strategic decisions in one stream cascade through others. Understanding these dynamics is essential for anyone working in sports business, from team executives to marketing professionals to investors.

**The Five Major Revenue Streams:**

1. **Media Rights** (40-60% of revenue) - Broadcasting and streaming deals
2. **Ticketing & Live Events** (20-30% of revenue) - Gate receipts and in-venue spending
3. **Sponsorship & Partnerships** (15-25% of revenue) - Corporate deals and brand alignment
4. **Merchandising & Licensing** (5-10% of revenue) - Apparel and licensed products
5. **Betting & Gaming** (2-8% and growing) - The emerging frontier

As you work through this module, pay attention to how these streams interconnect. An investment in one area often creates ripple effects across the entire ecosystem—a principle that separates strategic sports business leaders from purely financial operators.
