# Ticketing Part 1: The Live Experience

Ticketing and live event revenue—including ticket sales, premium seating, and in-venue spending—accounts for **20-30% of total revenue** for most teams. Unlike media rights, which are negotiated at the league level and often shared, ticketing revenue is largely **local and team-controlled**.

## Variable Revenue Dynamics

Ticketing revenue fluctuates based on factors outside team control:

**Team Performance:**
- Playoff contention drives ticket demand
- Winning teams sell more season tickets
- Losing teams face empty seats and discounting

**Market Size Differences:**
- Toronto Maple Leafs sell out 18,500 seats at $150+ average
- Ottawa Senators struggle to fill 18,000 seats at $75 average
- Market population and corporate base matter immensely

**Opponent Quality:**
- Yankees vs. Red Sox sells out at premium prices
- Yankees vs. Orioles requires discounting
- Rivalry games command 2-3× normal prices

## Dynamic Pricing Revolution

Dynamic pricing—adjusting ticket prices based on demand—has become standard practice. Prices fluctuate based on:

- **Opponent quality** (Lakers vs. Warriors vs. Pistons)
- **Team performance** (playoff contention increases demand)
- **Day of week** (weekend vs. weekday games)
- **Special events** (giveaways, jersey retirements, rivalry matchups)
- **Time to event** (last-minute purchases)

**Real Example:**
The Toronto Raptors might charge **$150** for a Tuesday game against Detroit, but **$400** for a Saturday game against the Lakers.

Technology platforms like SeatGeek, Ticketmaster, and proprietary systems analyze real-time demand, weather, team news, and historical data to optimize pricing **thousands of times per day**.

## Impact on Revenue

Over a full season, dynamic pricing can **increase ticketing revenue by 15-25%** compared to static pricing. This is particularly valuable for:
- Non-premium inventory (upper bowl seats)
- Midweek games against weak opponents
- Late-season games when playoff picture is clear

The key tradeoff: Maximizing short-term revenue vs. maintaining fan loyalty. Fans accustomed to $100 tickets who suddenly see $250 prices may feel exploited, harming long-term relationships.
