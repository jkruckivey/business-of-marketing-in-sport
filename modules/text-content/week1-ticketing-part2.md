# Ticketing Part 2: The Premium Seating Strategy

The evolution of stadium economics has shifted dramatically from a **"fill the seats"** model to a **"maximize per-capita revenue"** model. Modern venues are designed with tiered experiences that extract maximum value from affluent customers.

## Premium Seating Tiers

**Luxury Suites:**
- **$100,000-500,000 per season** (annual commitment)
- Private rooms with 12-24 seats
- Catering, dedicated waitstaff, private bathrooms
- Primarily sold to corporations for client entertainment

**Club Seats:**
- **$5,000-15,000 per seat per season**
- Exclusive lounges with upscale dining
- Premium sight lines (lower bowl, center ice/court)
- Individual seats, not full suites

**Courtside/Field Level:**
- **$500-2,000+ per game** for individual tickets
- Celebrity seating, visible on broadcasts
- Concierge service, meet-and-greet access
- Status symbol as much as viewing experience

## The Critical Economic Insight

Here's the revolutionary finding that transformed stadium design:

**Premium seating generates 40-50% of ticketing revenue despite representing only 10-15% of capacity.**

This explains why virtually every stadium renovation or new construction prioritizes premium inventory expansion. A new building isn't just about replacing old seats—it's about adding 20-30 luxury suites that each generate more revenue than 100 general admission seats combined.

## Personal Seat Licenses (PSLs)

Some teams sell **Personal Seat Licenses**—one-time fees (often $5,000-75,000) for the right to purchase season tickets in premium locations. PSLs generate massive upfront capital:

- **SoFi Stadium (Rams/Chargers):** Generated over **$600 million** from PSL sales
- Funds stadium construction without increasing team debt
- Controversial: Fans pay thousands just for the *right* to buy expensive tickets

## Beyond the Ticket: Gameday Spending

Total non-ticket revenue can reach **$40-50 per attendee**, including:

**Concessions:**
- Food and beverage: $10 beers, $8 hot dogs
- Premium catering in suites
- Average per-capita spending: **$15-30**

**Parking:**
- Premium parking: **$50-100 per game**
- General parking: **$20-40 per game**

**Merchandise:**
- In-venue retail shops
- Game-day only items (commemorative shirts, playoff gear)

This turns a $100 ticket into **$140-150 in total venue spending**—why teams view declining attendance as a crisis affecting the entire in-venue ecosystem, not just ticket sales.
