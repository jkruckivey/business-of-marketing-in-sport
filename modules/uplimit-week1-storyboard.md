The Business of Sport: A Unique Revenue Ecosystem

Professional sport operates unlike any other industry. Teams compete on the field
but must collaborate financially to maintain competitive balance. Revenue streams
are interdependent‚Äîstrong media rights deals fund player salaries, which attract
talent, which creates compelling content, which increases media value.

This week, we explore the five major revenue streams that power professional sport:
media rights, ticketing and attendance, sponsorship and partnerships, merchandising,
and the emerging betting/gaming sector. We'll examine not just how money flows IN,
but how it flows BETWEEN stakeholders through complex revenue sharing arrangements.

You'll learn why the NFL shares 60% of all revenue equally among teams, while
European soccer operates on a more entrepreneurial model. You'll understand why
the NBA invested billions in creating its own streaming infrastructure, and why
betting legalization fundamentally changes sport's economic equation.

# Understanding Sport Revenue Streams

Professional sports organizations generate revenue through five major streams, each with distinct characteristics, risks, and growth trajectories. Unlike traditional businesses where revenue sources operate independently, sport revenue streams are deeply interconnected‚Äîcreating what industry experts call a **"revenue ecosystem"** rather than a portfolio.

This module explores each stream in detail, examining how they generate value, their relative importance to different leagues and teams, and how strategic decisions in one stream cascade through others. Understanding these dynamics is essential for anyone working in sports business, from team executives to marketing professionals to investors.

**The Five Major Revenue Streams:**

1. **Media Rights** (40-60% of revenue) - Broadcasting and streaming deals
2. **Ticketing & Live Events** (20-30% of revenue) - Gate receipts and in-venue spending
3. **Sponsorship & Partnerships** (15-25% of revenue) - Corporate deals and brand alignment
4. **Merchandising & Licensing** (5-10% of revenue) - Apparel and licensed products
5. **Betting & Gaming** (2-8% and growing) - The emerging frontier

As you work through this module, pay attention to how these streams interconnect. An investment in one area often creates ripple effects across the entire ecosystem‚Äîa principle that separates strategic sports business leaders from purely financial operators.

### Element 5: Media Rights Part 1 - The Dominance
**Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:**

```markdown
# Media Rights Part 1: The Dominance

Media rights‚Äîthe fees paid by broadcasters and streaming services to air games‚Äîrepresent the **largest revenue stream** for most professional leagues, typically accounting for **40-60% of total revenue**.

## Massive Deals Define the Landscape

These deals are massive: the NFL's current media rights contracts total **$110 billion over 11 years** ($10B/year), while the English Premier League generates over **$5 billion per year** from domestic and international broadcast rights. In Canada, Rogers Communications paid **$5.2 billion over 12 years** for NHL rights‚Äîthe largest media rights deal in Canadian sports history.

## Why Sports Command Premium Value

The economic logic is straightforward: **sports content attracts large, engaged, live audiences**‚Äîa rarity in an era of on-demand entertainment. Advertisers pay premium rates because viewers can't fast-forward through commercials during live games.

**Key Economics:**
- **Cost per thousand viewers (CPM)** for premium sports: **$50-70**
- **CPM for scripted television:** **$15-25**
- **Premium multiplier:** Sports command **3-4√ó higher advertising rates**

Broadcasters generate revenue through two channels:
1. **Advertising sales** during games
2. **Carriage fees** - monthly fees cable companies pay to carry channels like ESPN or TSN

## Long-Term Stability

For leagues, broadcast deals provide **predictable, long-term revenue**:
- NHL's Canadian deal with Rogers: **12 years**
- NBA's U.S. deals: **9 years**
- NFL contracts: **11 years**

This stability allows teams to make long-term financial commitments like player contracts and facility investments. Unlike ticketing (variable based on performance) or sponsorship (dependent on corporate health), media rights provide guaranteed cash flow.

### Element 7: Media Rights Part 2 - The Streaming Wars
**Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:**

```markdown
# Media Rights Part 2: The Streaming Wars

The rise of streaming has fundamentally disrupted sports media economics. Companies like Amazon, Apple, and DAZN have entered bidding wars, driving rights values higher while introducing new business models.

## Major Streaming Entries

**Tech Company Investments:**
- **Amazon:** NFL Thursday Night Football - **$1 billion/year**
- **Apple:** MLS - **$250 million/year**
- **Apple:** MLB Friday Night Baseball
- **DAZN:** Boxing, soccer, international sports

## How Streaming Differs from Traditional Broadcasting

Streaming platforms operate with fundamentally different economics:

| **Factor** | **Traditional TV** | **Streaming** |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Revenue model** | Advertising-dependent | Subscription-based |
| **Geographic reach** | Regional licensing | Global distribution |
| **Engagement data** | Aggregated ratings (Nielsen) | Detailed viewer analytics |
| **Profitability timeline** | Immediate ROI expectations | 3-5 year payback periods |

## The Hybrid Model Emerges

Leagues increasingly split rights packages to maximize total revenue:
- Sell traditional TV rights to one partner (NBC, ESPN)
- Sell streaming rights to another (Apple, Amazon)
- Create direct-to-consumer platforms (NBA League Pass, NHL.TV, NFL+)

This **"hybrid model"** hedges against uncertainty about the future of television while capturing value from both worlds.

## Strategic Value for Tech Companies

Why do tech companies pay premium prices for sports rights?

**Defensive Value (Traditional Broadcasters):**
- ESPN pays top dollar to prevent subscriber exodus
- Sports are the main reason many consumers keep cable subscriptions
- "Sports is the glue holding the bundle together"

**Offensive Value (Streaming Disruptors):**
- Amazon uses NFL to drive Prime subscriptions
- Apple uses MLS to establish credibility in sports
- Sports become the "killer app" attracting subscribers

The most sophisticated valuations consider **strategic fit**, not just immediate profitability. Sports rights help platforms achieve broader goals, justifying prices that seem economically irrational based on direct advertising or subscription revenue alone.
```

### Element 7: Infobox - Appointment Viewing Insight
```
Title: üì∫ Key Insight: "Appointment Viewing"

Sports are the last true appointment viewing‚Äîyou can't watch "later" without risking spoilers from social media. This creates predictable, simultaneous audiences (rare in 2024), premium advertising rates, subscription retention power, and cultural currency. This unique characteristic explains why sports rights command prices that seem economically irrational‚Äîuntil you understand their strategic defensive value for traditional broadcasters and offensive value for streaming disruptors.
```

### Element 9: Ticketing Part 1 - The Live Experience
**Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:**

```markdown
# Ticketing Part 1: The Live Experience

Ticketing and live event revenue‚Äîincluding ticket sales, premium seating, and in-venue spending‚Äîaccounts for **20-30% of total revenue** for most teams. Unlike media rights, which are negotiated at the league level and often shared, ticketing revenue is largely **local and team-controlled**.

## Variable Revenue Dynamics

Ticketing revenue fluctuates based on factors outside team control:

**Team Performance:**
- Playoff contention drives ticket demand
- Winning teams sell more season tickets
- Losing teams face empty seats and discounting

**Market Size Differences:**
- Toronto Maple Leafs sell out 18,500 seats at $150+ average
- Ottawa Senators struggle to fill 18,000 seats at $75 average
- Market population and corporate base matter immensely

**Opponent Quality:**
- Yankees vs. Red Sox sells out at premium prices
- Yankees vs. Orioles requires discounting
- Rivalry games command 2-3√ó normal prices

## Dynamic Pricing Revolution

Dynamic pricing‚Äîadjusting ticket prices based on demand‚Äîhas become standard practice. Prices fluctuate based on:

- **Opponent quality** (Lakers vs. Warriors vs. Pistons)
- **Team performance** (playoff contention increases demand)
- **Day of week** (weekend vs. weekday games)
- **Special events** (giveaways, jersey retirements, rivalry matchups)
- **Time to event** (last-minute purchases)

**Real Example:**
The Toronto Raptors might charge **$150** for a Tuesday game against Detroit, but **$400** for a Saturday game against the Lakers.

Technology platforms like SeatGeek, Ticketmaster, and proprietary systems analyze real-time demand, weather, team news, and historical data to optimize pricing **thousands of times per day**.

## Impact on Revenue

Over a full season, dynamic pricing can **increase ticketing revenue by 15-25%** compared to static pricing. This is particularly valuable for:
- Non-premium inventory (upper bowl seats)
- Midweek games against weak opponents
- Late-season games when playoff picture is clear

The key tradeoff: Maximizing short-term revenue vs. maintaining fan loyalty. Fans accustomed to $100 tickets who suddenly see $250 prices may feel exploited, harming long-term relationships.

### Element 11: Ticketing Part 2 - The Premium Seating Strategy
**Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:**

```markdown
# Ticketing Part 2: The Premium Seating Strategy

The evolution of stadium economics has shifted dramatically from a **"fill the seats"** model to a **"maximize per-capita revenue"** model. Modern venues are designed with tiered experiences that extract maximum value from affluent customers.

## Premium Seating Tiers

**Luxury Suites:**
- **$100,000-500,000 per season** (annual commitment)
- Private rooms with 12-24 seats
- Catering, dedicated waitstaff, private bathrooms
- Primarily sold to corporations for client entertainment

**Club Seats:**
- **$5,000-15,000 per seat per season**
- Exclusive lounges with upscale dining
- Premium sight lines (lower bowl, center ice/court)
- Individual seats, not full suites

**Courtside/Field Level:**
- **$500-2,000+ per game** for individual tickets
- Celebrity seating, visible on broadcasts
- Concierge service, meet-and-greet access
- Status symbol as much as viewing experience

## The Critical Economic Insight

Here's the revolutionary finding that transformed stadium design:

**Premium seating generates 40-50% of ticketing revenue despite representing only 10-15% of capacity.**

This explains why virtually every stadium renovation or new construction prioritizes premium inventory expansion. A new building isn't just about replacing old seats‚Äîit's about adding 20-30 luxury suites that each generate more revenue than 100 general admission seats combined.

## Personal Seat Licenses (PSLs)

Some teams sell **Personal Seat Licenses**‚Äîone-time fees (often $5,000-75,000) for the right to purchase season tickets in premium locations. PSLs generate massive upfront capital:

- **SoFi Stadium (Rams/Chargers):** Generated over **$600 million** from PSL sales
- Funds stadium construction without increasing team debt
- Controversial: Fans pay thousands just for the *right* to buy expensive tickets

## Beyond the Ticket: Gameday Spending

Total non-ticket revenue can reach **$40-50 per attendee**, including:

**Concessions:**
- Food and beverage: $10 beers, $8 hot dogs
- Premium catering in suites
- Average per-capita spending: **$15-30**

**Parking:**
- Premium parking: **$50-100 per game**
- General parking: **$20-40 per game**

**Merchandise:**
- In-venue retail shops
- Game-day only items (commemorative shirts, playoff gear)

This turns a $100 ticket into **$140-150 in total venue spending**‚Äîwhy teams view declining attendance as a crisis affecting the entire in-venue ecosystem, not just ticket sales.

### Element 14: Sponsorship - Brand Alignment and Activation
**Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:**

```markdown
# Sponsorship: Brand Alignment and Activation

Corporate sponsorship represents **15-25% of revenue** for most professional teams, with higher percentages in markets with deep-pocketed corporations. Unlike passive advertising, effective sponsorships create **brand associations through integrated experiences**.

## Naming Rights: Geographic Brand Ownership

Stadium and arena naming rights are the most visible (and valuable) sponsorship deals:

**Major Market Examples:**
- **Scotiabank Arena** (Toronto): ~$800 million over 20 years (**$40M/year**)
- **Chase Center** (Golden State Warriors): ~$300 million over 20 years (**$15M/year**)
- **Climate Pledge Arena** (Seattle Kraken): ~$200-300M over 15 years

Naming rights provide consistent brand exposure‚Äîmentioned in broadcasts, printed on tickets, embedded in digital content, and used in everyday conversation ("I'm going to Chase tonight"). It's **geographic brand ownership**, not just signage.

## Jersey and Uniform Sponsorship

The NBA pioneered jersey sponsorship in North America in 2017, allowing teams to sell a 2.5" x 2.5" patch on uniforms:

- **Golden State Warriors + Rakuten:** ~$20M/year
- **Los Angeles Lakers + Bibigo:** ~$12-14M/year
- **Boston Celtics + Vistaprint:** ~$7-10M/year

Jersey sponsorship is particularly valuable because:
1. **Guaranteed visibility** - Every broadcast shows the logo
2. **Fan adoption** - Replica jerseys carry sponsor brands into everyday life
3. **Global reach** - Highlights and social media amplify exposure worldwide

The NHL approved helmet sponsorship during COVID (2020-21), generating **$2-5 million per team annually**. Full jersey sponsorship is expected within 5-10 years.

## Category Partnerships

Most teams sell **category-exclusive partnerships**: "official beer," "official airline," "official bank." These deals range from **$500,000 to $10 million annually**.

**High-Value Categories:**
- Automotive, financial services, telecommunications
- Alcoholic beverages, airlines, insurance

Category deals bundle:
- In-venue signage and PA announcements
- Broadcast integrations ("This power play brought to you by...")
- Digital content and social media features
- Hospitality and premium seating access

## Activation: Beyond the Logo

The best sponsors **activate** beyond logos‚Äîcreating fan experiences that build positive associations:

‚ùå **Poor Activation:** Logo on a rink board. Fans barely notice.

‚úÖ **Great Activation:** Scotiabank's "Scene+ Night" at Leafs games‚Äîloyalty program integration, exclusive ticket offers, in-arena experiences. Fans associate Scotiabank with positive memories.

‚úÖ **Excellent Activation:** Delta's partnership with the Lakers includes exclusive lounges, travel content series, "Delta Deck" premium seating, and behind-the-scenes player content. Every touchpoint reinforces the brand-team connection.

The most sophisticated sponsors measure success through:
- **Brand awareness** (how many people saw/remembered the logo?)
- **Brand favorability** (did the sponsorship improve perception?)
- **Customer acquisition** (did we gain new customers?)
```

- Middle tiers: Event presence, digital integration
- Top tier: "Full brand integration" (high activation, high value)
- Examples at each tier (e.g., Scotiabank Scene+ Night = top tier)

### Element 15: Details - Sponsorship ROI Measurement
```
Title: How Sponsors Measure Success

[Expand for deeper understanding of sponsorship evaluation]

Sophisticated sponsors don't just count logo impressions. They measure three categories:

**1. Brand Awareness Metrics**
- Aided/unaided brand recall surveys
- Social media mentions and reach
- Media value equivalency (estimated PR value)
Example: "After 6 months of arena naming rights, unaided brand awareness increased from 22% to 38% in target market"

**2. Brand Favorability Tracking**
- Pre/post sponsorship sentiment analysis
- Net Promoter Score (NPS) changes
- Brand perception studies (quality, trust, innovation scores)
Example: "NHL partnership increased 'trustworthy' ratings by 12 points among males 25-54"

**3. Customer Acquisition Attribution**
- Promo code redemption (exclusive to sponsorship)
- Survey question: "How did you hear about us?"
- Cohort analysis (customers acquired during sponsorship period)
Example: "Suite hospitality events generated 47 qualified leads, 12 converted to customers, $480K revenue"

**Good Activation Example:**
Scotiabank's "Scene+ Night" at Leafs games‚Äîintegrates loyalty program with ticket offers and in-arena experiences. Tracks Scene+ sign-ups, redemptions, and spending lift.

**Poor Activation Example:**
Logo on rink board with no activation. No way to attribute business impact beyond "people saw it."
```

### Element 16: Merchandising & Betting - Established and Emerging Streams
**Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:**

```markdown
# Merchandising & Betting: Established and Emerging Streams

## Merchandising: Brand Extension

Merchandising and licensing revenue represents **5-10% of revenue** for most teams. Professional leagues take different approaches:

**Centralized Model (NFL, NHL, MLB):**
- League office manages all licensing
- Revenue pooled and distributed equally to all teams
- Protects small-market teams from imbalance

**Decentralized Model (European Soccer):**
- Teams control their own merchandise rights
- Popular clubs generate 10-20√ó more than smaller clubs
- Rewards brand-building but creates wealth disparity

**Key Revenue Drivers:**
- **Championship runs:** Sales increase **200-400%** during playoffs
- **Star acquisitions:** LeBron's Lakers trade = **$1M+ in jersey sales within hours**
- **New designs:** NBA "City Edition" jerseys generate **$100M+ annually**

Digital commerce has transformed the economics‚Äîteams can test designs instantly, collect customer data, and sell globally. The Toronto Raptors ship merchandise to **85+ countries** through their online store.

---

## Betting & Gaming: The Emerging Frontier

Sports betting represents the **newest and fastest-growing revenue stream**, currently **2-8% of revenue** but growing **30-40% year-over-year**.

### Legalization's Explosive Growth

**Timeline:**
- **2018:** U.S. Supreme Court strikes down federal betting ban (PASPA)
- **2018:** Legal in 8 U.S. states
- **2021:** Canada legalizes single-game betting (August 2021)
- **2024:** Legal in **38+ U.S. states** covering **70%+ of population**

Global sports betting market: **$200+ billion annually**.

### How Leagues Monetize Betting

**1. Official Partner Designations ($50-200M/year):**
FanDuel, DraftKings, BetMGM pay for "official betting partner" status, providing legitimacy and marketing access.

**2. Data Licensing ($10-50M/year):**
Leagues sell real-time game data essential for live betting odds‚Äîplayer tracking, injury reports, game statistics.

**3. Media Integration:**
Betting odds displayed in broadcasts, betting-focused content, stadium signage and promotions.

### Strategic Value Beyond Revenue

Betting fundamentally changes **fan engagement**:
- Fans with bets watch **30-40% more sports content**
- Games between weak teams gain interest through betting
- In-game betting keeps fans engaged throughout entire games
- Mobile app usage drives valuable first-party data

### Risks

**Game Integrity:** Player corruption, match fixing, inside information leaks
**Problem Gambling:** Addiction concerns, especially among younger users

Despite risks, leagues have decided betting integration is inevitable and preferable to regulate directly rather than leave to black markets. The engagement benefits‚Äîincreased viewership, mobile app usage, sponsor value‚Äîmake betting a strategic priority.

### Element 17: Infobox - Premium Seat Economics
```
Title: üíé Key Insight: Premium Seat Economics

Premium seating represents only 10-15% of total venue capacity but generates 40-50% of total ticketing revenue. Luxury suites ($100K-500K per season), club seats ($5K-15K per seat), and courtside/field level tickets ($500-2,000+ per game) command exponential premiums over general admission seating. This revolutionary insight transformed modern stadium design‚Äîvirtually every renovation or new construction prioritizes premium inventory expansion because 20-30 new luxury suites generate more revenue than 2,000 upper bowl seats combined.
```

### Element 18: Revenue Interdependence - The Ecosystem Principle
**Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:**

```markdown
# Revenue Interdependence: The Ecosystem Principle

The critical insight that distinguishes expert sports business analysts from novices: **Revenue streams don't exist in isolation‚Äîthey form an ecosystem.**

## The Connor McDavid Example

Consider the Edmonton Oilers signing Connor McDavid to an **8-year, $100 million contract** ($12.5M per year). Direct revenue from his impact:

**Direct Effects:**
- Ticket sales increase: **~$5M per year**
- Merchandise sales spike: **~$3M per year**
- Total direct revenue: **~$8M per year**

At first glance, this seems like a **losing investment**‚Äîpaying $12.5M to generate $8M is terrible math.

But this analysis misses the **ecosystem amplification**:

**Indirect Effects:**
- **Media rights value increases:** TV ratings improve, strengthening negotiating position for next rights deal (**+$10M annually** over contract life)
- **Sponsorship renewals:** Corporate partners pay premium to associate with generational talent (**+$5M annually** in increased sponsorship fees)
- **Playoff revenue:** Better team performance = playoff games = **$15-20M** in additional revenue per deep run
- **Franchise valuation:** Star player increases team's enterprise value by **$50-100M**, benefiting eventual sale
- **Betting engagement:** McDavid prop bets and game interest drive betting partnership value (**+$2M annually**)

**Total ecosystem value:** **$30-40M+ annually**‚Äîfar exceeding the $12.5M salary cost.

## Why Teams Overpay for Stars

This explains seemingly irrational decisions:
- New York Rangers trading for Patrick Kane at deadline despite not contending
- Toronto Maple Leafs re-signing Auston Matthews to $13.25M despite never winning playoff round
- Los Angeles Lakers trading for Anthony Davis and immediately extending him

They're not paying for on-ice/on-court performance alone‚Äîthey're investing in **ecosystem amplification** across media, sponsorship, merchandise, and brand value.

## The Strategic Question

The most sophisticated sports organizations don't manage revenue streams independently. They ask:

**"How does this investment cascade through our ecosystem?"**

Examples:
- Building a new arena ‚Üí ticketing + sponsorship + media production + betting infrastructure
- Signing a star ‚Üí ticketing + merchandise + media + sponsorship + betting
- Legalizing betting ‚Üí direct betting revenue + increased viewership + app data + sponsor value

## The Principle

**"Investment in one revenue stream amplifies others."**

Understanding this ecosystem thinking is the foundation of strategic sports business decision-making. Throughout this course, keep asking: **How do these streams interconnect? What decisions create positive cascades?**
```

- **6 short text blocks** (2-5 minutes each) instead of one long block
- **Visual breaks** every 2-4 elements
- **Strategic callouts** highlight key insights
- **Optional depth** (Details accordion) for interested students

**Student Experience:**
1. Read brief intro (2 min)
2. Watch overview video (2 min)
3. Scan visual reference (list + table)
4. Read about media rights (3-4 min) + see callout
5. Read about ticketing (4-5 min) + see visual diagram
6. Read about sponsorship (4-5 min) + optional deep dive
7. Read about merchandising/betting (4-5 min) + see stats callout
8. Read final synthesis (3-4 min) + see ecosystem diagram

**Total Time:** ~20 minutes (same as original)
**Engagement:** Much higher due to varied delivery

**UDL Principles:**
- ‚úÖ Multiple means of representation (text, video, visual, interactive)
- ‚úÖ Strategic use of emphasis (infoboxes, callouts)
- ‚úÖ Optional progressive disclosure (Details accordion)
- ‚úÖ Digestible chunks (no single element over 5 minutes)

Title: üí° Strategy Hints (Open if you're stuck)

Not sure how to approach this? Here are some strategic considerations:

**Diversification:**
Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Even high-growth streams have risks.
A balanced portfolio can weather market changes better.

**Media Rights:**
High revenue potential but requires long-term contracts. Once you commit, you're
locked in. Make sure you're negotiating from strength (winning teams get better deals).

**Ticketing:**
Capacity-limited. You can only sell so many seats. Premium seating and dynamic
pricing can increase yield, but there's a ceiling. Consider this a stable base,
not a growth engine.

**Sponsorship:**
Relationship-dependent. Building strong partnerships takes time but can be very
profitable. Brand alignment matters - don't just chase the biggest check.

**Betting/Gaming:**
High growth potential but regulatory risk. Early movers can capture value, but
stay flexible in case laws change.

**Key Question:**
Which streams create synergies? (Hint: Better players ‚Üí better content ‚Üí higher
media rights ‚Üí more resources for players...)
```

**Design Rationale:**
- **iFrame widget** provides hands-on, experiential learning (UDL engagement, Application level)
- **Infobox** clearly frames the task and connects to MLOs (QM clarity)
- **Reflection prompt** encourages metacognition and transfer (deeper learning)
- **AI Chat** offers adaptive support based on student needs (UDL scaffolding)
- **Details** provides hints without giving answers (progressive disclosure for struggling learners)
- Multiple paths to success - no single "right" strategy (UDL choice)
- Directly supports MLO 1.3 (evaluating growth potential and risks) through authentic practice

### Details - Rubric Examples Content:
```
Title: Rubric Details & Example Excerpts

[Expand to see evaluation criteria and examples]

## Revenue Stream Analysis (10 points)

**Excellent (9-10 pts):**
"Demonstrates sophisticated understanding of at least 3 revenue streams, explaining
not just what they are but how they interconnect. For example, shows how media
rights value depends on competitive talent, which requires revenue sharing to
maintain balance."

**Example Excerpt:**
"Media rights generate 55% of NHL revenue, but this value depends entirely on
competitive balance maintained through revenue sharing. Without sharing, wealthy
teams would monopolize talent, creating predictable outcomes that decrease media
value for all. The Canucks benefit from shared national media revenue ($XX million)
but must compete for scarce local sponsorship dollars..."

**Proficient (7-8 pts):**
"Accurately describes 3+ revenue streams with some analysis of characteristics.
May miss some interdependencies or deeper implications."

**Developing (5-6 pts):**
"Lists revenue streams but provides limited analysis. May treat streams as
independent rather than interconnected."

**Needs Improvement (0-4 pts):**
"Describes fewer than 3 streams, or descriptions are inaccurate or incomplete."

---

## Investment Factors (10 points)

**Excellent (9-10 pts):**
"Identifies 2-3 specific, defensible investment factors supported by evidence.
Factors show strategic thinking and business acumen."

**Example Excerpt:**
"Two factors would drive my investment decision: (1) Revenue sharing stability‚Äî
leagues with proven revenue sharing models (like the NFL) protect downside risk,
and (2) Emerging stream potential‚Äîteams with rights to betting partnerships and
digital content can capture high-growth revenue outside traditional sharing pools."

**Proficient (7-8 pts):**
"Identifies 2-3 reasonable factors with some justification. May lack specificity
or deep supporting evidence."

```
Title: üéØ Week 1 Key Takeaways

You've completed your introduction to sport revenue ecosystems! Here's what you
should take away:

‚úì Revenue streams are interdependent, not independent
‚úì Sport's business model is unique‚Äîcompetition on field, collaboration on economics
‚úì Revenue sharing creates competitive balance but constrains entrepreneurial upside
‚úì Growth opportunities exist at the frontier (betting, streaming, international)

This foundation prepares you for Week 2, where we'll dive deep into media rights
and fan engagement monetization‚Äîtwo of the highest-value and fastest-changing
revenue streams.

Well done! üëè
```

### Text Content - Group Marketing Project Connection:
```
## Connecting to Your Group Marketing Project

As you begin thinking about your Group Marketing Project (60% of final grade),
consider how this week's content applies:

Your task will be to develop a comprehensive marketing plan for a sport organization.
Revenue strategy is the foundation of any marketing plan‚Äîyou can't make strategic
marketing decisions without understanding revenue generation and constraints.

Questions to consider as you form your project team and select your organization:
‚Ä¢ Which revenue streams offer the most growth potential for your chosen organization?
‚Ä¢ How does revenue sharing (if applicable) constrain or enable marketing strategy?
‚Ä¢ What emerging revenue streams (betting, NFTs, metaverse) could your organization leverage?
‚Ä¢ How can marketing investments increase multiple revenue streams simultaneously?

We'll explore these questions throughout the course. By Week 5, you'll integrate
everything into a cohesive marketing strategy.

Start thinking about project teams and organization selection. More details in
the Project Guide (available on course homepage).
```

### Text Content - Week 2 Preview:
```
## Looking Ahead: Week 2 - Media, Content & Fan Engagement

Next week, we go deep on the largest and most dynamic revenue stream: media rights.

You'll explore:
‚Ä¢ How media rights are valued and negotiated
‚Ä¢ The shift from traditional broadcasting to streaming
‚Ä¢ Fan engagement strategies and monetization
‚Ä¢ Major deals analysis (e.g., Rogers/NHL $5.2 billion)

Executive Leader: [Name, Title]
Core Case: Rogers Communications and the NHL Rights Deal

**PLUS: Anchor Project Launch!** üéØ
Week 2 marks the beginning of your course-long Anchor Project (60% of final grade).
You'll form teams of 5-6 students and select a sport property to analyze over the
remaining weeks. Start thinking about potential teammates and organizations that
interest you!

**Estimated Time Commitment:** Week 2 = 7-9 hours total (includes 2-3 hours for team
formation and property selection)

Get ready for another intensive week of learning! See you in Week 2.
