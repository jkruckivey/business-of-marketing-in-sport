### Text Content (week1-intro.docx):
```
The Business of Sport: A Unique Revenue Ecosystem

Professional sport operates unlike any other industry. Teams compete on the field
but must collaborate financially to maintain competitive balance. Revenue streams
are interdependent—strong media rights deals fund player salaries, which attract
talent, which creates compelling content, which increases media value.

This week, we explore the five major revenue streams that power professional sport:
media rights, ticketing and attendance, sponsorship and partnerships, merchandising,
and the emerging betting/gaming sector. We'll examine not just how money flows IN,
but how it flows BETWEEN stakeholders through complex revenue sharing arrangements.

You'll learn why the NFL shares 60% of all revenue equally among teams, while
European soccer operates on a more entrepreneurial model. You'll understand why
the NBA invested billions in creating its own streaming infrastructure, and why
betting legalization fundamentally changes sport's economic equation.
```

### Tiles Content:

**Tile 1 - Title:** "Media Rights"

Revenue streams don't exist in isolation. Strong media deals fund higher player

media value. Betting partnerships drive fan engagement, increasing ticketing and
sponsorship value. Understanding these connections is critical to revenue strategy.

Think of it as an ecosystem, not a portfolio.

### Details Content:
```
Title: 💡 Strategy Hints (Open if you're stuck)

Not sure how to approach this? Here are some strategic considerations:

**Diversification:**
Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Even high-growth streams have risks.
A balanced portfolio can weather market changes better.

**Media Rights:**
High revenue potential but requires long-term contracts. Once you commit, you're
locked in. Make sure you're negotiating from strength (winning teams get better deals).

**Ticketing:**
Capacity-limited. You can only sell so many seats. Premium seating and dynamic
pricing can increase yield, but there's a ceiling. Consider this a stable base,
not a growth engine.

**Sponsorship:**
Relationship-dependent. Building strong partnerships takes time but can be very
profitable. Brand alignment matters - don't just chase the biggest check.

**Betting/Gaming:**
High growth potential but regulatory risk. Early movers can capture value, but
stay flexible in case laws change.

**Key Question:**
Which streams create synergies? (Hint: Better players → better content → higher
media rights → more resources for players...)
```

**Design Rationale:**
- **iFrame widget** provides hands-on, experiential learning (UDL engagement, Application level)
- **Infobox** clearly frames the task and connects to MLOs (QM clarity)
- **Reflection prompt** encourages metacognition and transfer (deeper learning)
- **AI Chat** offers adaptive support based on student needs (UDL scaffolding)
- **Details** provides hints without giving answers (progressive disclosure for struggling learners)
- Multiple paths to success - no single "right" strategy (UDL choice)
- Directly supports MLO 1.3 (evaluating growth potential and risks) through authentic practice

Title: Rubric Details & Example Excerpts

[Expand to see evaluation criteria and examples]

## Revenue Stream Analysis (10 points)

**Excellent (9-10 pts):**
"Demonstrates sophisticated understanding of at least 3 revenue streams, explaining
not just what they are but how they interconnect. For example, shows how media
rights value depends on competitive talent, which requires revenue sharing to
maintain balance."

**Example Excerpt:**
"Media rights generate 55% of NHL revenue, but this value depends entirely on
competitive balance maintained through revenue sharing. Without sharing, wealthy
teams would monopolize talent, creating predictable outcomes that decrease media
value for all. The Canucks benefit from shared national media revenue ($XX million)
but must compete for scarce local sponsorship dollars..."

**Proficient (7-8 pts):**
"Accurately describes 3+ revenue streams with some analysis of characteristics.
May miss some interdependencies or deeper implications."

**Developing (5-6 pts):**
"Lists revenue streams but provides limited analysis. May treat streams as
independent rather than interconnected."

**Needs Improvement (0-4 pts):**
"Describes fewer than 3 streams, or descriptions are inaccurate or incomplete."

---

## Investment Factors (10 points)

**Excellent (9-10 pts):**
"Identifies 2-3 specific, defensible investment factors supported by evidence.
Factors show strategic thinking and business acumen."

**Example Excerpt:**
"Two factors would drive my investment decision: (1) Revenue sharing stability—
leagues with proven revenue sharing models (like the NFL) protect downside risk,
and (2) Emerging stream potential—teams with rights to betting partnerships and
digital content can capture high-growth revenue outside traditional sharing pools."

**Proficient (7-8 pts):**
"Identifies 2-3 reasonable factors with some justification. May lack specificity
or deep supporting evidence."

### AI Chat Widget Configuration:
- **Widget Name:** "Writing Assistant"
- **System Prompt:** "You are a helpful writing coach for MBA students. Provide feedback and suggestions on business memo writing, structure, and analysis. Do NOT write content for students.

If students ask you to write their memo, redirect them to develop their own analysis with your guidance."
- **Welcome Message:** "Need help with your reflection memo? I can help you organize your thoughts, strengthen your arguments, or improve your business writing. What would you like to work on?"
- **Show System Prompt:** No

**Design Rationale:**

- **Infobox** provides crystal-clear instructions and expectations (QM Standard 3)
- **Rubric** ensures transparent, consistent evaluation (QM Standard 3, UDL clarity)
- **AI grading** enables timely feedback at scale while maintaining rigor
- **Details** makes rubric fully transparent (students know exactly what's expected)
- **AI Chat** provides writing support without doing the work for students (UDL scaffolding)

### Infobox Content:
```
Title: 🎯 Week 1 Key Takeaways

You've completed your introduction to sport revenue ecosystems! Here's what you
should take away:

✓ Revenue streams are interdependent, not independent
✓ Sport's business model is unique—competition on field, collaboration on economics
✓ Revenue sharing creates competitive balance but constrains entrepreneurial upside
✓ Growth opportunities exist at the frontier (betting, streaming, international)

This foundation prepares you for Week 2, where we'll dive deep into media rights
and fan engagement monetization—two of the highest-value and fastest-changing
revenue streams.

Well done! 👏
```

### Text Content - Group Marketing Project Connection:
```
## Connecting to Your Group Marketing Project

As you begin thinking about your Group Marketing Project (60% of final grade),
consider how this week's content applies:

Your task will be to develop a comprehensive marketing plan for a sport organization.
Revenue strategy is the foundation of any marketing plan—you can't make strategic
marketing decisions without understanding revenue generation and constraints.

Questions to consider as you form your project team and select your organization:
• Which revenue streams offer the most growth potential for your chosen organization?
• How does revenue sharing (if applicable) constrain or enable marketing strategy?
• What emerging revenue streams (betting, NFTs, metaverse) could your organization leverage?
• How can marketing investments increase multiple revenue streams simultaneously?

We'll explore these questions throughout the course. By Week 5, you'll integrate
everything into a cohesive marketing strategy.

Start thinking about project teams and organization selection. More details in
the Project Guide (available on course homepage).
```

### Text Content - Week 2 Preview:
```
## Looking Ahead: Week 2 - Media, Content & Fan Engagement

Next week, we go deep on the largest and most dynamic revenue stream: media rights.

You'll explore:
• How media rights are valued and negotiated
• The shift from traditional broadcasting to streaming
• Fan engagement strategies and monetization
• Major deals analysis (e.g., Rogers/NHL $5.2 billion)

Executive Leader: [Name, Title]
Core Case: Rogers Communications and the NHL Rights Deal

**PLUS: Anchor Project Launch!** 🎯
Week 2 marks the beginning of your course-long Anchor Project (60% of final grade).
You'll form teams of 5-6 students and select a sport property to analyze over the
remaining weeks. Start thinking about potential teammates and organizations that
interest you!

**Estimated Time Commitment:** Week 2 = 7-9 hours total (includes 2-3 hours for team
formation and property selection)

Get ready for another intensive week of learning! See you in Week 2.
