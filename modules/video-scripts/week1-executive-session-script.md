### Opening Segment (0:00-15:00) - Introduction to Revenue Streams

**[ON-SCREEN: Ivey Business School & Bell Media logos]**

**[CAMERA: Wide shot of executive in professional setting]**

**INSTRUCTOR (VOICE-OVER):**
Welcome to Week 1 of The Business of Sports Marketing. This week, we're diving into revenue ecosystems—the unique ways professional sports generate and distribute income. To guide us, we have [Executive Name], [Title] at [Bell Media/TSN], with over [X] years of experience negotiating media rights, building sponsorship partnerships, and shaping the future of sports broadcasting in Canada.

[Executive Name] has been at the table for deals worth over $[X] billion and has seen firsthand how revenue streams interconnect to create—or destroy—value. Let's hear their perspective.

**[CAMERA: Cut to medium close-up of executive]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
Thanks for having me. I'm excited to share what we've learned at [TSN/Bell Media] about how sports properties generate revenue—and why it's fundamentally different from any other business.

Let me start with a story. In [Year], we were negotiating a major rights deal for [Property]. On paper, the numbers didn't make sense. We'd be paying [X%] more per game than the previous contract, and traditional metrics—viewership, CPM, ad load—didn't justify it. But we signed anyway.

Why? Because sports revenue isn't linear. It's an ecosystem. That rights deal wasn't just about advertising revenue. It was about:
- Defending our subscriber base (cable/satellite)
- Building our streaming platform (TSN Direct)
- Creating sponsorship inventory
- Anchoring our brand positioning
- And yes, generating ad revenue

When you understand that interconnection—that's when you understand sports business.

**[ON-SCREEN GRAPHIC: 5 Revenue Streams - Media Rights, Ticketing, Sponsorship, Merchandising, Betting/Gaming]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
So let's break down the five major revenue streams in professional sports:

**1. Media Rights** - This is where I spend most of my time. Broadcasting and streaming deals. For major leagues, this is 40-60% of total revenue. Think of it as the foundation.

**2. Ticketing & Live Events** - Gate receipts, premium seating, hospitality suites. This is the original revenue stream—sports started here. Still 20-30% of revenue, but capacity-constrained.

**3. Sponsorship & Partnerships** - Corporate partners who want to align their brand with your property. Naming rights, jersey sponsors, official partners. About 15-25% of revenue, relationship-driven.

**4. Merchandising & Licensing** - Jerseys, hats, video games, collectibles. Centralized in many leagues. 5-10% of revenue, tied to popularity.

**5. Betting & Gaming** - The newest and fastest-growing stream. Sports betting partnerships, official data rights, fantasy sports. Currently 2-8% but growing rapidly.

**[CAMERA: Medium shot, executive leaning forward]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
Now here's what makes sports unique: **these streams are interdependent**.

If I invest in better on-air talent for our broadcasts, that improves the viewing experience, which increases ratings, which makes sponsors want to be associated with us, which funds better production quality, which attracts more viewers.

Or look at it from a team perspective: Strong local attendance creates a better atmosphere, which makes games more exciting to watch on TV, which increases media rights value, which funds higher player salaries, which attracts better talent, which creates more compelling games, which increases attendance.

**It's a flywheel. Not a portfolio.**

**[ON-SCREEN: Animation showing interconnected revenue streams]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
Let me give you a Canadian example. The Toronto Maple Leafs haven't won a Stanley Cup since 1967—before many of you were born. Yet they're consistently one of the most valuable franchises in the NHL. Why?

They've built a revenue ecosystem that doesn't entirely depend on on-ice success:
- Sellout crowds at premium prices (highest ticket revenue in NHL)
- Strong local media rights (regional broadcasts command premium CPM)
- Deep-pocketed corporate sponsors (Toronto's corporate base)
- Merchandise sales (massive fan base across Canada)
- Real estate assets (Scotiabank Arena hosts 200+ events/year)

That's ecosystem thinking. Success in one area funds investment in others.

**[PAUSE FOR REFLECTION]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
As we go through this session, I want you to think like a CFO or a media executive. When you evaluate a revenue opportunity, ask:
1. What's the direct revenue?
2. What's the indirect impact on other streams?
3. What's the long-term strategic value?

Often, the second and third questions matter more than the first.

Alright, let's dive deeper into each stream...

---

### Section 1 (15:00-35:00) - Media Rights Deep Dive

**[ON-SCREEN: Section Title - "Media Rights: The Foundation"]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
Media rights are the backbone of professional sports revenue. In Canada, hockey drives everything. In the U.S., it's football. Globally, it's soccer. But the principles are the same.

**[ON-SCREEN GRAPHIC: Media Rights Value Drivers]**

Let me explain how we value sports content at [Bell Media/TSN]:

**Driver #1: Audience Size & Demographics**

We're not just buying eyeballs—we're buying the **right** eyeballs. Sports deliver:
- Males 18-49 (historically hardest demographic to reach)
- High-income households (sports fans skew affluent)
- Live, engaged audiences (not second-screening or fast-forwarding)

When we bid on NHL rights, we're modeling: How many viewers? What's the demographic profile? What's the CPM (cost per thousand viewers) we can charge advertisers?

For premium matchups—Maple Leafs vs. Canadiens, Saturday night Hockey Night in Canada—we can charge $40-60 CPM. Compare that to primetime dramas at $15-25 CPM.

**[EXAMPLE ON-SCREEN: CPM Comparison Chart]**

**Driver #2: Exclusivity & Competition**

This is where negotiation gets fascinating. Exclusive rights cost 2-3x more than non-exclusive. Why would we pay that premium?

Because exclusivity creates **market power**. If you want to watch NHL hockey in Canada, you have to come through us (and our competitors who also hold rights). That's leverage.

When Rogers outbid us for national NHL rights in 2013—$5.2 billion over 12 years—they were betting on exclusivity creating subscriber retention for Sportsnet. We'll talk more about whether that bet paid off when we analyze that case later in the course.

**Driver #3: Content Volume & Scheduling Flexibility**

The NHL plays 82 games per team, 1,312 games per season. The NFL plays 17 games per team, 272 games per season. Which is more valuable?

Trick question—depends what you're optimizing for.

**NHL advantages:**
- More inventory to monetize (more games = more ad impressions)
- Consistent programming (we can build audience habits)
- Shoulder content opportunities (pre-game, post-game shows)

**NFL advantages:**
- Scarcity creates event status (every game matters)
- Higher per-game viewership (concentrated audience)
- Appointment viewing (Sunday ritual)

At TSN, we've built our brand on volume—NHL, CFL, March Madness, tennis, curling. We're a 24/7 sports destination. That's our strategy.

**Driver #4: Brand Alignment & Sponsorship Activation**

This is the ecosystem effect I mentioned. Media rights aren't just about ad revenue—they're about creating sponsorship inventory.

When we broadcast the NHL, we're not just selling 30-second commercial spots. We're selling:
- In-game branding (ice boards, glass, helmets)
- Broadcast integrations ("This power play brought to you by...")
- Studio show sponsorships
- Digital extensions (sponsored content, social media)
- Hospitality and B2B opportunities

Those sponsorships subsidize our rights costs. A $400 million/year rights deal might generate $100-150 million/year in sponsorship revenue that's directly tied to holding those rights.

**[PAUSE]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
Let me pause here and address the elephant in the room: **Are sports rights overvalued?**

Financially, in isolation, often yes. Many rights deals lose money on a pure P&L basis for the first 5-7 years.

But strategically, they're often undervalued. Here's why:

**[ON-SCREEN: Strategic Value of Sports Rights]**

**For Traditional Broadcasters (like Bell Media):**
- **Subscriber Defense:** Sports rights keep people from cutting the cord. Our internal data shows households with sports packages have 40% lower churn rates.
- **Ad Sales Leverage:** Sports inventory is the most valuable. It subsidizes our entire ad sales operation.
- **Brand Halo:** Being "home of the NHL" or "official broadcaster" elevates our entire brand.

**For Streaming Platforms (like DAZN, Amazon):**
- **Subscriber Acquisition:** Sports are the #1 driver of streaming sign-ups. Amazon Prime added millions of subscribers with NFL Thursday Night Football.
- **Engagement & Retention:** Sports fans use apps more frequently, driving habitual platform usage.
- **International Expansion:** Global sports rights (Premier League, UEFA Champions League) drive geographic growth.

So when you see a "crazy" rights deal—ask what the strategic play is. It's rarely just about ad revenue.

**[ON-SCREEN: Case Preview - Rogers NHL Deal]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
Next week, you'll analyze the Rogers $5.2B NHL deal in detail. Spoiler: It didn't work out as planned. We'll discuss why—and what they should have done differently. But I'll give you a hint: They overestimated subscriber defense and underestimated cord-cutting acceleration.

**[TRANSITION]**

Alright, let's move from media to the second major stream: ticketing and live events...

---

### Section 2 (35:00-50:00) - Sponsorship and Partnerships

**[ON-SCREEN: Section Title - "Sponsorship: Brand Alignment & Activation"]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
Sponsorship is the most relationship-driven revenue stream. You can't just "turn it on" like you can sell more tickets or negotiate a media deal. It requires long-term partner cultivation.

Let me share how we think about sponsorships at Bell—because we're both a media company (buying sports rights) and a potential sponsor (Bell could sponsor a team or league).

**[ON-SCREEN GRAPHIC: Sponsorship Value Pyramid]**

**Tier 1: Naming Rights & Title Sponsorships**

These are the premium, high-visibility partnerships:
- Scotiabank Arena (Toronto - $800M over 20 years)
- Canadian Tire Centre (Ottawa)
- Tim Hortons NHL Heritage Classics

These deals are about brand **ubiquity**. Every time someone says "I'm going to the game at Scotiabank Arena," that's a brand impression. Millions of impressions over 20 years.

For sponsors, the math is: Brand value creation vs. cost. If you're paying $40M/year for naming rights, you need to generate >$40M in brand lift to justify it. How do you measure that? Marketing mix modeling, brand tracking studies, customer surveys.

Spoiler: It's imperfect science. That's why these deals are often driven by executive relationships and brand prestige as much as ROI.

**Tier 2: Category Sponsorships**

"Official Beer of the NHL" (Molson Canadian)
"Official Airline of the Toronto Raptors" (Air Canada)
"Official Quick Service Restaurant of the CFL" (Mary Brown's)

These partnerships create **category exclusivity**. Competitors can't sponsor. That's valuable if you're trying to block a rival.

From the league/team perspective, you're selling access to:
- Logo placement (in-venue, broadcast, digital)
- Promotional rights ("Proud partner of...")
- Activation opportunities (fan contests, giveaways, experiences)
- B2B hospitality (suite access, tickets for client entertainment)

**Tier 3: Activation Partners**

These are smaller deals focused on fan engagement:
- In-game promotions ("Shoot the puck, win a car")
- Social media campaigns
- Community programs (grassroots sports sponsorships)

The value here is **authentic engagement**. Brands that activate well—creating memorable fan experiences—get more ROI than brands that just stick a logo on a board.

**[EXAMPLE]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
Let me give you an example of great activation vs. poor activation:

**Great Activation:** Scotiabank's "Scene+ Night" at Leafs games. They tie their loyalty program to exclusive ticket offers, in-arena experiences, and points for purchases. Fans associate Scotiabank with positive experiences, not just a logo.

**Poor Activation:** [Generic insurance company] buys a rink board. No fan engagement. No memorable experiences. Just a static logo. Low ROI.

The difference? **Strategic integration** vs. transactional sponsorship.

**[ON-SCREEN: Sponsorship ROI Framework]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
How do sponsors measure ROI? Three common approaches:

**1. Media Value Equivalency (MVE)**
Calculate the "advertising value" of logo impressions. If your logo appeared in 500 broadcasts reaching 10M viewers, what would that cost in ad buys? Divide by sponsorship cost = ROI ratio.

Limitation: Assumes a logo is as effective as a commercial. It's not.

**2. Brand Lift Studies**
Survey consumers before and after sponsorship activation. Measure changes in brand awareness, favorability, purchase intent. Attribute lift to sponsorship.

Limitation: Expensive, hard to isolate sponsorship from other marketing.

**3. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**
Track customers acquired through sponsorship activations (promo codes, exclusive offers). Calculate CAC vs. other channels.

Best practice: Most sophisticated sponsors use a combination of all three.

**[PAUSE]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
One trend I'm seeing: **Brands are shifting from passive sponsorship to active partnerships.**

Instead of just buying a logo, brands want:
- Co-created content (Bell Media Originals featuring team content)
- Data access (anonymized fan insights for targeting)
- Integrated experiences (app features, loyalty program tie-ins)

This creates more value for both sides—but requires deeper collaboration.

**[TRANSITION]**

Let's move to our third stream: ticketing and live events—where sports started...

---

### Section 3 (50:00-65:00) - Ticketing & Live Events

**[ON-SCREEN: Section Title - "Ticketing: The Live Experience"]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
Ticketing is the oldest and most straightforward revenue stream—but it's evolved dramatically.

**[ON-SCREEN: Evolution of Ticketing]**

**Phase 1: Fixed Pricing (Pre-2000s)**
Season tickets, single-game tickets, same price for every game. Simple, predictable, but left money on the table.

**Phase 2: Variable Pricing (2000s-2010s)**
Recognized that Leafs vs. Habs draws more demand than Leafs vs. Coyotes. Priced accordingly. Capture more revenue without alienating fans.

**Phase 3: Dynamic Pricing (2010s-Present)**
Real-time price adjustments based on demand signals:
- Team performance (winning streak → prices up)
- Opponent quality (star players → prices up)
- Inventory levels (few seats left → prices up)
- External factors (weather, holidays, local events)

This is airline pricing applied to sports. Sophisticated teams use algorithms to optimize yield.

**Phase 4: Experience-Based Pricing (Emerging)**
Premium seating isn't just about seat location anymore—it's about the **experience**:
- All-inclusive food & beverage
- Exclusive lounges and club access
- Meet-and-greets with players
- Personalized service (dedicated concierge)

Some teams generate 40-50% of ticketing revenue from premium seating that represents only 10-15% of capacity.

**[EXAMPLE]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
The Toronto Raptors (owned by MLSE, same ownership as Leafs) have "Courtside Club" seats:
- $10,000-15,000 per seat per season
- All-inclusive premium dining
- Private entrance and security
- Access to exclusive events

For context, upper bowl season tickets might be $2,000-3,000. That's a 5x price premium for a marginally better view—but a dramatically better experience.

The insight? **Affluent fans will pay for luxury and exclusivity.** Capture that willingness to pay.

**[ON-SCREEN: Ticketing Revenue Optimization Strategies]**

**Strategy #1: Segment Your Inventory**

Don't treat all seats equally:
- **Premium seating:** High price, low volume, high margin
- **Season tickets:** Moderate price, predictable revenue, loyal base
- **Single-game tickets:** Variable price, fills remaining inventory
- **Group sales:** Discounted price, fills weak games, builds fan base
- **Dynamic pricing:** Captures surge demand

Each segment serves a different business objective.

**Strategy #2: Maximize Non-Ticket Revenue**

The real money isn't tickets—it's what fans spend once they're in the building:
- **Concessions:** $10 beer, $8 hot dog (50-70% margin)
- **Parking:** $30-50 per vehicle (often outsourced but still revenue)
- **Merchandise:** Game-day impulse purchases (jerseys, hats, souvenirs)

Smart teams design their venues to maximize this "per-cap" (per capita) spending:
- More concession locations (reduce lines = more purchases)
- Premium offerings (craft beer, gourmet food = higher check sizes)
- Cashless venues (frictionless spending = higher conversion)

Some NBA teams generate $40-50 per attendee in non-ticket revenue. Over a 41-game home schedule with 18,000 fans per game, that's $30-37 million.

**Strategy #3: Leverage Scarcity & FOMO**

The Toronto Maple Leafs sell out every game despite decades of playoff disappointment. How?

**Manufactured scarcity:**
- Long season ticket waiting list (creates urgency)
- Limited single-game inventory (forces early buying)
- Premium pricing (signals exclusivity)
- Secondary market reinforcement (tickets resell at 1.5-2x face value, validating pricing)

This only works if you have authentic demand. But if you do—lean into it.

**[PAUSE]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
Now let's address the biggest threat to ticketing revenue: **the home viewing experience.**

4K TVs, replays, multiple camera angles, no lines for bathrooms, cheaper beer. Why go to the game?

Teams that thrive are those that make the **in-person experience irreplaceable**:
- Atmosphere (crowd energy, chants, rituals)
- Social experience (friends, family, community)
- Unique access (player warm-ups, behind-the-scenes tours)
- Sensory experiences (can't replicate the sound of a slapshot in person)

The teams that just offer "watch the game on a worse screen for 10x the cost"? They struggle.

**[TRANSITION]**

Let's move to our fourth stream: merchandising...

### Section 4 (65:00-80:00) - Revenue Sharing Models & Emerging Streams

**[ON-SCREEN: Section Title - "Revenue Sharing & Emerging Streams"]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
Now let's talk about something that makes sports truly unique: **revenue sharing.**

Most businesses want to crush their competitors. Sports leagues need their competitors to thrive. Why? Because competitive balance creates better product, which increases total revenue for everyone.

**[ON-SCREEN GRAPHIC: Revenue Sharing Models - NFL, NBA, NHL, EPL]**

**Model #1: NFL - Maximum Socialism**

The NFL shares nearly **60% of all revenue** equally among teams:
- National media rights → 100% shared
- Merchandise & licensing → 100% shared
- NFL+ streaming revenue → 100% shared
- Gate receipts → 60% shared (40% to home team)

What's NOT shared:
- Local sponsorships
- Stadium revenue (suites, naming rights, local concessions)

**Result:** The worst team and best team in the NFL receive similar revenue. Small-market Green Bay Packers can compete financially with big-market New York Giants.

**Philosophy:** "We're all in this together. A strong league benefits everyone."

**Model #2: NHL - Moderate Sharing**

The NHL shares about **50% of centralized revenue**:
- National media & licensing → 50% shared
- Local revenue → kept by teams (media, tickets, sponsorships)

Additionally, there's a **revenue sharing pool** funded by high-revenue teams that redistributes to low-revenue teams. This is the model you'll analyze in the Vancouver Canucks case.

**Challenge:** Canadian teams face currency exchange headwinds (revenues in CAD, many expenses in USD). Revenue sharing doesn't fully offset this.

**Model #3: English Premier League - Tiered Distribution**

EPL shares broadcast revenue, but not equally:
- 50% shared equally among all 20 teams
- 25% based on finishing position (winner gets more)
- 25% based on number of TV appearances

**Philosophy:** "Reward success, but maintain baseline competitiveness."

**Result:** Top teams (Manchester City, Liverpool) generate 3-4x more revenue than bottom teams. Wealth disparity, but not as extreme as unregulated leagues.

**[ON-SCREEN: Why Revenue Sharing Matters]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
Why should you care about revenue sharing as marketers or strategists?

**1. It affects your strategic options.**
If you're a team executive in the NFL, you can't just "out-revenue" competitors. You have to out-execute operationally (scouting, coaching, player development).

**2. It creates market positioning trade-offs.**
High-revenue teams in the NFL effectively subsidize small-market teams. That's a political tension. Should the Dallas Cowboys' branding success fund the Jacksonville Jaguars?

**3. It impacts valuations.**
When private equity or ownership groups buy teams, they model revenue potential. Leagues with strong revenue sharing offer more predictable, stable returns. Leagues without it are higher risk/reward.

**[TRANSITION TO EMERGING STREAMS]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
Now let's talk about the future: **emerging revenue streams.**

**[ON-SCREEN: Emerging Revenue Streams - Betting, Streaming, NFTs, Esports, International]**

**Stream #1: Sports Betting & Gaming**

This is the fastest-growing stream. Since U.S. legalization began in 2018 (Canada in 2021), sports leagues have generated billions through:

- **Betting partnerships:** FanDuel, DraftKings, BetMGM pay leagues for "official partner" status
- **Data licensing:** Leagues sell real-time game data to betting companies for in-game odds
- **Media integrations:** Betting odds displayed in broadcasts, driving engagement
- **Affiliate revenue:** Leagues promote betting apps, earn commission on sign-ups

**Current scale:** 2-8% of total revenue, but growing 30-40% year-over-year.

**Next week's focus:** You'll dive deep into this with the FanDuel case and betting integration strategies.

**Stream #2: Direct-to-Consumer Streaming**

Leagues are asking: "Why give all media rights to broadcasters? Why not go direct?"

Examples:
- **NBA League Pass:** Out-of-market games, $99/season
- **NHL.TV (now ESPN+):** Streaming-only package
- **DAZN:** Third-party aggregator, but league-licensed

**Opportunity:** Capture more margin (no broadcaster middleman), own customer relationship, flexible pricing.

**Challenge:** Customer acquisition costs, technology infrastructure, content volume (need 24/7 programming, not just games).

Most leagues are taking a hybrid approach: Partner with a broadcaster for most games, retain some streaming rights for direct offerings.

**Stream #3: International Expansion**

**NFL in London/Germany:** Growing European fan base, hosting international games, building merchandise market.

**NBA in China:** Massive basketball fandom, jersey sales, streaming deals. (Note: Political tensions have complicated this.)

**EPL global rights:** Premier League generates more revenue from international media rights than domestic UK rights.

**Why it matters:** Mature North American markets are tapped. Growth is global.

**Stream #4: NFTs, Crypto, Metaverse (Speculative)**

Some leagues experimented with:
- NFT collectibles (NBA Top Shot)
- Cryptocurrency sponsorships (FTX disaster)
- Metaverse experiences (virtual courtside seats)

**Status:** Mostly hype, limited lasting value so far. Worth monitoring, but not material revenue yet.

**[PAUSE]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
The key takeaway: **The sports revenue model is evolving.**

20 years ago, it was simple: tickets + local broadcast + some sponsorships.

Today, it's a complex ecosystem with 8-10 meaningful revenue streams, and the mix is different for every league, team, and market.

As marketers and strategists, your job is to:
1. Understand the full ecosystem
2. Identify growth opportunities
3. Balance short-term revenue with long-term brand health
4. Navigate the trade-offs (e.g., betting revenue vs. integrity concerns)

**[TRANSITION]**

Let's move to our final section: Q&A and future trends...

---

### Section 5 (80:00-90:00) - Q&A & Future Trends

**[ON-SCREEN: Section Title - "Q&A & Looking Ahead"]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
We've covered a lot—let's address some questions I often hear from MBA students and executives:

**Q1: "Is sports media in a bubble? Are rights deals overvalued?"**

**EXECUTIVE:**
Yes and no. On a pure advertising ROI basis, many deals don't pencil. But you have to look at the strategic value:

- **For traditional broadcasters:** Sports are the last content keeping people subscribed to cable. That defensive value is worth billions.
- **For streamers:** Sports drive app downloads and daily engagement. Amazon didn't buy NFL Thursday Night Football to make money directly—they bought it to increase Prime membership loyalty.

The question isn't "Is this profitable?" It's "What's the opportunity cost of NOT having sports?"

That said—I do think the market will correct. We've seen Netflix and other streamers pull back from expensive sports bids. There's a limit to how much anyone can pay.

**Q2: "How does NIL (Name, Image, Likeness) in college sports change the landscape?"**

**EXECUTIVE:**
Huge question. NIL allows college athletes to profit from their personal brands—endorsements, autograph signings, social media sponsorships.

For leagues and teams, this creates:
- **Talent development:** Athletes arrive in pro leagues with established personal brands and business savvy
- **Sponsor competition:** College athletes now compete for local sponsorship dollars that might have gone to pro teams
- **Fan engagement:** Fans can follow athletes from college through pro careers

It's early days, but this will reshape how athletes think about brand building and monetization.

**Q3: "What's the biggest revenue opportunity teams are missing?"**

**EXECUTIVE:**
**Data monetization.**

Teams and leagues have INCREDIBLE data:
- Who's buying tickets, when, and for which games
- In-venue behavior (concessions, movement patterns, dwell time)
- Streaming/app usage (what content fans consume, when they tune out)
- Social media engagement (sentiment, topic trends, influencer overlap)

Most teams barely use this data beyond basic CRM. Smart teams are:
- Selling anonymized insights to sponsors
- Using predictive analytics for pricing optimization
- Personalizing marketing (targeted offers based on fan behavior)
- Building partnerships with data companies (e.g., sports betting platforms want this data)

The teams that treat data as a strategic asset—not just an operational byproduct—will unlock massive value.

**[ON-SCREEN: Future Trends - Next 5-10 Years]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
Let me close with three predictions for where sports revenue is headed:

**Prediction #1: Betting Integration Becomes Ubiquitous**

Within 5 years, every broadcast will have integrated odds, prop bet options, and direct links to betting apps. This will:
- Increase fan engagement (more reasons to watch full games)
- Create new sponsorship inventory (sponsored odds displays, betting segments)
- Generate data licensing revenue (leagues selling real-time data feeds)

But—leagues will have to navigate integrity concerns. If fans believe outcomes are influenced by betting interests, trust collapses. This is a delicate balance.

**Prediction #2: Streaming Fragments the Market**

The "one broadcaster" model is dying. Expect:
- Games split across multiple platforms (ESPN+, Amazon, Apple TV+, YouTube)
- Fans needing 3-4 subscriptions to watch their team
- Frustration leading to piracy or cord-cutting

The challenge: How do leagues maximize revenue without alienating fans?

My bet: We'll see "league-branded aggregators"—imagine "NHL Pass" that bundles all games across platforms for one price. Leagues will recapture the customer relationship.

**Prediction #3: Globalization Accelerates**

The next billion fans aren't in North America. They're in:
- India (cricket dominates, but basketball and soccer growing)
- Africa (soccer, basketball, running)
- Southeast Asia (soccer, esports, basketball)

Leagues that crack international markets—through smart media partnerships, international games, localized content, and culturally relevant marketing—will unlock 2-3x revenue growth.

**[CAMERA: Close-up of executive]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
Here's my final thought: **Sports are one of the last monoculture experiences in a fragmented world.**

Millions of people watch the same event, at the same time, and talk about it together. That's incredibly rare in 2024. And it's incredibly valuable.

As marketers, strategists, and business leaders, your job is to protect that cultural relevance while monetizing it sustainably.

Don't kill the golden goose by over-commercializing. But don't leave money on the table either.

It's a balance. And the teams, leagues, and media companies that get it right will thrive for decades.

**[PAUSE]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
Thanks for your time. I'm excited to see how you apply these concepts in your case analysis and group projects. Good luck, and feel free to reach out if you have questions.

## Post-Recording: Student Discussion Prompts

After students watch this video, they should engage with these reflection questions in the discussion forum:

### Discussion Prompt #1: Revenue Interdependence
The executive emphasized that revenue streams are "interdependent, not independent." Identify one example from your own sports fandom where you've seen this interdependence in action. How did investment in one revenue stream impact others?

### Discussion Prompt #2: Strategic vs. Financial Value
The executive argued that many sports rights deals lose money on a P&L basis but create strategic value. Do you agree with this logic? At what point does "strategic value" become an excuse for bad business decisions?

### Discussion Prompt #3: Future Revenue Streams
Which of the "emerging revenue streams" (betting, streaming DTC, international expansion, NFTs/metaverse) do you think has the most potential? Which is most overhyped? Defend your position with evidence.
