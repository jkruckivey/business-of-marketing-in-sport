### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]**

**[ON-SCREEN: Five revenue stream icons appearing]**

**NARRATOR:**
Professional sports generates revenue from five major sources. Understanding these streams is essential for analyzing sports business strategy.

Let's break them down quickly.

---

**[SECTION: THE FIVE STREAMS - 0:15-1:45]**

**[ANIMATION: Each stream appears with percentage]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Stream #1: Media Rights (40-60% of revenue)**
Broadcasting and streaming deals. The NFL's current media rights total $110 billion over 11 years. This is the foundation of modern sports economics.

**Stream #2: Ticketing & Live Events (20-30%)**
Not just ticket sales—luxury suites, dynamic pricing, concessions, parking. Teams generate $40-50 per attendee beyond the ticket price.

**Stream #3: Sponsorship & Partnerships (15-25%)**
Corporate deals like naming rights, jersey sponsors, and category partnerships. Scotiabank Arena pays $30-50 million per year for naming rights.

**Stream #4: Merchandising & Licensing (5-10%)**
Jerseys, hats, video games. Often pooled and shared equally across teams to maintain competitive balance.

**Stream #5: Betting & Gaming (2-8%, growing fast)**
The newest frontier. Leagues earn billions through betting partnerships, data licensing, and media integration. Growing 30-40% year-over-year.

---

**[CONCLUSION - 1:45-2:00]**

**[ANIMATION: Five streams connecting as ecosystem]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Key insight:** These streams don't exist in isolation. They're interconnected. Investment in one stream amplifies others.

Successful organizations build revenue **ecosystems**, not portfolios.

## Video 2: Sponsorship & Merchandising Overview (2 minutes) ⭐ **NEW FOR MODULE 3**

**Purpose:** Visual break at midpoint of Module 3; covers brand-driven revenue streams
**Placement:** Module 3, Element 12 (after ticketing, before detailed sponsorship text)
**Visual Style:** Clean animated graphics with brand logos and examples

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]**

**[ON-SCREEN: Brand logos (Scotiabank, Nike, FanDuel) surrounding sports team logos]**

**NARRATOR:**
While media rights and ticketing depend on the game itself, two revenue streams are driven by **brand value**: sponsorship and merchandising.

Let's see how teams monetize their brands through corporate partnerships and consumer products.

---

**[SECTION: SPONSORSHIP - 0:15-1:00]**

**[ANIMATION: Stadium with naming rights, jersey patches, in-venue signage]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Sponsorship: 15-25% of Revenue**

The most visible sponsorship deals are **naming rights**: Scotiabank Arena in Toronto—$800 million over 20 years. That's $40 million per year just for the name.

**[ON-SCREEN: Jersey patch examples from NBA]**

**Jersey sponsorship** arrived in North America in 2017. The NBA allows a 2.5-inch patch on uniforms. Top deals reach $20-30 million per year—Golden State Warriors and Rakuten, $20 million annually.

**[ANIMATION: Sponsor activation examples]**

But the best sponsors don't just buy logos—they create **experiences**. Scotiabank's "Scene+ Night" at Leafs games integrates their loyalty program with ticket offers and in-arena experiences. Fans remember positive moments, not just a logo.

**Key sponsorship categories:**
- Naming rights ($15-50M/year)
- Jersey/uniform patches ($5-30M/year)
- Category partnerships—official bank, beer, airline ($500K-10M/year)

---

**[SECTION: MERCHANDISING - 1:00-1:45]**

**[ANIMATION: Jerseys, hats, merchandise flooding screen]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Merchandising: 5-10% of Revenue**

Most major North American leagues—NFL, NHL, MLB—use a **centralized model**. The league manages all licensing, then splits revenue equally among teams.

Why? **Competitive balance.** This prevents the Yankees and Cowboys from dominating merchandise sales and creating massive revenue gaps.

**[ON-SCREEN: LeBron Lakers jersey, Championship gear, City Edition designs]**

**Revenue spikes during:**
- **Championship runs:** Sales increase 200-400% during playoffs
- **Star acquisitions:** LeBron's trade to the Lakers generated over $1 million in jersey sales within hours
- **New designs:** NBA "City Edition" jerseys generate over $100 million annually

**[ANIMATION: Digital commerce icons]**

Digital commerce transformed merchandising—teams now sell globally without retail partnerships. The Toronto Raptors ship merchandise to **85+ countries** through their online store.

---

**[CONCLUSION - 1:45-2:00]**

**[ON-SCREEN: Sponsorship + Merchandising = Brand-Driven Revenue]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Key insight:** These are **brand-driven revenue streams**. The stronger your brand, the more valuable your sponsorship inventory and the more merchandise you sell.

Next up: **Betting**—the newest and fastest-growing revenue frontier.

## Video 3 (Original): Revenue Sharing Models (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Explain why and how leagues share revenue
**Placement:** Module 5 (Before Case Study)
**Visual Style:** Animated comparisons with simple financial graphics

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]**

**[ANIMATION: Team logos circling around league shield]**

**NARRATOR:**
Unlike most industries, professional sports leagues NEED their competitors to thrive. Why?

Because competitive balance creates a better product—and makes everyone more money.

This is the logic behind **revenue sharing**.

---

**[SECTION: THREE MODELS - 0:15-1:45]**

**[ANIMATION: Three league models side-by-side]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Model #1: NFL—Maximum Socialism (60% shared)**
Nearly all revenue is shared equally. Result? The Green Bay Packers—population 105,000—generate similar revenue to the New York Giants. Highest competitive parity in sports.

**Model #2: NHL—Moderate Sharing (50% shared)**
National media rights, streaming, and merchandise are shared. Local media rights and ticket sales stay with teams. Plus a revenue sharing pool for struggling teams.

The complication? Canadian teams earn in Canadian dollars but pay players in U.S. dollars. Currency fluctuations create major challenges.

**Model #3: Premier League—Tiered Distribution**
TV revenue split three ways: 50% equal, 25% based on finishing position, 25% based on TV appearances. Rewards success while maintaining baseline competitiveness.

---

**[CONCLUSION - 1:45-2:00]**

**[ON-SCREEN: Key principle]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Why this matters:** Revenue sharing limits strategic options, creates governance tensions, and affects team valuations.

In the Vancouver Canucks case, you'll see how revenue sharing—and currency headwinds—affect strategic decisions.

**[END SCREEN]**

## Video 3: The Rogers NHL Deal Overview (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Quick context for Week 2 Rogers case study
**Placement:** Module 7 (Week 2 preview) OR Week 2 Module 1 (case intro)
**Visual Style:** Mix of graphics and key data points

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]**

**[ON-SCREEN: $5.2 BILLION - 12 YEARS]**

**NARRATOR:**
November 2013: Rogers Communications paid $5.2 billion for exclusive Canadian NHL rights—12 years, all platforms, all games.

The largest sports media deal in Canadian history.

Ten years later? They lost an estimated $1-1.5 billion.

What happened?

---

**[SECTION: THE BET & THE FAILURE - 0:15-1:45]**

**[ANIMATION: Three strategic goals vs. three fatal flaws]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Rogers' Three Strategic Goals:**

**1. Defend cable subscribers.** They believed NHL rights would prevent cord-cutting.
**Reality:** Canadian cable subscribers dropped 28% (2014-2024). Hockey didn't stop the decline.

**2. Build streaming dominance.** They projected 1+ million Sportsnet NOW subscribers.
**Reality:** They reached only 450,000 by 2024—missing targets by 50-70% every year.

**3. Brand positioning.** Become Canada's #1 sports network.
**Partial success:** Sportsnet built brand equity, but at massive financial cost.

**[DATA VISUALIZATION: Revenue vs. Cost gap]**

**The Fatal Flaw:** Rogers paid $433 million per year but generated only $200-380 million. They never achieved profitability.

**COVID Impact:** 2020-21 season collapse. Rogers still paid full rights fees with no flexibility clause. Lost $233 million in one year alone.

---

**[CONCLUSION - 1:45-2:00]**

**[ON-SCREEN: Key lessons]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Lessons learned:**
- Content alone isn't enough—streaming experience matters
- Flexibility clauses are worth the cost
- 12-year deals are dangerous in a disrupted media landscape

In Week 2, you'll analyze this deal in depth and recommend what Rogers should do when the contract expires in 2026.
