## Video 1: How to Value Sports Media Rights (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Introduce the 5-factor valuation framework before Streaming Wars simulation
**Placement:** Module 3 (Media Rights Framework) - Before simulation activity
**Visual Style:** Animated framework with quick data examples

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]**

**[ANIMATION: Billion-dollar figures materializing]**

**NARRATOR:**
Amazon paid $1 billion per year for NFL Thursday Night Football. Rogers paid $5.2 billion over 12 years for NHL Canadian rights.

How do media companies decide what sports content is worth?

**The Five-Factor Valuation Framework.**

---

**[SECTION: THE FIVE FACTORS - 0:15-1:45]**

**[ANIMATION: Five factors appearing with icons]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Factor #1: Audience Size & Demographics**
Larger, more valuable audiences command higher prices. NFL delivers 20 million viewers with premium demographics (males 18-49, high income). Advertisers pay $50-70 per thousand viewers—double non-sports rates.

**Critical:** Model viewership trends, not just current numbers. Rogers assumed stable NHL ratings. They declined 15-20%. That's hundreds of millions in lost revenue.

**Factor #2: Exclusivity & Competition**
More bidders = higher prices. Exclusive rights cost 2-3× more than non-exclusive. When Amazon, Apple, and traditional networks compete for NFL rights, prices skyrocket. NFL deal increased 4× from 2011 to 2022.

**Factor #3: Content Volume & Scheduling**
Quality matters more than quantity. One NFL primetime game is worth 10-15 mid-week NHL games. Concentrated scheduling windows (NFL Sundays) create predictable audience habits and higher per-game value.

**Factor #4: Brand Alignment & Sponsorship**
Sponsorship revenue can subsidize 20-35% of rights costs. TSN's Formula 1 package: $15M ad revenue + $20M sponsorship = profitable. Without sponsorship, it loses money.

**Factor #5: Platform Strategy Fit**
Sometimes you pay more than a property is "worth" because it serves strategic goals. Amazon's $1B/year for NFL drives 3-5M new Prime memberships + retail halo effect. Total strategic value: ~$900M/year.

**Warning:** Strategic value must be measurable. Rogers justified overpaying with "subscriber defense" logic—but couldn't prove it. When subscribers left anyway, the case collapsed.

**[CONCLUSION - 1:45-2:00]**

**[ON-SCREEN: Five factors framework]**

**NARRATOR:**
**The Five Factors:**
1. Audience Size & Demographics
2. Exclusivity & Competition
3. Content Volume & Scheduling
4. Brand Alignment & Sponsorship
5. Platform Strategy Fit

In the Streaming Wars simulation, you'll apply this framework to make your own billion-dollar decisions.

## Video 2: Linear TV vs. Streaming Economics (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Compare traditional broadcasting to streaming business models
**Placement:** Module 3 (After valuation framework, before simulation)
**Visual Style:** Split-screen comparison with financial models

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]**

**[ANIMATION: Old TV morphing into streaming app]**

**NARRATOR:**
For 50 years, sports media economics were simple: Broadcast games on TV, sell ads, make money.

Then streaming arrived.

**Linear TV vs. Streaming:** Fundamentally different economics. Let's compare them side-by-side.

---

**[SECTION: SIDE-BY-SIDE COMPARISON - 0:15-1:45]**

**[SPLIT SCREEN THROUGHOUT: Linear TV left, Streaming right]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Revenue Models:**

**Linear TV:** Advertising (70-80%) + Carriage fees (20-30%)
- TSN charges cable providers $1-3 per subscriber/month
- Ad rates: $40-70 per thousand viewers for premium sports

**Streaming:** Subscriptions (80-95%) + Optional ads (5-20%)
- Fans pay $10-30/month directly
- More predictable revenue (subscribers pay monthly regardless of viewership)

**Key difference:** Linear monetizes AUDIENCE. Streaming monetizes SUBSCRIBERS.

---

**Cost Structures:**

**Linear TV:** Rights fees (60-70%) + Production (20-30%) + Low distribution costs
- Infrastructure already exists (cable networks)

**Streaming:** Rights fees (40-50%) + Technology (25-35%) + Customer Acquisition (20-30%)
- Must build platform ($50-100M initial investment)
- Customer acquisition cost: $50-200 per subscriber
- Front-loaded costs—heavy Year 1-3 investment

---

**Profitability Timelines:**

**Linear TV:** Immediate (if priced right)
- If ad revenue + carriage fees > rights + production, you're profitable Day 1
- **BUT:** Assumes stable viewership (cord-cutting risk)

**Streaming:** 3-5 years (customer lifetime value model)
- Year 1-2: Heavy losses (building platform, acquiring customers)
- Year 3-4: Approaching break-even
- Year 5+: Profitability
- **Requires:** Customer LTV > Customer acquisition cost

---

**Key Risks:**

**Linear TV:** Cord-cutting, audience fragmentation, generational shift
- Canadian market: 11.2M subscribers (2014) → 8.1M (2024), -28% decline

**Streaming:** High churn, price sensitivity, competition from tech giants, technology costs
- Sports-only services: 25-40% annual churn (highly seasonal)
- Binary outcome: Win big or fail

---

**[CONCLUSION - 1:45-2:00]**

**[ANIMATION: Hybrid model illustrated]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Most successful strategy? Hybrid.**

Maintain linear TV cash flow while building streaming for the future.

The risk? Cord-cutting cannibalizes faster than streaming grows. This is what happened to Rogers—lost cable subscribers before gaining enough streaming subscribers.

In your simulation, you'll choose: Linear, streaming, or hybrid?
