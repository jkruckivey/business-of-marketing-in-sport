### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:45]**

**[ANIMATION: Billion-dollar figures floating across screen, then materializing as contract documents]**

**NARRATOR:**
Sports media rights deals are measured in billions:
- Amazon paid **$1 billion per year** for NFL Thursday Night Football
- Apple paid **$2.5 billion over 10 years** for MLS
- Rogers paid **$5.2 billion over 12 years** for NHL Canadian rights

**[ON-SCREEN: Question appearing]**

**How do media companies decide what sports content is worth?**

The answer: A systematic valuation framework.

In this video, you'll learn the **five factors** that drive media rights valuations—the same framework used by executives at ESPN, TSN, DAZN, Amazon, and Apple when bidding on sports properties.

By the end, you'll understand how to evaluate billion-dollar deals yourself.

Let's dive in.

**[SECTION 1: FACTOR #1 - AUDIENCE SIZE & DEMOGRAPHICS - 1:00-3:00]**

**[ANIMATION: Stadium filling with diverse fans, then zooming out to show millions watching on screens]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Factor #1: Audience Size & Demographics**

Media companies buy sports rights to reach audiences. The larger and more valuable the audience, the higher the price.

**[ON-SCREEN: Valuation equation]**

**Valuation Formula (Simplified):**
Rights Value = Audience Size × Demographic Value × Games Per Year

**[DATA VISUALIZATION: Three metrics appearing]**

**Metric 1: Total Viewership**

How many people watch? Measured by average viewers per game or event.

**[EXAMPLES ON-SCREEN]**

- NFL Sunday Night Football: 20 million viewers (U.S.)
- NBA Finals: 12 million viewers (U.S.)
- NHL Hockey Night in Canada: 1.5 million viewers (Canada)

Bigger audience = more advertising inventory = higher value.

**[ANIMATION: Demographic breakdown appearing]**

**Metric 2: Demographic Composition**

Not all viewers are equally valuable. Advertisers pay premium rates for:
- **Males 18-49** (hardest demographic to reach)
- **High-income households** ($100K+ annual income)
- **Engaged viewers** (watching live, not second-screening)

**[COMPARISON CHART: CPM rates]**

**Cost Per Thousand Viewers (CPM):**
- NFL primetime: $50-70 CPM
- NBA playoffs: $40-60 CPM
- MLB regular season: $15-25 CPM
- Primetime drama (non-sports): $15-25 CPM

**Why the premium?** Sports deliver live, engaged, affluent audiences that advertisers can't reach elsewhere.

**[ANIMATION: Trend line showing viewership trajectory]**

**Metric 3: Viewership Trends**

Is the audience growing, stable, or declining?

**[CASE EXAMPLES]**

- **Growing:** MLS viewership +15% year-over-year → Higher valuations
- **Stable:** NFL viewership flat/growing slightly → Maintains high value
- **Declining:** Linear TV NHL viewership -15-20% over decade → Lower valuations

**[WARNING GRAPHIC]**

**Critical mistake:** Assuming current viewership will continue. Rogers assumed NHL ratings would stay stable. They declined 15-20%. That's **hundreds of millions** in lost revenue.

**[KEY TAKEAWAY BOX]**

**Factor #1 Key Takeaway:**
Bigger, more valuable audiences command higher rights fees. But model conservatively—viewership trends matter as much as current numbers.

---

**[SECTION 2: FACTOR #2 - EXCLUSIVITY & COMPETITION - 3:00-4:45]**

**[ANIMATION: Multiple bidders competing, driving price up]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Factor #2: Exclusivity & Competition**

The more bidders competing for rights, the higher the price. And exclusive rights cost **2-3× more** than non-exclusive.

**[SCENARIO COMPARISON]**

**Scenario A: Multiple Bidders + Exclusivity**

In 2013, Rogers, TSN, CBC, and U.S. networks all wanted NHL rights. Rogers bid **$5.2 billion** for Canadian exclusivity—blowing away competitors.

Result: **Massive overpay**. Without competition, rights might have cost $3-4 billion.

**[ANIMATION: Bidding war escalation]**

**Scenario B: Tech Giants Enter Sports**

When Amazon, Apple, YouTube, and traditional networks compete for NFL rights, prices skyrocket.

- 2011 deal: $27 billion over 9 years
- 2022 deal: **$110 billion over 11 years** (4× increase)

**Why?** More bidders = more competition = higher price.

**[ON-SCREEN: Exclusivity premium calculation]**

**The Exclusivity Premium**

**Non-exclusive rights:** League sells to multiple broadcasters
- Lower cost per broadcaster ($100-200M/year)
- Shared audience (games on multiple networks)

**Exclusive rights:** One broadcaster gets ALL games
- Higher cost (2-3× premium) ($300-600M/year)
- Total control of distribution
- Prevents competitors from accessing content

**[STRATEGIC QUESTION ON-SCREEN]**

**When is exclusivity worth it?**

**Worth it when:**
- You're defending cable subscribers (need content competitors can't offer)
- You're building a brand identity ("Home of NHL Hockey")
- Market share gains offset premium cost

**NOT worth it when:**
- You're a streaming challenger (can't afford to overpay)
- Exclusive premium exceeds profit margin
- Audience is fragmented (won't switch platforms for one property)

**[CASE EXAMPLE: DAZN's non-exclusive strategy]**

DAZN Canada chose **non-exclusive rights** to soccer, combat sports, and NFL. Lower costs, diversified portfolio, less risk.

Result: Survived where pure-play exclusive streamers failed.

**[KEY TAKEAWAY BOX]**

**Factor #2 Key Takeaway:**
Competition drives prices up. Exclusivity costs 2-3× more. Pay the premium only if strategic value justifies it.

---

**[SECTION 3: FACTOR #3 - CONTENT VOLUME & SCHEDULING - 4:45-6:15]**

**[ANIMATION: Calendar filling with games, some highlighted, others dimmed]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Factor #3: Content Volume & Scheduling Flexibility**

More games = more advertising inventory = more revenue. But not all games are equal.

**[COMPARISON: NHL vs. NFL]**

**NHL:**
- 82 games per team
- 1,312 total games per season
- Many games overlap (simultaneous start times)
- **Result:** Only 20-30% of games have national TV value

**NFL:**
- 17 games per team
- 272 total games per season
- Concentrated windows (Sunday 1pm, 4pm, 8pm; Monday, Thursday)
- **Result:** Nearly 100% of games have national TV value

**[DATA VISUALIZATION: Value per game]**

**Value Per Game:**
- NFL Sunday Night Football: $50-70 million per game
- NBA Finals Game 7: $30-40 million per game
- NHL Saturday night: $3-5 million per game

**[PRINCIPLE ON-SCREEN]**

**"Quality of inventory matters more than quantity."**

One NFL primetime game is worth 10-15 mid-week NHL games.

**[ANIMATION: Scheduling windows illustrated]**

**Scheduling Flexibility Creates Value:**

**High flexibility (NFL):**
- Thursday night, Sunday 1pm, Sunday 4pm, Sunday 8pm, Monday night
- Media companies can build programming around games
- Audiences know when to tune in ("Sunday is football day")

**Low flexibility (Most leagues):**
- Games scattered throughout week
- Competing with other content
- Harder to build audience habits

**[CASE EXAMPLE: English Premier League]**

Premier League games air Saturday-Sunday in concentrated windows. This creates:
- Predictable audience habits
- High per-game value
- Global broadcast-friendly timing

**[KEY TAKEAWAY BOX]**

**Factor #3 Key Takeaway:**
Content volume matters, but quality and scheduling matter more. Concentrated, high-value inventory commands premium pricing.

---

**[SECTION 4: FACTOR #4 - BRAND ALIGNMENT & SPONSORSHIP - 6:15-7:45]**

**[ANIMATION: Sports property connecting with sponsor logos, generating revenue stream]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Factor #4: Brand Alignment & Sponsorship Activation**

Media rights aren't just about ad revenue. They unlock **sponsorship revenue**—which can subsidize 20-35% of rights costs.

**[EQUATION ON-SCREEN]**

**Total Media Value = Ad Revenue + Sponsorship Revenue**

**[EXAMPLE: TSN's F1 package]**

TSN pays ~$30 million per year for Formula 1 Canadian rights.

**Ad Revenue:** $15 million
**Sponsorship Revenue:** $20 million (luxury brands, auto manufacturers)
**Total:** $35 million

**Profit:** $5 million

Without sponsorship, the deal loses money. With sponsorship, it's profitable.

**[ANIMATION: Sponsorship categories illustrated]**

**Types of Sponsorship Inventory:**

**1. Broadcast Integrations**
"This power play brought to you by Scotiabank"
"Budweiser Player of the Game"

**2. Studio Show Sponsorships**
"Sportsnet Central, presented by Canadian Tire"

**3. Digital Extensions**
Sponsored content, social media campaigns, app features

**4. B2B Hospitality**
Suite access, event tickets for VIP clients

**[DATA POINT]**

For a major property like NHL hockey, broadcasters can generate **$100-150 million per year** in incremental sponsorship revenue tied directly to holding rights.

**[STRATEGIC INSIGHT ON-SCREEN]**

**"If you can't build a sponsorship ecosystem around a property, reconsider the acquisition."**

**[CASE COMPARISON]**

**High Sponsorship Value:**
- Olympics (luxury brands, global corporations)
- F1 (automotive, watches, financial services)
- Golf (affluent audience, premium sponsors)

**Low Sponsorship Value:**
- Niche sports (small, scattered audience)
- Properties with limited brand alignment
- Over-saturated categories (too many sponsors, low impact)

**[KEY TAKEAWAY BOX]**

**Factor #4 Key Takeaway:**
Sponsorship revenue can subsidize 20-35% of rights costs. Evaluate sponsorship potential alongside ad revenue.

**[SECTION 5: FACTOR #5 - PLATFORM STRATEGY FIT - 7:45-9:30]**

**[ANIMATION: Two different platform types with different goals]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Factor #5: Platform Strategy Fit**

This is where financial analysis meets strategic vision. Sometimes you pay more than a property is "worth" because it serves a bigger objective.

**[SPLIT SCREEN: Traditional Broadcaster vs. Streaming Platform]**

**Traditional Broadcasters (TSN, Sportsnet, ESPN):**

**Goal:** Defend cable subscribers from cord-cutting

**Sports Role:** Retention tool (sports fans 40% less likely to cancel cable)

**Valuation Logic:**
"This deal loses $50M/year on ad revenue alone, but it prevents $500M in subscriber churn losses. **Net benefit: $450M.**"

**[ANIMATION: Subscriber churn prevented]**

Example: Bell Media keeps TSN strong to retain Bell cable/satellite customers. Sports rights are defensive plays.

---

**Streaming Platforms (DAZN, Amazon, Apple):**

**Goal:** Acquire new subscribers and build daily engagement

**Sports Role:** Subscriber acquisition tool

**Valuation Logic:**
"This deal costs $200M/year, but it brings 2M new subscribers at $100 lifetime value each. **Net benefit: +$200M.**"

**[ANIMATION: Amazon Prime flywheel]**

**Case Example: Amazon NFL Thursday Night Football**

Amazon pays **$1 billion per year** for exclusive streaming rights.

Did they do it for ad revenue? No.

They did it because:
- **Prime membership sign-ups:** Estimated 3-5M new members
- **Retail halo effect:** Prime members spend 2-3× more on Amazon retail
- **Platform stickiness:** Sports viewers use Prime Video more frequently

**[CALCULATION ON-SCREEN]**

3 million new Prime members × $139/year = $417M/year in membership revenue
PLUS retail halo effect (estimated +$500M/year)
**Total strategic value: ~$900M/year**

Against $1B cost? Close to break-even, with long-term upside.

**[WARNING GRAPHIC]**

**But beware: "Strategic value" can become an excuse for bad deals.**

**[CASE EXAMPLE: Rogers NHL]**

Rogers justified $433M/year using "strategic value" logic: "We're buying subscriber defense, not just ad revenue."

Problem: They couldn't prove the causal link. When subscribers left anyway, the strategic case collapsed.

**[RULE ON-SCREEN]**

**Rule: Strategic value is real—BUT it must be measurable and testable.**

If you can't prove sports actually prevent churn or drive sign-ups, you're speculating.

**[KEY TAKEAWAY BOX]**

**Factor #5 Key Takeaway:**
Platform strategy matters as much as financial ROI. But strategic value must be measurable—not a post-hoc rationalization.

---

**[CONCLUSION: PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER - 9:30-11:00]**

**[ANIMATION: Five factors appearing as interconnected framework]**

**NARRATOR:**
**The Five-Factor Valuation Framework:**

1. **Audience Size & Demographics** – Bigger, more valuable audiences command higher prices
2. **Exclusivity & Competition** – More bidders = higher prices; exclusivity costs 2-3× more
3. **Content Volume & Scheduling** – Quality of inventory > quantity
4. **Brand Alignment & Sponsorship** – Sponsorship can subsidize 20-35% of costs
5. **Platform Strategy Fit** – Strategic value justifies financial losses (if measurable)

**[ON-SCREEN: Valuation process flowchart]**

**How to Apply This Framework:**

**Step 1:** Model audience size, demographics, trends (Factor #1)

**Step 2:** Assess competitive landscape and exclusivity premium (Factor #2)

**Step 3:** Calculate content volume and inventory quality (Factor #3)

**Step 4:** Project sponsorship revenue tied to rights (Factor #4)

**Step 5:** Quantify strategic value (subscriber defense, acquisition, brand) (Factor #5)

**Step 6:** Sum total value vs. rights cost → Make bid/no-bid decision

**[CASE APPLICATION PREVIEW]**

In your Streaming Wars Strategy simulation, you'll apply this framework to make your own rights acquisition decisions:
- Which properties to bid on?
- How much to pay?
- Exclusive or non-exclusive?
- What subscription price can you charge?

There's no single "right" strategy—but there are defensible and indefensible decisions.

**[FINAL SCREEN: Five key principles]**

**Key Principles:**
1. Bigger, more valuable audiences = higher value
2. Competition and exclusivity drive prices up
3. Quality of inventory > quantity
4. Sponsorship subsidizes costs
5. Strategic value must be measurable

Now it's time to apply this framework. Good luck in the simulation!

## Video 2: Linear TV vs. Streaming - Two Business Models (8 minutes)

**Purpose:** Explain the economics of traditional broadcasting vs. direct-to-consumer streaming
**Placement:** Module 3 (After valuation framework, before simulation)
**Visual Style:** Split-screen comparisons with financial models

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:30]**

**[ANIMATION: Old TV set morphing into smartphone streaming app]**

**NARRATOR:**
For 50 years, sports media economics were simple: Broadcast games on TV, sell ads, make money.

Then streaming arrived.

**[SPLIT SCREEN: Linear TV vs. Streaming platform]**

Today, media companies face a choice: The traditional **linear TV model** or the disruptive **direct-to-consumer streaming model**.

They have fundamentally different economics—different revenue sources, cost structures, profitability timelines, and risks.

Understanding these differences is critical for evaluating media strategy decisions.

Let's compare them side by side.

---

**[SECTION 1: REVENUE MODELS - 0:30-2:30]**

**[SPLIT SCREEN THROUGHOUT: Linear TV on left, Streaming on right]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Revenue Model: How Do They Make Money?**

**[LEFT SIDE: Linear TV]**

**Linear TV Revenue:**

**1. Advertising (70-80% of revenue)**
- Sell 30-second commercial spots during games
- Charge based on CPM (cost per thousand viewers)
- Premium rates for live sports ($40-70 CPM)

**Example:** 2 million viewers × $50 CPM × 20 ad spots per game = $2 million per game

**2. Carriage Fees (20-30% of revenue)**
- Cable/satellite providers pay to carry the channel
- TSN charges ~$1-3 per subscriber per month
- 5 million subscribers × $2/month = $10 million/month

**[ON-SCREEN: Linear TV revenue equation]**

**Total Linear Revenue = Ad Sales + Carriage Fees**

**[RIGHT SIDE: Streaming/DTC]**

**Streaming/DTC Revenue:**

**1. Subscriptions (80-95% of revenue)**
- Fans pay monthly fee directly
- $10-30 per month per subscriber
- 500K subscribers × $25/month = $12.5 million/month

**2. Advertising (5-20% of revenue)**
- Ad-supported tiers (lower subscription price)
- Or hybrid model (ads + subscription)
- Typically lower CPM than linear ($20-40 vs. $50-70)

**[ON-SCREEN: Streaming revenue equation]**

**Total Streaming Revenue = Subscriptions + (Optional) Ads**

**[COMPARISON BOX]**

**Key Difference:**
- Linear TV: Monetize AUDIENCE (sell ads)
- Streaming: Monetize SUBSCRIBERS (sell access)

**[ANIMATION: Revenue stability comparison]**

**Revenue Predictability:**

- **Linear TV:** Highly variable (depends on viewership, which fluctuates)
- **Streaming:** More predictable (subscribers pay monthly regardless of viewership)

**[KEY TAKEAWAY]**

Linear TV is **audience-dependent**. Streaming is **subscriber-dependent**. This fundamentally changes business strategy.

---

**[SECTION 2: COST STRUCTURES - 2:30-4:00]**

**[SPLIT SCREEN CONTINUES]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Cost Structure: Where Does the Money Go?**

**[LEFT SIDE: Linear TV]**

**Linear TV Costs:**

**1. Rights Fees (60-70% of costs)**
- Payment to league/property for broadcast rights
- $200-500 million per year for major properties

**2. Production Costs (20-30% of costs)**
- Cameras, commentators, graphics, production crew
- $50K-200K per game

**3. Distribution Costs (Low)**
- Cable/satellite infrastructure already exists
- Minimal incremental cost

**[ON-SCREEN: Linear cost breakdown pie chart]**

**Total Linear Costs = Rights Fees + Production + (Minimal) Distribution**

**[RIGHT SIDE: Streaming/DTC]**

**Streaming/DTC Costs:**

**1. Rights Fees (40-50% of costs)**
- Same as linear, sometimes lower (non-exclusive rights)

**2. Technology Infrastructure (25-35% of costs)**
- Build streaming platform ($50-100 million initial investment)
- CDN (content delivery network) costs ($5-20 million/year)
- App development (iOS, Android, web, smart TVs)

**3. Customer Acquisition (20-30% of costs)**
- Digital advertising to drive sign-ups
- **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost): $50-200 per subscriber**
- 100K subscribers × $100 CAC = $10 million

**4. Production Costs (Similar to linear)**

**[ON-SCREEN: Streaming cost breakdown pie chart]**

**Total Streaming Costs = Rights + Technology + CAC + Production**

**[COMPARISON BOX]**

**Key Difference:**
- Linear TV: Low fixed costs (infrastructure exists)
- Streaming: High upfront costs (build platform + acquire customers)

**[ANIMATION: Cost curve over time]**

**Cost Behavior:**

- **Linear TV:** Costs relatively flat (pay rights fees, produce games)
- **Streaming:** Costs front-loaded (massive Year 1-3 investment, then stabilize)

**[WARNING GRAPHIC]**

Many streaming services underestimate CAC and technology costs. This is why most lose money for 3-5 years.

---

**[SECTION 3: PROFITABILITY TIMELINES - 4:00-5:30]**

**[SPLIT SCREEN WITH PROFITABILITY CURVES]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Profitability: How Long Until You Make Money?**

**[LEFT SIDE: Linear TV profitability curve]**

**Linear TV: Immediate (If Priced Right)**

If ad revenue + carriage fees > rights fees + production, you're profitable Day 1.

**Example:**
- Revenue: $300M/year (ads + carriage)
- Costs: $250M/year (rights + production)
- **Profit: $50M/year from Year 1**

**[ANIMATION: Profit appearing immediately]**

**BUT:** This assumes:
- Stable viewership (no cord-cutting)
- Stable ad rates (no decline)
- Stable carriage fees (no subscriber loss)

**Rogers NHL Example:**
They modeled immediate profitability. But cord-cutting reduced both ad revenue and carriage fees. **Never reached profitability.**

**[RIGHT SIDE: Streaming profitability curve]**

**Streaming: 3-5 Years (Customer LTV Model)**

Streaming requires playing the long game.

**[ANIMATION: J-curve profitability]**

**Year 1-2:** Heavy losses (building platform, acquiring customers)
- Year 1 loss: $100-200 million
- Year 2 loss: $50-100 million

**Year 3-4:** Approaching break-even (subscriber growth + reduced CAC)
- Year 3 loss: $20-50 million
- Year 4 break-even: $0

**Year 5+:** Profitability (subscription revenue > all costs + churn)
- Year 5 profit: $50-100 million
- Scales as subscriber base grows

**[ON-SCREEN: Customer LTV equation]**

**Streaming Profitability Math:**
**Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)** = Avg. monthly subscription × Avg. months subscribed

If LTV > CAC, you're building a profitable business (just slowly).

**[EXAMPLE CALCULATION]**

- Subscription: $25/month
- Avg. subscriber retention: 18 months
- **LTV: $450**
- CAC: $100
- **Net value per customer: $350**

Acquire 1 million subscribers = $350 million in long-term value (even though Year 1 shows losses).

**[COMPARISON BOX]**

**Key Difference:**
- Linear TV: Immediate profit (or loss)
- Streaming: Invest upfront for long-term profitability

---

**[SECTION 4: KEY RISKS - 5:30-7:00]**

**[SPLIT SCREEN: Risk factors highlighted]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Risks: What Can Go Wrong?**

**[LEFT SIDE: Linear TV risks]**

**Linear TV Risks:**

**1. Cord-Cutting**
- Subscribers canceling cable/satellite
- Canadian market: 11.2M (2014) → 8.1M (2024), -28%
- Directly reduces carriage fee revenue

**2. Audience Fragmentation**
- Viewers have more entertainment options
- Sports viewership declining in key demographics (18-34)
- Lower ratings = lower ad revenue

**3. Generational Shift**
- Younger viewers don't watch traditional TV
- Can't reverse this trend, only slow it

**[RISK ASSESSMENT: Medium-High]**

Linear TV is a **declining but still profitable** model. Works for 5-10 more years, but long-term outlook uncertain.

**[RIGHT SIDE: Streaming risks]**

**Streaming/DTC Risks:**

**1. High Churn**
- Sports-only services: 25-40% annual churn (highly seasonal)
- Subscribers cancel after playoffs, resubscribe next season
- Constantly need to acquire new subscribers

**2. Price Sensitivity**
- Consumers have "subscription fatigue" (paying for Netflix, Disney+, Spotify, etc.)
- Resistance to paying $25-30 for sports-only service
- Downward price pressure

**3. Competition**
- Competing with deep-pocketed tech giants (Amazon, Apple, Google)
- Can't outspend them on content or technology
- Market share battles drive up costs

**4. Technology Costs**
- Platform maintenance, upgrades, security
- CDN costs scale with usage
- Must continually invest to stay competitive

**[RISK ASSESSMENT: High]**

Streaming is **high-risk, high-reward**. Many services fail. Survivors can be highly profitable (see Netflix, Disney+).

**[COMPARISON BOX]**

**Risk Summary:**
- Linear TV: Medium-high risk (slow decline)
- Streaming: High risk (binary outcome: win big or fail)

---

**[CONCLUSION: HYBRID STRATEGY - 7:00-8:00]**

**[ANIMATION: Linear + Streaming merging]**

**NARRATOR:**
Given these trade-offs, what's the optimal strategy?

**[ON-SCREEN: Hybrid Model illustration]**

**The Hybrid Approach (What Most Do)**

Maintain linear TV while building streaming:

**Benefits:**
- Linear TV generates cash flow to fund streaming investment
- Hedge against uncertainty (if streaming fails, linear still works)
- Reach both older viewers (linear) and younger viewers (streaming)

**[CASE EXAMPLES]**

- **Rogers/Sportsnet:** Linear Sportsnet + Sportsnet NOW streaming
- **Disney:** Linear ESPN + ESPN+ streaming
- **NBC:** Linear NBC Sports + Peacock streaming

**[SUCCESS METRIC]**

The goal: Transition linear viewers to streaming gradually over 5-10 years, maintaining total revenue throughout.

**[WARNING]**

The risk: "Cord-cutting cannibalizes faster than streaming grows." This is what happened to Rogers—lost cable subs before gaining enough streaming subs.

**[FINAL SCREEN: Decision framework]**

**When to Choose Each Model:**

**Choose Linear TV if:**
- You have existing cable/satellite infrastructure
- Targeting older demographics (50+)
- Risk-averse strategy (predictable, declining revenue)

**Choose Streaming if:**
- Targeting younger demographics (18-49)
- Have capital to invest in 3-5 year payback
- High-growth strategy (binary: win big or fail)

**Choose Hybrid if:**
- Want to hedge bets (most common)
- Can afford to operate both models simultaneously
- Transitioning legacy business to future model

**[CLOSING]**

In your Streaming Wars simulation, you'll decide: Linear, streaming, or hybrid? There's no single right answer—but understanding the economics helps you make a defensible choice.

Good luck!
