## SECTION 1: Deal Context (0:00-3:00)

**[OPENING TITLE CARD: "Rogers NHL Deal: 10 Years Later"]**

**[MOTION GRAPHICS: Timeline from 2013 to 2024]**

**NARRATOR:**
In November 2013, Rogers Communications shocked the sports media world with the largest sports rights deal in Canadian history: $5.2 billion over 12 years for exclusive NHL broadcasting rights.

**[ON-SCREEN: Deal Key Terms]**
- $5.2 billion over 12 years (2014-2026)
- ~$433 million per year
- 2.5× more than previous deal
- All platforms: TV, digital, radio, streaming

**NARRATOR:**
At the time, analysts were divided. Some called it brilliant—locking up Canada's favorite sport. Others called it reckless—betting the company on a single property.

**[B-ROLL: Rogers executives celebrating deal announcement, NHL gameplay, Sportsnet branding]**

**NARRATOR:**
Ten years later, the verdict is in: Rogers lost money every single year. By some estimates, they lost $1-1.5 billion over the life of the deal.

But the story is more nuanced than "failed deal." There are lessons here about media strategy, risk management, and the future of sports broadcasting.

Let's examine what went wrong—and what Rogers actually got right.

## SECTION 2: What Went Wrong (3:00-7:00)

**[SECTION TITLE: "What Went Wrong: Three Fatal Flaws"]**

**NARRATOR:**
Rogers made three critical mistakes—each compounding the others.

### Fatal Flaw #1: Overestimated Subscriber Defense (90 seconds)

**[ANIMATION: Chart showing cable subscriber decline 2014-2024]**

**NARRATOR:**
Rogers' core thesis: NHL rights would prevent cord-cutting. They modeled that 500K-1M subscribers would stay on cable because of hockey.

**[ON-SCREEN: Projected vs. Actual Subscriber Retention]**

**NARRATOR:**
Reality: Cord-cutting accelerated anyway. Between 2014 and 2024, Canadian cable/satellite subscribers dropped from 11.2 million to 8.1 million—a 28% decline.

**[EXPERT SOUNDBITE - Media Analyst]:**
"Rogers assumed sports were immune to cord-cutting. But what they missed was the generational shift. Millennials and Gen Z don't watch traditional TV—regardless of what's on it."

**NARRATOR:**
The financial impact? If you retain 200K fewer subscribers than projected, that's $480 million per year in lost revenue—or $5.8 billion over 12 years. The lost subscriber defense alone wiped out the deal's rationale.

---

### Fatal Flaw #2: Underinvested in Streaming Experience (90 seconds)

**[ANIMATION: Comparison of streaming UX - Sportsnet NOW vs competitors]**

**NARRATOR:**
Rogers launched Sportsnet NOW, their streaming platform, in 2016. But it was barebones:
- Just live games (no highlights, replays, or shoulder content initially)
- No fantasy integration
- No social features
- Frequent technical issues (buffering, app crashes)

**[ON-SCREEN: Sportsnet NOW Subscriber Growth vs. Projections]**
- Year 1: 50K subscribers (projected: 200K) ❌
- Year 3: 200K subscribers (projected: 500K) ❌
- Year 5: 350K subscribers (projected: 800K) ❌
- Year 8: 450K subscribers (projected: 1.2M) ❌

**NARRATOR:**
Compare this to NBA League Pass or NFL Game Pass, which offer multi-view, stats overlays, condensed replays, and original content.

**[EXPERT SOUNDBITE - Digital Media Executive]:**
"Sportsnet NOW was streaming as an afterthought—not a strategic priority. They treated it like 'cable on the internet' instead of building a next-generation product."

**NARRATOR:**
The result: Streaming revenue generated only $150 million per year by 2024—less than half what Rogers projected.

---

### Fatal Flaw #3: No Flexibility for Black Swan Events (60 seconds)

**[ANIMATION: COVID-19 impact timeline]**

**NARRATOR:**
In March 2020, COVID-19 shut down sports worldwide. The NHL season was suspended, then resumed with no fans and a shortened schedule.

**[ON-SCREEN: 2020-21 Season Impact]**
- Shortened season: 56 games instead of 82 (-32%)
- No fans in arenas (reduced atmosphere, lower ratings)
- Economic downturn (ad revenue collapsed)

**NARRATOR:**
But here's the kicker: Rogers still paid full rights fees. The contract had no force majeure clause, no revenue-sharing adjustment, no renegotiation trigger.

Result: Rogers lost an estimated $250 million in 2020-21—their worst year of the deal.

**[EXPERT SOUNDBITE - Sports Attorney]:**
"A 12-year deal without flexibility clauses is incredibly risky. The longer the term, the more likely something unpredictable happens. You need protection."

---

## SECTION 3: What Went Right (7:00-11:00)

**[SECTION TITLE: "What Went Right: Underappreciated Wins"]**

**NARRATOR:**
It's tempting to call the Rogers deal a complete failure. But that's not the full story. Rogers did make smart moves—and gained assets that have lasting value.

### Win #1: Maintained Linear + Streaming Hybrid (75 seconds)

**[ANIMATION: Revenue mix - Linear TV vs. Streaming over time]**

**NARRATOR:**
Unlike pure-play streaming services (DAZN, Fubo, FloSports), Rogers kept Sportsnet cable channel strong while building Sportsnet NOW.

This hedging strategy paid off:
- Linear TV generated $2-2.5 billion in ad revenue (2014-2024)
- Cable subscription fees remained stable longer than projected
- When streaming disappointed, linear kept them afloat

**[EXPERT SOUNDBITE - Media Strategist]:**
"Rogers' hybrid model was smart. Many pure streamers failed or got acquired. Rogers survived because they didn't bet everything on streaming working."

**NARRATOR:**
By 2024, the market agrees: Even Netflix and Disney+ are now adding linear-style experiences (live sports, scheduled programming). Rogers was ahead of the curve.

---

### Win #2: Built Brand Equity and Content Library (75 seconds)

**[MONTAGE: Sportsnet branding evolution, iconic broadcast moments]**

**NARRATOR:**
Even though the deal lost money, Rogers gained intangible assets:

**Brand Equity:**
- Sportsnet became synonymous with NHL hockey in Canada
- "Home of Hockey Night in Canada" brand association
- Elevated Sportsnet from #2 to #1 sports network in Canada

**Content Library:**
- 10+ years of NHL broadcast history (replay value, highlight packages)
- Production infrastructure and expertise (reusable for other sports)
- Data and fan insights (viewer behavior, engagement patterns)

**[ON-SCREEN: Estimated Intangible Asset Value]**

**NARRATOR:**
These assets add $500 million to $1 billion to Rogers Media's valuation. If Rogers sells Sportsnet, that NHL legacy is a major selling point.

**[EXPERT SOUNDBITE - Investment Banker]:**
"Financially, the deal was a disaster. But strategically, Rogers secured NHL rights for a generation. That brand positioning has value beyond P&L."

### Win #3: Learned Expensive But Valuable Lessons (75 seconds)

**[ANIMATION: "Lessons Learned" checklist appearing]**

**NARRATOR:**
Rogers made mistakes—expensive ones. But they now know what NOT to do in future deals:

**Lesson 1:** Don't overpay for exclusivity (non-exclusive rights can work)
**Lesson 2:** Invest in streaming UX from Day 1 (content alone isn't enough)
**Lesson 3:** Model worst-case scenarios (external trends trump individual content)
**Lesson 4:** Include flexibility clauses (force majeure, revenue sharing, renegotiation triggers)
**Lesson 5:** Shorter deal terms (5-7 years max, not 12)

**NARRATOR:**
That institutional knowledge is worth $500 million+ in avoided future mistakes.

**[EXPERT SOUNDBITE - Rogers Executive]:**
"We learned hard lessons. But they've shaped how we approach every rights deal since. We're more disciplined, more realistic, and more cautious about long-term bets."

**NARRATOR:**
And the proof? Rogers' recent deals (NBA, MLB, Rogers Cup tennis) have been shorter-term, non-exclusive, and partnered—exactly the opposite of the NHL approach.

## SECTION 4: Lessons for the Industry (11:00-14:00)

**[SECTION TITLE: "Lessons Learned: Industry Takeaways"]**

**NARRATOR:**
The Rogers NHL deal is a case study that every sports media executive studies. Here are the top five lessons:

### Lesson #1: Strategic Value Must Be Measurable (45 seconds)

**[ANIMATION: "Strategic Value" vs "Financial Value" balance scale]**

**NARRATOR:**
Rogers justified the deal by saying "It's not about ad revenue—it's about subscriber defense and brand positioning."

That logic is valid—IF you can prove the causal link. Rogers couldn't.

**[EXPERT SOUNDBITE - CFO Panel]:**
"Strategic value is real, but it can't be an excuse for bad math. If you can't measure it, you can't manage it."

**NARRATOR:**
**Takeaway:** Model strategic value explicitly. If you're betting on subscriber retention, track it monthly. If it's not materializing, have a Plan B.

---

### Lesson #2: Content Is Table Stakes, Experience Drives Retention (40 seconds)

**[ANIMATION: Content vs. Experience - Venn diagram]**

**NARRATOR:**
Having NHL rights wasn't enough. Fans needed a reason to choose Sportsnet NOW over cable, bars, or VPNs.

**[ON-SCREEN: Successful Streaming Services]**
- NBA League Pass: Multi-view, stats overlays, condensed replays
- NFL Game Pass: All-22 film, audio options, classic games library
- DAZN: Multi-sport bundles, flexible pricing, original content

**NARRATOR:**
**Takeaway:** Invest 15-20% of content budget in engagement features. Fantasy integration, social viewing, gamification, and original content reduce churn by 30-40%.

---

### Lesson #3: Flexibility Is Worth the Cost (35 seconds)

**[ANIMATION: Contract flexibility options]**

**NARRATOR:**
Rogers locked in a 12-year exclusive deal with no flexibility. When COVID hit, they had no recourse.

Smarter deal structures include:
- **Force majeure clauses** (pandemics, lockouts, natural disasters)
- **Revenue-sharing adjustments** (if league revenue falls, rights fees adjust)
- **Opt-out windows** (renegotiate every 4 years based on performance)

**NARRATOR:**
**Takeaway:** Pay 5-10% more for flexibility. It's worth it when the unexpected happens.

---

### Lesson #4: Partner to De-Risk (35 seconds)

**[ANIMATION: Partnership models - co-bidding, revenue sharing, tech partnerships]**

**NARRATOR:**
Rogers could have partnered with:
- **Tech companies** (Apple, Amazon) for streaming infrastructure
- **International broadcasters** (shared costs, global reach)
- **Competitors** (co-bid with TSN for non-exclusive rights)

**[EXPERT SOUNDBITE - Deal Advisor]:**
"The lone wolf approach is outdated. Co-investment and strategic partnerships reduce risk while maintaining upside."

**NARRATOR:**
**Takeaway:** Don't go it alone. Partners bring capital, technology, and distribution—reducing your downside while preserving growth.

---

### Lesson #5: Know When to Walk Away (25 seconds)

**[ANIMATION: Walk-away scenarios]**

**NARRATOR:**
The hardest decision is sometimes NOT bidding. Rogers felt pressure to maintain their NHL association. But at $5.2 billion, the price exceeded their rational limit.

**[ON-SCREEN: Walk-Away Checklist]**
- If deal only works in "best case," walk away ✓
- If your bid is 2× higher than competitors, walk away ✓
- If strategic value is unmeasurable, walk away ✓

**NARRATOR:**
**Takeaway:** Set a walk-away price before negotiations. Stick to it, even if it means losing the property.

## CLOSING (13:30-14:00)

**[MONTAGE: NHL highlights, Rogers offices, Sportsnet broadcasts]**

**NARRATOR:**
So, was the Rogers NHL deal a disaster?

**Financially:** Yes. They lost over $1 billion.

**Strategically:** Mixed. They built brand equity, survived the streaming transition, and learned valuable lessons—but at enormous cost.

**Historically:** A turning point. The Rogers deal marked the peak of exclusive, long-term mega-deals. Since then, the industry has shifted toward shorter terms, partnerships, and flexible structures.

**[FINAL EXPERT SOUNDBITE - Industry Analyst]:**
"Rogers bet the company on NHL exclusivity. They lost the bet. But the industry learned from their mistakes. That's worth something."

**[CLOSING TITLE CARD: "What would YOU have done differently?"]**

**NARRATOR:**
As you complete your case analysis, remember: Strategy is about making defensible decisions under uncertainty. Rogers made a bold bet. It didn't pay off. But they had reasons—and you need to understand those reasons to evaluate the decision.

Good luck with your Mini-Case Memo.
