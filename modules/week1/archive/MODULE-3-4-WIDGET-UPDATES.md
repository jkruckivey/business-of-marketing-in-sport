## MODULE 3 WIDGET UPDATES

### Element 4: Revenue Mix Slider ‚úÖ (NO CHANGES - Already Perfect)

**Learner-Facing Introduction (ADD THIS BEFORE THE WIDGET):**

```markdown
### üéØ Interactive Activity: Revenue Mix Slider

**Practice: MLO 1.1 (Map major revenue streams) & MLO 1.3 (Evaluate growth potential and risks)**

You've just learned about the five major revenue streams in professional sport. Now it's time to see how they work together as an ecosystem.

In this interactive activity, you'll build your own revenue portfolio by allocating 100% across the five streams: Media Rights, Ticketing, Sponsorship, Merchandising, and Betting. As you adjust the sliders, you'll see real-time feedback on your portfolio's risk level and growth potential.

**What you'll discover:**
- Why most leagues depend heavily on media rights (40-60%)
- The trade-offs between high-growth streams (Betting) and stable streams (Ticketing)
- How different allocation strategies create different risk profiles

**Time commitment:** 3 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** MLO 1.1 (Mapping revenue streams), MLO 1.3 (Evaluating growth potential and risks)

```markdown
### üéØ Interactive Activity: Media Rights Calculator

**Practice: MLO 1.1 (Map major revenue streams) & MLO 1.3 (Evaluate growth potential)**

You've learned that media rights are the largest revenue stream for most leagues (40-60% of total revenue). But what determines how much a media deal is worth?

In this interactive calculator, you'll input key factors‚Äîleague size, audience reach, advertising rates (CPM), and contract length‚Äîto calculate total media deal value. You'll see how variables like viewership and cost-per-thousand viewers multiply to create deals worth billions.

**What you'll discover:**
- Why the NFL's $110B deal dwarfs other leagues
- How audience size and advertising rates interact
- The impact of contract length on total deal value
- The difference between shared vs. local media revenue

**Time commitment:** 4 minutes

```markdown
### üéØ Interactive Activity: Dynamic Pricing Simulator

**Practice: MLO 1.1 (Understand ticketing mechanics) & MLO 1.3 (Evaluate revenue optimization strategies)**

Ticketing generates 20-30% of team revenue, but not all games are equal. Dynamic pricing lets teams adjust prices based on demand factors‚Äîand can increase annual revenue by 15-25%.

In this simulator, you'll set ticket prices for Toronto Raptors games based on opponent strength, day of week, team record, and special events. Watch how these factors impact attendance and total revenue in real time.

**What you'll discover:**
- Why Lakers tickets cost $400 but Pistons tickets cost $120

### Element 21: Sponsorship ROI Calculator ‚úÖ (NO NAMING CHANGES - ADD LEARNER INTRO)

**Learner-Facing Introduction (ADD THIS BEFORE THE WIDGET):**

```markdown
### üéØ Interactive Activity: Sponsorship ROI Calculator

**Practice: MLO 1.1 (Understand sponsorship mechanics) & MLO 1.3 (Evaluate activation strategies)**

Sponsorship generates 15-25% of team revenue, but not all sponsorships are equal. The best sponsors activate beyond logos‚Äîcreating fan experiences that build positive brand associations.

In this calculator, you'll input deal type (naming rights, jersey patch, category partner), market size, and activation level to calculate brand impressions, estimated brand lift, and deal value. You'll see why activation matters more than logo placement alone.

**What you'll discover:**
- Why Scotiabank Arena costs $40M/year but smaller markets pay $10M
- How "full integration" drives 3-5√ó more value than "logo only"
- The relationship between brand impressions and sponsorship value
- Why sponsors measure success beyond visibility

**Time commitment:** 4 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** MLO 1.1 (Understanding sponsorship revenue stream), MLO 1.3 (Evaluating activation strategies)

**Learner-Facing Introduction (ADD THIS BEFORE THE WIDGET):**

```markdown
### üéØ Interactive Activity: Betting Market Simulator

**Practice: MLO 1.1 (Map emerging revenue streams) & MLO 1.3 (Evaluate growth potential and risks)**

Sports betting is the fastest-growing revenue stream (30-40% year-over-year growth), currently representing 2-8% of league revenue. Legalization has fundamentally changed how leagues monetize fan engagement.

In this simulator, you'll make strategic decisions about betting partnerships, data licensing deals, and media integration. You'll see how different approaches impact revenue, fan engagement, and risk exposure.

**What you'll discover:**
- How betting legalization creates multiple revenue opportunities
- Trade-offs between official partnerships vs. open market approaches
- Why data licensing is a separate (and valuable) revenue stream
- How betting integration drives increased viewership across all content

**Time commitment:** 3 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** MLO 1.1 (Understanding betting revenue stream), MLO 1.3 (Evaluating growth potential and regulatory risks)

---
```

**Technical Specifications:**

### Element 29: Ecosystem Cascade Simulator ‚úÖ (NO NAMING CHANGES - ADD LEARNER INTRO)

**Learner-Facing Introduction (ADD THIS BEFORE THE WIDGET):**

```markdown
### üéØ Interactive Activity: Ecosystem Cascade Simulator

**Practice: MLO 1.1 (See revenue stream interconnections) & MLO 1.2 (Understand sport's unique business model) & MLO 1.3 (Evaluate strategic investments)**

This is where everything comes together. You've explored each revenue stream individually‚Äînow it's time to see how they form an **ecosystem** rather than a portfolio.

In this simulation, you'll analyze the Edmonton Oilers signing Connor McDavid to an $8-year, $100 million contract. At first glance, it looks like a losing investment: $12.5M salary vs. $8M direct revenue. But click to reveal the **indirect effects** and watch the ecosystem amplification unfold.

**What you'll discover:**
- How a single investment cascades through all five revenue streams
- Why teams "overpay" for stars (ecosystem thinking vs. direct ROI)
