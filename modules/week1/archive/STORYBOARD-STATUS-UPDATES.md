# Storyboard Status Updates Needed

## Summary
All 10 widgets have been built and include proper learner-facing intro text. The widget element sections already have the "### ◉ Interactive Activity" format with:
- Practice statement (MLO references)
- Context paragraph
- What you'll discover bullets
- Time commitment
- Learning outcomes practiced

However, the Widget Specifications section (lines 1800-1930) has outdated status markers.

## Widgets with Learner-Facing Intro Text ✅ COMPLETE

All of these already have the proper "### ◉ Interactive Activity" sections:

1. **Revenue Mix Slider** (Element 4, line 356-371) ✅
2. **Media Rights Calculator** (Element 6, line 442-457) ✅
3. **Streaming Wars Decision Game** (Element 11, line 526-541) ✅

All widgets are ready for Uplimit embedding with their intro text already in place.
