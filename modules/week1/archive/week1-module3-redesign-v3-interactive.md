# Module 3 V3 Redesign: Interactive-First Approach

## Problem with V2
Even after V2 redesign, Module 3 still has **~2,650 words** of text broken across 9 sections (200-400 words each). While better than V1, it's still text-heavy and passive.

**Text blocks in V2:**
- Element 1: Introduction (200 words)
- Element 5: Media Rights Part 1 (300 words)
- Element 7: Media Rights Part 2 (300 words)
- Element 9: Ticketing Part 1 (350 words)
- Element 11: Ticketing Part 2 (400 words)
- Element 13: Sponsorship (400 words)
- Element 16: Merchandising & Betting (400 words)
- Element 18: Revenue Ecosystem (350 words)

**Total:** 2,700 words = ~15-18 minutes of continuous reading

## V3 Redesign Philosophy

**"Show, Don't Tell"**

Replace explanatory text with **interactive demonstrations** that let students discover concepts themselves.

**Design Principles:**
1. **No text block over 150 words** (1 minute max)
2. **Interactive widget every 2-3 elements** (not just visual)
3. **Micro-learning**: Bite-sized concept â†’ immediate interaction â†’ reinforcement
4. **Student agency**: Students manipulate variables and see outcomes
5. **Progressive complexity**: Start simple (list), build to complex (simulation)

## Pedagogical Rationale

### Why This Works (Research-Backed)

**1. Active Learning (Bonwell & Eison, 1991)**
- Students construct knowledge through manipulation
- Immediate feedback reinforces understanding
- Discovery learning more memorable than passive reading

**2. Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988)**
- Short text chunks (100 words) prevent working memory overload
- Interactivity provides mental breaks between concepts
- Visual representations reduce cognitive load

**3. Constructivism (Vygotsky)**
- Students build mental models through experimentation
- Widgets provide scaffolding (hints, examples, constraints)
- Social learning via discussion of widget outcomes

**4. Gamification (Deterding et al., 2011)**
- Scenarios and challenges increase motivation
- Immediate feedback creates engagement loop
- Exploration encouraged (try different scenarios)
