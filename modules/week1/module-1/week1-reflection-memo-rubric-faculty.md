## Grading Criteria & Point Allocation

### Criterion 1: Revenue Stream Analysis (30 points)

**What we're measuring:** Bloom's Level 4 (Analyze) - Can they break down revenue vulnerability into component factors?

| Points | Descriptor | Grading Notes |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **27-30** | Identifies stream + 3+ factors + specific data | Look for: Canucks case citations (page #s), TSN video timestamps, quantifiable metrics |
| **24-26** | Identifies stream + 2-3 factors + reasonable support | Acceptable: General case references, some specificity |
| **21-23** | Identifies stream + limited factors or vague support | Red flag: Opinion-based, "I think" language without backup |
| **18-20** | Weak identification or minimal analysis | Needs feedback: "Provide specific evidence from case/video" |
| **0-17** | No clear stream or analysis absent | Fail: Likely didn't complete pre-work or watch video |

**Common Student Errors:**
- Choosing "ticketing" because it's obvious (shows surface thinking)
- Ignoring betting/licensing streams (not in case prominently)
- Confusing vulnerability with current size ("media is biggest so most vulnerable")

**Grade Calibration Examples:**
- **30 pts:** "Linear broadcast rights face 15-20% decline (Canucks p.4) as Gen-Z shifts to streaming (TSN exec @ 24:15). Rogers 12-year $5.2B deal shows inflexibility risk..."
- **27 pts:** "Broadcast rights vulnerable due to cord-cutting. Canucks case shows declining ratings. TSN executive mentioned streaming competition..."
- **24 pts:** "Media rights are most at risk because of streaming services and changing viewer habits."

### Criterion 2: TSN Executive Integration (25 points)

**What we're measuring:** Integration of real-world practitioner insights (Industry relevance)

| Points | Descriptor | Grading Notes |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **23-25** | 3+ specific insights, directly quotes/paraphrases | Must see: Actual executive commentary, not generic "the video said..." |
| **20-22** | 2 insights, clear connection to argument | Acceptable: Paraphrasing with attribution |
| **18-19** | 1 insight or superficial references | Red flag: "The executive discussed..." with no specific content |
| **15-17** | Generic video mention, no real integration | Needs feedback: "Cite specific insights from executive presentation" |
| **0-14** | No video content | Fail: Didn't watch or ignored requirement |

**Common Student Errors:**
- **"The TSN executive said media is important"** (too vague)
- Mixing up Canucks case content with executive commentary
- Only citing Part 1 of video, ignoring Parts 2-3

**Grade Calibration Examples:**
- **25 pts:** "TSN's [Name] explained their rights valuation model: 'We look at 18-49 demo reach, not total viewers' (23:40), which explains why Canucks' aging fanbase..."
- **23 pts:** "The TSN executive mentioned that media companies now value digital rights separately, which supports my argument that traditional broadcast..."
- **20 pts:** "According to the TSN video, streaming is changing how networks bid for rights."

**Grading Tip:** Have the video timestamps ready - if student cites 24:15 and that's accurate, automatic points for specificity.

### Criterion 3: Canucks Case Application (25 points)

**What we're measuring:** Case analysis skills (MBA core competency)

| Points | Descriptor | Grading Notes |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **23-25** | Primary evidence source, cites pages/exhibits, applies revenue sharing | Must see: "Canucks case p.X" or "Exhibit Y shows..." |
| **20-22** | 2-3 specific case elements, clear application | Acceptable: References without page numbers if content is specific |
| **18-19** | Generic case mentions, limited detail | Red flag: "The Canucks..." with no case-specific facts |
| **15-17** | Minimal case use or incorrect interpretation | Needs feedback: "Revisit case exhibits on revenue breakdown" |
| **0-14** | No case content | Fail: Didn't read case or submit case prep |

**Common Student Errors:**
- Treating it like a general NHL team (not using case specifics)
- Missing the revenue sharing angle (MLO 1.4)
- Confusing Canucks with other teams mentioned in readings

**Case Key Facts** (for quick grading reference):
- Rogers 12-year, $5.2B national rights deal (2014-2026)
- Canucks local market: 2.5M metro Vancouver
- Revenue sharing: Small market protection vs large market penalties
- Gate receipts: 40% of team revenue (higher than league average)

**Grade Calibration Examples:**
- **25 pts:** "Canucks' dependence on gate receipts (40% of revenue, case p.3, Exhibit 2) makes them vulnerable to..."
- **23 pts:** "The Canucks case shows they rely heavily on game attendance compared to media rights..."
- **20 pts:** "The Canucks are an example of how Canadian teams face unique revenue challenges."

### Criterion 4: Business Memo Format & Professionalism (20 points)

**What we're measuring:** Professional communication readiness

| Points | Descriptor | Grading Notes |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **18-20** | Perfect format, zero errors, exactly 1 page | Executive-ready: Could send to industry partner |
| **16-17** | Correct format, 1-2 minor errors, on length | Acceptable: Small typos, minor formatting |
| **14-15** | Mostly correct, 3-4 errors, length issues | Red flag: Needs second draft, not polished |
| **12-13** | Format errors, 5+ errors, significantly off length | Needs feedback: Review memo template + proofread |
| **0-11** | Not in memo format or severely deficient | Fail: Submitted wrong format (essay, email, etc.) |

**Required Format Elements:**
```
TO: [Recipient]
FROM: [Student name]
DATE: [Submission date]
RE: Week 1 Reflection - Revenue Vulnerability Analysis

[Opening paragraph]
[Analysis paragraphs]
[Conclusion paragraph]
```

**Common Student Errors:**
- Essay format instead of memo
- Exceeding 1 page (often 1.5 pages - auto deduction)
- Casual language ("I think", "in my opinion") instead of assertive ("Analysis shows", "Evidence indicates")
- Missing headers or incorrect header format

**Grading Shortcut:** If >1 page, automatically cap at 17/20. If not memo format, cap at 13/20.

## Grading Efficiency Tips

### Pre-Grading Setup (5 min total)
1. Have Canucks case open (pages 3-5 most cited)
2. Video timestamp list ready (or skip to key sections)
3. Rubric spreadsheet with point drop-downs

### While Grading (per student: 5-7 min)
1. **Quick scan (30 sec):** Format check, length, headers
2. **Criterion 1 (2 min):** Which stream? How many factors? Any data?
3. **Criterion 2 (1.5 min):** Spot-check video citations (real or vague?)
4. **Criterion 3 (1.5 min):** Page numbers? Exhibits? Revenue sharing mentioned?
5. **Criterion 4 (30 sec):** Grammar check, professionalism scan
6. **Total & feedback (1 min):** Sum points, write 2-3 sentence comment

### Batch Grading Strategy
- Grade all Criterion 1 first, then all Criterion 2, etc. (calibration)
- Or grade 5 full memos, recalibrate, then continue

## Feedback Templates

### High-Performing Students (90+)
> "Excellent analysis with strong evidence from both case and executive video. Your integration of TSN's perspective on [specific point] was particularly insightful. Consider this depth of analysis for future memos."

### Proficient Students (80-89)
> "Solid work identifying [stream] as vulnerable. To reach exemplary level, incorporate more specific data (page numbers, percentages) and additional executive insights from video Parts 2-3."

### Developing Students (70-79)
> "You've identified a reasonable stream, but analysis needs more depth. Review the case prep questions you completed and integrate those insights. Also, cite specific page numbers from Canucks case."

### Beginning Students (60-69)
> "This memo needs significant revision. Please schedule office hours to discuss: 1) How to extract evidence from cases, 2) How to integrate practitioner insights, 3) Business memo format standards."

## Red Flags (Potential Academic Integrity Issues)

⚠️ **Watch for:**
- Suspiciously sophisticated analysis for Week 1
- Identical phrasing between students (collusion)
- Citations to case pages that don't contain that content (didn't read)
- "Executive said" quotes that don't appear in video (fabrication)

**If suspected:** Cross-check with case prep submission and discussion forum activity.

---

## Common Questions from Students (Post-Grade)

**Q: "Why didn't I get full points if I identified the right stream?"**
A: Analysis isn't just identification - need 3+ factors with evidence. Review criterion 1 rubric.

**Q: "I mentioned the video, why low integration score?"**
A: Need *specific* insights, not "the video discussed..." See exemplary examples in student rubric.

**Q: "I was 1.1 pages, why did I lose points?"**
A: Professional constraint. Executives expect concise communication. Edit for brevity next time.

## Calibration Meeting Notes

**Inter-rater reliability check:** Before releasing grades, 3 faculty grade same 5 memos, discuss variances.

**Typical variances:** ±3-5 points acceptable, >5 points needs discussion

**Calibration focal points:**
- What counts as "specific" vs "general" evidence?
- How much TSN content integration is "proficient"?
- When does length violation justify deduction?

---

## Course-Specific Context

**This is Week 1:** Students are learning memo format for first time
- Be strict on format (sets expectations)
- Be somewhat lenient on analysis depth (building skills)
- Emphasize evidence-based writing in feedback

**Revenue Knowledge:** Some students may not know sports business well yet
- Don't penalize for choosing "wrong" stream (no wrong answer if defended)
- Do penalize for weak defense or no evidence

**Case + Executive:** First time synthesizing two sources
- Reward strong integration heavily (this is the goal)
- Provide specific feedback on how to improve synthesis
