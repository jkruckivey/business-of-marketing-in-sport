## PAIRR Implementation Timeline

### Day 1-3: Draft Development
- Students work on 80% complete draft of reflection memo (400-500 words)
- Must include: revenue stream analysis, investment factors, evidence from course content

### Day 4-5: Dual Feedback Phase
**Phase 1:** Peer Review (using structured protocol)
**Phase 2:** AI Feedback (using guided prompts)
Both happen **concurrently** so students receive two perspectives on the same draft

### Day 6: Comparative Reflection
- Students analyze both sources of feedback
- Complete structured reflection (150-200 words)
- Critically evaluate strengths/limitations of peer vs. AI feedback

### Day 7-8: Revision
- Apply insights from both feedback sources
- Prioritize changes based on critical evaluation

### Day 9: Post-Revision Reflection
- Short reflection (100 words): "Which feedback influenced my revisions most? Why?"

### Day 10: Final Submission
- Submit revised memo (500 words max)
- Include post-revision reflection as addendum

# PAIRR Feedback Phase: Peer and AI Review + Reflection

Before submitting your final memo, you'll receive feedback from TWO sources: a classmate and an AI writing assistant. Your task is to **critically evaluate both sources** and decide which feedback to apply.

---

## Step 1: Submit Your Draft (Due: [Date] by 11:59 PM)

Upload your 80% complete draft to the shared Google Drive folder:
- **Format:** Google Doc (enable "Commenting" permissions)
- **Filename:** `YourLastName_ReflectionMemo_Draft.docx`
- **Completeness:** Must have all major sections (not rough notes)

**Draft Requirements:**
- Revenue stream analysis (at least 3 streams)
- Investment factors (2-3 specific recommendations)
- Evidence from course content
- Memo format (To/From/Date/Re)
- 400-500 words (can expand to 500 in revision)

---

## Step 2A: Peer Review (Due: [Date] by 11:59 PM)

You've been paired with a classmate (check announcement for your partner). Complete the structured peer review form for your partner's draft.

**Access Peer Review Form:** [Link to Google Form or PDF]

**Review Focus:**
1. **Revenue Stream Analysis** (10 pts): Are 3+ streams analyzed? Do they show interdependencies?
2. **Investment Factors** (10 pts): Are 2-3 factors specific and well-justified?
3. **Application of Concepts** (5 pts): Do they reference executive session, readings, Canucks case?
4. **Business Communication** (5 pts): Professional format? Clear? Within word limit?

**Time Estimate:** 20-30 minutes

**Reminder:** Be constructive and specific. Your goal is to help your peer improve their work.

---

## Step 2B: AI Feedback (Due: [Date] by 11:59 PM)

Use an AI writing assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini) to get feedback on the same draft you submitted for peer review.

### AI Feedback Prompt Template

**Copy this prompt into your AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.):**

```
You are a business writing coach evaluating a 1-page executive memo for an MBA course assignment. The assignment asks students to advise a private equity firm considering investing in a professional sports team, explaining the unique characteristics of sport's revenue model.

RUBRIC CRITERIA (30 points total):
1. Revenue Stream Analysis (10 pts): Accurately describes and analyzes at least 3 revenue streams. Demonstrates understanding of interdependencies and unique characteristics.
2. Investment Factors (10 pts): Identifies 2-3 specific, well-justified factors that would influence investment decision. Factors are supported with evidence from course content.
3. Application of Concepts (5 pts): Effectively applies concepts from executive session, readings, and case study. Makes relevant connections.
4. Business Communication (5 pts): Professional memo format. Clear, concise writing. Appropriate tone for executive audience. Within 500-word limit.

Please evaluate my draft memo against these criteria. For each criterion:
- Identify what I did well (strengths)
- Identify what could be improved (specific, actionable suggestions)
- Estimate a score (Exceeds/Meets/Developing/Needs Improvement)

Here is my draft:

[PASTE YOUR DRAFT HERE]
```

**Important Instructions:**
1. Use the EXACT prompt above (ensures consistent feedback)
2. Copy the AI's response into a document for later comparison
3. Take screenshots showing the AI conversation (for your reflection)

**Time Estimate:** 5-10 minutes

---

## Step 3: Comparative Reflection (Due: [Date] by 11:59 PM)

Now that you have feedback from BOTH sources, critically compare them.

**Answer these questions in 150-200 words:**

### Question 1: Feedback Quality Comparison
- What did your peer reviewer notice that the AI missed?
- What did the AI notice that your peer missed?
- Were there areas where they disagreed? Which feedback seemed more accurate?

### Question 2: Strengths and Limitations
**Peer Feedback:**
- Strength: [What was most valuable about peer feedback?]
- Limitation: [What was missing or unclear?]

**AI Feedback:**
- Strength: [What was most valuable about AI feedback?]
- Limitation: [What was inaccurate or generic?]

### Question 3: Application Strategy
- Which feedback will you prioritize in your revision? Why?
- What criteria are you using to decide which suggestions to implement?
- How does this exercise change how you'll use AI in future writing tasks?

**Submit your reflection here:** [Link to submission box]

---

## Step 4: Revise Your Memo (Days 7-8)

Apply the insights from BOTH feedback sources:

**Revision Checklist:**
- [ ] Addressed peer feedback on revenue stream analysis
- [ ] Addressed AI feedback on business communication
- [ ] Evaluated competing suggestions and chose best approach
- [ ] Maintained executive memo format and tone
- [ ] Stayed within 500-word limit
- [ ] Cited course content appropriately

**Tip:** You are NOT required to implement ALL suggestions. Use your judgment to prioritize changes that most improve your argument.

---

## Step 5: Post-Revision Reflection (Submit with final memo)

After revising your memo, complete this brief reflection (100 words):

**Prompt:**
"Which feedback source (peer or AI) had the most influence on your revisions? Give 1-2 specific examples of changes you made based on each source. Did the comparative reflection process help you make better revision decisions than you would have with a single feedback source?"

**Format:** Include this reflection as an addendum to your final memo submission (does not count toward 500-word limit).

---

## Grading

**Final Memo:** 30 points (evaluated using original rubric criteria)

**PAIRR Participation Bonus:** Up to 5 bonus points
- Completed peer review form: 2 points
- Obtained AI feedback (verified by screenshot): 1 point
- Completed comparative reflection: 1 point
- Completed post-revision reflection: 1 point

**Total Possible:** 35 points (30 base + 5 bonus)

## Why PAIRR?

**Prepares you for AI-integrated workplaces:**
Sports marketing professionals increasingly use AI tools for content creation, fan engagement analysis, and campaign optimization. This exercise teaches you to:
- Leverage AI for writing improvement (not replacement)
- Critically evaluate AI output (it's not always right!)
- Combine human insight with AI efficiency
- Maintain your voice and strategic thinking

**Benefits you'll experience:**
1. **Multiple perspectives:** Peer sees reader experience; AI sees technical patterns
2. **Critical thinking:** You decide what feedback is valid (not blindly accepting)
3. **Better writing:** Two sources catch more issues than one
4. **Workplace readiness:** Practice balancing AI assistance with human judgment

**Research shows:** Students who use PAIRR write stronger final drafts than those who receive only peer feedback OR only AI feedback. The comparative reflection is the keyâ€”it develops your evaluation skills.

## AI Prompt Engineering Notes

**Why This Specific Prompt:**
1. **Role clarity:** "Business writing coach" frames AI as supportive, not evaluative
2. **Rubric alignment:** Provides exact criteria (prevents AI hallucination of standards)
3. **Structured output:** Requests strengths + suggestions + scores (consistent format)
4. **Evidence-based:** AI must reference specific text from student draft

**Testing Results:**
- ChatGPT 4.0: Excellent structural feedback, sometimes generic on content
- Claude 3 Opus: Strong content analysis, excellent business writing suggestions
- Gemini Advanced: Good balance of structure and content, slightly less detailed

**Recommendation:** Allow students to choose their preferred AI tool (tests critical evaluation across different AI outputs)

## Sample Comparative Reflection (Strong Example)

> "My peer reviewer (Alex) focused heavily on my revenue stream analysis, noting that I treated ticketing and media rights as separate when they're actually interdependent. Alex caught that I never explained HOW signing Connor McDavid would increase media rights valueâ€”just that it would. This was incredibly valuable because the AI completely missed this conceptual gap.
>
> The AI, on the other hand, excelled at business communication critique. It pointed out that my opening paragraph was 150 words of background (way too long for an executive memo) and suggested I lead with my investment recommendation instead. It also caught that I used the term 'ecosystem thinking' without defining it, which assumes the PE firm has sports industry knowledge.
>
> **Peer strength:** Domain-specific insight from someone learning the same content
> **Peer limitation:** Missed structural/formatting issues
>
> **AI strength:** Professional writing standards and executive communication best practices
> **AI limitation:** Couldn't evaluate depth of sports-specific analysis (no knowledge of course content)
>
> **My revision strategy:** I'll prioritize Alex's conceptual feedback (fixing the interdependence gap is critical for scoring well on Criterion 1), then apply AI's structural suggestions (cutting opening to 50 words, defining key terms). This experience taught me that AI is excellent for polishing communication but can't replace human insight on content depth and domain expertise."

**Why This Is Strong:**
- Specific examples from each feedback source
- Identifies strengths AND limitations of both
- Clear prioritization strategy with rationale
- Metacognitive awareness (learning how to use AI effectively)
