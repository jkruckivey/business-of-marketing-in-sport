### Element 1: Bridge Video Scenario
- **File:** `week1-bridge-scenario.mp4`
- **Duration:** 3 minutes
- **Script:** Cold open with real executive dilemma

```
SCRIPT: "The $100 Million Question"

[Executive sitting in boardroom, documents spread on table]

EXECUTIVE: "We just signed Connor McDavid to a $100 million contract.
Our CFO says it's a $12.5 million annual cost. Our ticket sales increased
$5 million. Jersey sales spiked $3 million. That's $8 million in new revenue.

[Pause, looks at camera]

EXECUTIVE: "My board is asking me the obvious question: Why did we just
lose $4.5 million per year on this deal?"

[Cut to title card: "THE BUSINESS OF SPORT - Where the Money Flows"]

NARRATOR: "This week, you'll learn why this executive's answer determines
whether they keep their job. The problem isn't the numbers—it's understanding
how sport revenue works differently than any other business.

By the end of this week, you'll be able to explain why the McDavid contract
is actually worth $30-40 million per year to the organization—if you understand
the revenue ecosystem.

But first: Do you already have the knowledge to solve this problem? Let's find out."
```

### Element 2: Infobox - The Revenue Problem
```
Title: ▲ The Revenue Problem Professional Sport Faces

**The Challenge:**
Professional sports teams operate with a business model that defies conventional
logic. Competitors must collaborate financially. Revenue sources are interdependent,
not independent. Investments in one area create ripple effects you can't predict
without understanding the ecosystem.

**This Week's Big Questions:**
1. Why do teams "overpay" for star players when the math doesn't add up?
2. How do leagues balance entrepreneurial success with competitive fairness?
3. Which revenue streams offer growth—and which are hitting their ceiling?
4. Why does the NFL share 60% of revenue while European soccer teams keep everything?

**Your Mission:**
By the end of this week, you'll solve these problems using real data from the
NHL Vancouver Canucks, the Rogers NHL media deal, and Connor McDavid's contract.

But first: Let's see what you already know.
```

### Element 3: Text - Outcomes as "Can You..." Questions
```markdown
# Can You Solve These Revenue Problems?

Professional sport presents unique business challenges that traditional MBA frameworks
don't fully address. This week tests whether you can apply strategic thinking to an
industry where the rules are different.

## **Challenge 1: Map the Revenue Ecosystem**
**The Problem:** A private equity firm asks you: "Where does sport revenue come from,
and which streams matter most?" Can you map the five major revenue sources and explain
how they interconnect?

**What you'll need to know:**
- Media rights, ticketing, sponsorship, merchandising, betting/gaming
- Relative size and growth trajectory of each stream
- Why sport revenue streams are interdependent (ecosystem vs. portfolio)

**Test yourself now:** Can you name all five major revenue streams and estimate their
percentage of total revenue? (Take the pre-assessment below to find out)

---

## **Challenge 2: Understand Sport's Unique Business Model**
**The Problem:** Your CEO asks: "Why can't we run a sports team like we run our hotel
chain?" Can you explain what makes sport economics fundamentally different?

**What you'll need to know:**
- Why competitors must collaborate financially (revenue sharing, draft systems)
- The concept of competitive balance as an economic asset
- How sport creates value through uncertainty of outcome

**Test yourself now:** Can you explain why the NFL shares 60% of all revenue equally,
and whether that's good or bad for business? (Pre-assessment question 3)

---

## **Challenge 3: Evaluate Growth Potential vs. Risk**
**The Problem:** You have $50 million to invest across five revenue streams. Some offer
high growth but high risk (betting). Others offer stability but limited upside (ticketing).
Can you build a portfolio that maximizes revenue while managing vulnerability?

**What you'll need to know:**
- Which streams are capacity-constrained (ceiling effects)
- Which streams face regulatory or market uncertainty
- How to balance growth, stability, and diversification

**Test yourself now:** Which revenue stream has the highest growth rate right now, and
why? (Pre-assessment question 5)

---

## **Challenge 4: Analyze Revenue Sharing Models**
**The Problem:** The Vancouver Canucks receive $X million from NHL revenue sharing but
contribute $Y million to the pool. The team's owner asks: "Are we better off in a league
with revenue sharing, or should we lobby to change the system?" Can you analyze the
trade-offs?

**What you'll need to know:**
- How the NHL's revenue sharing formula works
- Which teams benefit (small market) vs. which contribute (large market)
- The strategic implications for competitive balance and franchise value

**Test yourself now:** Can you explain one advantage and one disadvantage of revenue
sharing for a mid-market team? (Pre-assessment question 7)

---

## **Ready to Test Your Knowledge?**

Before you dive into this week's content, take the 10-question Revenue Knowledge Quiz
below. This isn't graded—it's a self-diagnostic to help you understand:

✓ What you already know (so you can focus on what's new)
✓ Where you have knowledge gaps (so you know what to prioritize)
✓ How your business intuition applies to sport (or doesn't)

**Your results will give you a personalized learning path for this week.**

Let's see what you've got! 👇
```

### Element 4: iFrame Widget - Revenue Knowledge Pre-Assessment Quiz

**Widget Purpose:** 10-question self-diagnostic quiz covering all 4 learning outcomes

1. **Multiple Choice:** "Which revenue stream accounts for the largest percentage of
   total revenue for most major professional leagues?"
   - A) Ticketing (20-30%)
   - B) Media rights (40-60%) ✓
   - C) Sponsorship (15-25%)
   - D) Merchandising (5-10%)

2. **Short Answer:** "In 2-3 sentences, explain why professional sports teams share
   revenue with competitors."

3. **Scenario:** "The Edmonton Oilers sign Connor McDavid for $12.5M/year. Direct
   revenue increase: $8M. Is this a good investment? Why or why not?"

4. **True/False + Explanation:** "Betting legalization creates only one new revenue
   stream for leagues (betting partnerships). True or False? Explain."

5. **Ranking Task:** "Rank these revenue streams by annual growth rate (fastest to slowest):
   Ticketing, Media Rights, Betting, Sponsorship, Merchandising"

### Element 5: AI Chat Widget - Quiz Results Coach

**Widget Name:** "Quiz Results Coach"

**System Prompt:**
```
You are a supportive learning coach helping MBA students interpret their Revenue Knowledge Pre-Assessment results. Students will share their quiz score (X/10) and assigned level (Revenue Newcomer, Strategic Intuition, Revenue Expert, or Industry Insider). Based on their results:

1. Acknowledge their starting point positively
2. Ask which questions they found most challenging
3. Explain concepts they struggled with in simple terms
4. Provide specific, actionable learning recommendations for this week
5. Connect their gaps to specific modules and sections they should prioritize

The four levels are:
- **0-3/10 (Revenue Newcomer)**: Focus on Module 3 core content, all 8 interactive widgets, executive session. Starting from scratch is actually an advantage—no misconceptions to unlearn.
- **4-6/10 (Strategic Intuition)**: Good business instincts but missing sport-specific knowledge. Focus on sport vs. traditional business differences (Module 3, Section 6), revenue sharing mechanics (Module 5 - Canucks Case), emerging streams like betting (Module 3, Section 5), ecosystem thinking vs. portfolio thinking.
- **7-9/10 (Revenue Expert)**: Strong fundamentals. Challenge with application: Canucks case analysis (Module 5), Revenue Empire Builder strategic simulation (Module 4), Reflection Memo synthesis (Module 6). Help classmates in discussion forums.
- **10/10 (Industry Insider)**: Likely has sport business experience. Validate mental models against academic frameworks, discover new perspectives from executive session, mentor classmates, think ahead to Group Marketing Project application.

Key concepts to explain if students struggled:
- **Revenue ecosystem**: Streams are interdependent, not independent. Investment in one creates cascading effects across all others (e.g., signing Connor McDavid increases ticketing AND media rights AND sponsorship AND merchandising AND betting engagement simultaneously).
- **Competitive balance**: Why competitors must collaborate financially. Without revenue sharing, wealthy teams monopolize talent, creating predictable outcomes that decrease media value for everyone.
- **Appointment viewing**: Sports can't be watched later without spoiler risk from social media. Creates simultaneous audiences (rare in 2024), commanding 3-4× higher ad rates than scripted TV.
- **Premium seating economics**: 10-15% of capacity generates 40-50% of ticketing revenue. Luxury suites ($100K-500K/season) command exponential premiums over general admission.
- **Betting creates multiple streams**: Not just partnerships ($50-200M/year) but also data licensing ($10-50M/year), media integration, and increased viewership (fans with bets watch 30-40% more content).

Be encouraging, specific, and avoid overwhelming students. Help them see this as a helpful diagnostic, not a judgment. Use Socratic questioning to help them discover insights rather than lecturing.
```

**Welcome Message:**
```
Hi! I'm here to help you make sense of your pre-assessment results.

What score did you get on the quiz, and what level did it assign you? (Revenue Newcomer, Strategic Intuition, Revenue Expert, or Industry Insider)

If you'd like, you can also share which questions gave you the most trouble—I can help explain those concepts in a way that might click better for you.
```

**Show System Prompt to User:** No

**Design Rationale:**
- **Interactive vs. static**: Students get personalized coaching instead of choosing from pre-written paths
- **Adaptive explanations**: AI can dig into specific concepts students struggled with (Q3 on McDavid contract, Q4 on betting streams, etc.)
- **Socratic approach**: Helps students discover insights rather than passively receiving recommendations
- **Encouraging tone**: Normalizes struggle, frames gaps as opportunities, maintains growth mindset
- **Specific guidance**: Points to exact modules and sections based on identified weaknesses
- **Meta-learning**: Helps students become better self-directed learners by modeling how to interpret diagnostic results

```
The Business of Sport: A Unique Revenue Ecosystem

Professional sport operates unlike any other industry. Teams compete on the field
but must collaborate financially to maintain competitive balance. Revenue streams
are interdependent—strong media rights deals fund player salaries, which attract
talent, which creates compelling content, which increases media value.

This week, we explore the five major revenue streams that power professional sport:
media rights, ticketing and attendance, sponsorship and partnerships, merchandising,
and the emerging betting/gaming sector. We'll examine not just how money flows IN,
but how it flows BETWEEN stakeholders through complex revenue sharing arrangements.

You'll learn why the NFL shares 60% of all revenue equally among teams, while
European soccer operates on a more entrepreneurial model. You'll understand why
the NBA invested billions in creating its own streaming infrastructure, and why
betting legalization fundamentally changes sport's economic equation.

# Understanding Sport Revenue Streams

Professional sports organizations generate revenue through five major streams, each with distinct characteristics, risks, and growth trajectories. Unlike traditional businesses where revenue sources operate independently, sport revenue streams are deeply interconnected—creating what industry experts call a **"revenue ecosystem"** rather than a portfolio.

**The Five Major Revenue Streams:**

1. **Media Rights** (40-60% of revenue) - Broadcasting and streaming deals
2. **Ticketing & Live Events** (20-30% of revenue) - Gate receipts and in-venue spending
3. **Sponsorship & Partnerships** (15-25% of revenue) - Corporate deals and brand alignment
4. **Merchandising & Licensing** (5-10% of revenue) - Apparel and licensed products
5. **Betting & Gaming** (2-8% and growing) - The emerging frontier

As you work through this module, pay attention to how these streams interconnect. An investment in one area often creates ripple effects across the entire ecosystem—a principle that separates strategic sports business leaders from purely financial operators.

### ◉ Interactive Activity: Revenue Mix Slider

**Practice: MLO 1.1 (Map major revenue streams) & MLO 1.3 (Evaluate growth potential and risks)**

You've just learned about the five major revenue streams in professional sport. Now it's time to see how they work together as an ecosystem.

In this interactive activity, you'll build your own revenue portfolio by allocating 100% across the five streams: Media Rights, Ticketing, Sponsorship, Merchandising, and Betting. As you adjust the sliders, you'll see real-time feedback on your portfolio's risk level and growth potential.

**What you'll discover:**

- Why most leagues depend heavily on media rights (40-60%)
- The trade-offs between high-growth streams (Betting) and stable streams (Ticketing)
- How different allocation strategies create different risk profiles

**Time commitment:** 3 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** MLO 1.1 (Mapping revenue streams), MLO 1.3 (Evaluating growth potential and risks)

---

**Widget Purpose:** Interactive portfolio builder where students allocate 100% across 5 revenue streams and see real-time feedback on risk/growth projections.

**How It Works:**
- 5 sliders for each revenue stream (Media Rights, Ticketing, Sponsorship, Merchandising, Betting)
- Sliders automatically adjust so total = 100%
- Real-time pie chart visualization
- Risk score calculated (weighted by stream risk levels)
- Growth projection calculated (weighted by stream growth trends)
- Export allocation as JSON for student portfolios

**Learning Objectives:**
- MLO 1.1: Understand relative size of each revenue stream
- MLO 1.3: Explore trade-offs between high-growth (high-risk) and stable streams

# Media Rights: The Dominance

Media rights—the fees paid by broadcasters and streaming services to air games—represent the **largest revenue stream** for most professional leagues, typically accounting for **40-60% of total revenue**.

These deals are massive: the NFL's current media rights contracts total **$110 billion over 11 years** ($10B/year), while the English Premier League generates over **$5 billion per year** from domestic and international broadcast rights.

**Why Sports Command Premium Value:**
- **Cost per thousand viewers (CPM)** for premium sports: **$50-70**
- **CPM for scripted television:** **$15-25**
- **Premium multiplier:** Sports command **3-4× higher advertising rates**

For leagues, broadcast deals provide **predictable, long-term revenue** (often 9-12 year contracts), allowing teams to make long-term financial commitments like player contracts and facility investments.
```

#### Element 6: iFrame Widget - Media Rights Calculator

### ◉ Interactive Activity: Media Rights Calculator

**Practice: MLO 1.1 (Map major revenue streams) & MLO 1.3 (Evaluate growth potential)**

You've learned that media rights are the largest revenue stream for most leagues (40-60% of total revenue). But what determines how much a media deal is worth?

In this interactive calculator, you'll input key factors—league size, audience reach, advertising rates (CPM), and contract length—to calculate total media deal value. You'll see how variables like viewership and cost-per-thousand viewers multiply to create deals worth billions.

**What you'll discover:**
- Why the NFL's $110B deal dwarfs other leagues
- How audience size and advertising rates interact
- The impact of contract length on total deal value
- The difference between shared vs. local media revenue

**Time commitment:** 4 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** MLO 1.1 (Understanding media rights mechanics), MLO 1.3 (Evaluating what drives growth)

---

**Widget Purpose:** Calculate media rights value based on inputs (league size, audience, ad rates, contract length).

**Widget Status:** ✅ Phase 2 widget - BUILT AND READY

**How It Works:**
- **Inputs:** League size, audience (millions), ad rate (CPM), contract length
- **Outputs:** Total deal value, per-team share, % of revenue
- **Examples:** NFL ($110B), NHL ($5.2B), MLS ($250M)
- **Learning:** Understand what drives media rights valuation
- **Bonus:** Toggle "shared vs. local" to see revenue sharing impact

#### Element 7: Infobox - Appointment Viewing Insight
```
Title: ▶ Key Insight: "Appointment Viewing"

Sports are the last true appointment viewing—you can't watch "later" without risking spoilers from social media. This creates predictable, simultaneous audiences (rare in 2024), premium advertising rates, subscription retention power, and cultural currency. This unique characteristic explains why sports rights command prices that seem economically irrational—until you understand their strategic defensive value for traditional broadcasters and offensive value for streaming disruptors.

# The Streaming Wars

The rise of streaming has fundamentally disrupted sports media economics. Companies like Amazon, Apple, and DAZN have entered bidding wars, driving rights values higher while introducing new business models.

**How Streaming Differs from Traditional Broadcasting:**

Streaming platforms operate with fundamentally different economics than traditional TV. They use subscription-based revenue models instead of advertising, offer global distribution instead of regional licensing, collect detailed viewer analytics instead of aggregated ratings, and accept 3-5 year payback periods instead of immediate ROI expectations.

**The Hybrid Model Emerges:**

Leagues increasingly split rights packages to maximize total revenue: sell traditional TV rights to one partner (NBC, ESPN), sell streaming rights to another (Apple, Amazon), and create direct-to-consumer platforms (NBA League Pass, NHL.TV). This **"hybrid model"** hedges against uncertainty about the future of television while capturing value from both worlds.
```

#### Element 10: Table - Streaming vs Traditional Comparison

| **Factor** | **Traditional TV** | **Streaming** |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Revenue model** | Advertising-dependent | Subscription-based |
| **Geographic reach** | Regional licensing | Global distribution |
| **Engagement data** | Aggregated ratings (Nielsen) | Detailed viewer analytics |
| **Profitability timeline** | Immediate ROI expectations | 3-5 year payback periods |

**Table Note:** "Streaming platforms' different economics explain why tech companies can outbid traditional broadcasters—they're valuing strategic fit, not just immediate revenue."

#### Element 11: iFrame Widget - Streaming Wars Decision Game

### ◉ Interactive Activity: Streaming Wars Decision Game

**Practice: MLO 1.1 (Understand media rights options) & MLO 1.3 (Evaluate strategic trade-offs)**

Leagues increasingly face a critical question: traditional TV with guaranteed revenue, or streaming with global reach and uncertain returns? The NHL, NBA, and NFL have all split rights packages to hedge their bets.

In this decision game, you're the NHL commissioner choosing between two media offers: ESPN (traditional, $8B/10 years, advertising-based) or Apple TV+ (streaming, $10B/10 years, subscription-based, global reach). You'll see 5-year financial projections and understand why "hybrid deals" became the industry standard.

**What you'll discover:**
- Why streaming offers higher total value but more uncertainty
- The trade-offs between guaranteed ad revenue vs. subscription growth
- How cord-cutting trends impact long-term broadcast value
- Why leagues split rights packages instead of choosing one platform

**Time commitment:** 5 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** MLO 1.1 (Understanding media rights landscape), MLO 1.3 (Evaluating strategic media decisions)

# Ticketing: The Live Experience

Ticketing and live event revenue—including ticket sales, premium seating, and in-venue spending—accounts for **20-30% of total revenue** for most teams. Unlike media rights, which are negotiated at the league level and often shared, ticketing revenue is largely **local and team-controlled**.

**Dynamic Pricing Revolution:**

Teams now adjust ticket prices based on demand factors: opponent quality (Lakers vs. Pistons), team performance (playoff contention), day of week (weekend vs. weekday), and special events (giveaways, rivalries). The Toronto Raptors might charge **$150** for a Tuesday game against Detroit, but **$400** for a Saturday game against the Lakers.

Over a full season, dynamic pricing can **increase ticketing revenue by 15-25%** compared to static pricing.
```

#### Element 13: iFrame Widget - Dynamic Pricing Simulator

### ◉ Interactive Activity: Dynamic Pricing Simulator

**Practice: MLO 1.1 (Understand ticketing mechanics) & MLO 1.3 (Evaluate revenue optimization strategies)**

```markdown
# The Premium Seating Strategy

The evolution of stadium economics has shifted dramatically from a **"fill the seats"** model to a **"maximize per-capita revenue"** model. Modern venues are designed with tiered experiences that extract maximum value from affluent customers.

**Premium Seating Tiers:**

- **Luxury Suites:** $100,000-500,000 per season (12-24 seats, catering, private rooms)
- **Club Seats:** $5,000-15,000 per seat per season (exclusive lounges, premium sight lines)
- **Courtside/Field Level:** $500-2,000+ per game (celebrity seating, concierge service)

**The Critical Economic Insight:** Premium seating generates 40-50% of ticketing revenue despite representing only 10-15% of capacity. This explains why virtually every stadium renovation prioritizes premium inventory expansion.
```

#### Element 16: iFrame Widget - Stadium Revenue Optimizer

### ◉ Interactive Activity: Stadium Revenue Optimizer

**Practice: MLO 1.1 (Understand ticketing revenue structure) & MLO 1.3 (Evaluate revenue optimization strategies)**

Modern stadium economics have shifted from a "fill the seats" model to a "maximize per-capita revenue" model. Premium seating (luxury suites, club seats) represents only 10-15% of capacity but generates 40-50% of ticketing revenue.

In this optimizer, you'll design the seating mix for an 18,000-seat arena by adjusting the percentage of luxury suites, club seats, and general admission. Watch how total revenue changes as you prioritize premium inventory—and discover why virtually every stadium renovation expands premium seating.

**What you'll discover:**
- Why 10-15% of capacity generates 40-50% of revenue
- The trade-off between maximizing revenue and maintaining fan accessibility
- How premium seating pricing creates exponential returns
- Why teams prioritize luxury suite expansion in renovations

**Time commitment:** 4 minutes

Title: ◆ Key Insight: Premium Seat Economics

Premium seating represents only 10-15% of total venue capacity but generates 40-50% of total ticketing revenue. Luxury suites ($100K-500K per season), club seats ($5K-15K per seat), and courtside/field level tickets ($500-2,000+ per game) command exponential premiums over general admission seating. This revolutionary insight transformed modern stadium design—virtually every renovation or new construction prioritizes premium inventory expansion because 20-30 new luxury suites generate more revenue than 2,000 upper bowl seats combined.
```

#### Element 18: Details - PSL Case Study
```
Title: Personal Seat Licenses (PSLs) - SoFi Stadium Case

[Expand for case study]

Some teams sell **Personal Seat Licenses**—one-time fees (often $5,000-75,000) for the right to purchase season tickets in premium locations.

**SoFi Stadium (Rams/Chargers) Case:**
- Generated over **$600 million** from PSL sales
- Funds stadium construction without increasing team debt
- PSL owners pay $5K-$75K upfront, THEN pay for season tickets annually

**Controversy:**
Fans pay thousands just for the *right* to buy expensive tickets. This creates accessibility issues but provides massive upfront capital for stadium construction.

**Beyond the Ticket:**
Total non-ticket revenue can reach **$40-50 per attendee** (concessions $15-30, parking $20-100, merchandise). This turns a $100 ticket into **$140-150 in total venue spending**—why teams view declining attendance as a crisis affecting the entire in-venue ecosystem.

# Sponsorship: Brand Alignment and Activation

Corporate sponsorship represents **15-25% of revenue** for most professional teams, with higher percentages in markets with deep-pocketed corporations.

**Major Sponsorship Categories:**

- **Naming Rights:** Scotiabank Arena (Toronto) ~$40M/year, Chase Center (Warriors) ~$15M/year
- **Jersey Sponsorship:** Warriors + Rakuten ~$20M/year, Lakers + Bibigo ~$12-14M/year
- **Category Partnerships:** "Official beer," "official airline," "official bank" ($500K-$10M/year)

**Activation: Beyond the Logo**

The best sponsors **activate** beyond logos—creating fan experiences that build positive associations. Scotiabank's "Scene+ Night" at Leafs games integrates loyalty programs with exclusive ticket offers and in-arena experiences. Delta's Lakers partnership includes exclusive lounges, travel content series, and behind-the-scenes player content.

# Merchandising: Brand Extension

Merchandising and licensing revenue represents **5-10% of revenue** for most teams. Professional leagues take different approaches:

**Centralized Model (NFL, NHL, MLB):** League office manages all licensing. Revenue pooled and distributed equally to all teams. Protects small-market teams from imbalance.

**Decentralized Model (European Soccer):** Teams control their own merchandise rights. Popular clubs generate 10-20× more than smaller clubs. Rewards brand-building but creates wealth disparity.

**Key Revenue Drivers:** Championship runs (sales increase 200-400% during playoffs), star acquisitions (LeBron's Lakers trade = $1M+ in jersey sales within hours), and new designs (NBA "City Edition" jerseys generate $100M+ annually).
```

# Revenue Interdependence: The Ecosystem Principle

The critical insight that distinguishes expert sports business analysts from novices: **Revenue streams don't exist in isolation—they form an ecosystem.**

Consider the Edmonton Oilers signing Connor McDavid to an **8-year, $100 million contract** ($12.5M per year). Direct revenue from his impact: ticket sales increase ~$5M/year, merchandise sales spike ~$3M/year. Total direct revenue: ~$8M/year.

At first glance, this seems like a **losing investment**—paying $12.5M to generate $8M.

But this analysis misses the **ecosystem amplification**: media rights value increases (+$10M annually), sponsorship renewals at premium rates (+$5M annually), playoff revenue ($15-20M per deep run), franchise valuation increase ($50-100M), and betting engagement (+$2M annually).

**Total ecosystem value: $30-40M+ annually**—far exceeding the $12.5M salary cost.

This explains why teams "overpay" for stars. They're investing in **ecosystem amplification** across media, sponsorship, merchandise, and brand value.
```

Title: ■ Activity: Build Your Revenue Empire

### ◉ Interactive Activity: Revenue Empire Builder

**Practice: MLO 1.1 (Apply revenue stream knowledge) & MLO 1.3 (Evaluate growth potential and manage risks)**

You've explored each revenue stream through interactive simulations. Now it's time to put it all together and build a complete revenue strategy.

You are the new CFO of a mid-market professional sports team. Your challenge: maximize revenue over a 5-year period by strategically investing $50M across the five revenue streams. You'll make year-by-year decisions, respond to market events, and balance growth against risk.

**What you'll practice:**
- Allocating budget across media rights, ticketing, sponsorship, merchandising, and betting
- Managing portfolio risk vs. growth potential
- Responding to market events (recessions, new competitors, regulatory changes)
- Understanding how revenue streams create synergies

**Strategic considerations:**
- Media rights provide stability but require long-term contracts
- Ticketing is capacity-limited (ceiling on growth)
- Sponsorship takes time to build but can be very profitable
- Betting offers high growth but carries regulatory risk
- Diversification helps weather market changes

**Time commitment:** 30-45 minutes (can be completed in multiple sessions)
**Learning outcomes practiced:** MLO 1.1 (Applying revenue stream knowledge), MLO 1.3 (Evaluating growth potential and managing risks)

---

Learning Objectives:
• Apply MLO 1.1: Understand how revenue streams work together
• Apply MLO 1.3: Evaluate growth potential and risks of each stream

Instructions:
1. Allocate your $50M investment budget across the 5 revenue streams
2. Make year-by-year decisions about reinvestment
3. Respond to market events and opportunities
4. Achieve the target revenue growth while managing risk

Time: 30-45 minutes | Can be completed in multiple sessions

### Element 3: Text Content (Reflection Prompt)
```
After completing the Revenue Empire Builder:

Reflect on your strategic decisions:
• Which revenue stream did you invest in most heavily? Why?
• What surprised you about how the streams interacted?
• How did market events (e.g., recession, new competitor) impact your strategy?
• If you played again, what would you do differently?

This activity prepares you for the case study analysis in Module 5, where you'll
evaluate real revenue decisions made by the Vancouver Canucks.

### Element 4: AI Chat Widget Configuration
- **Widget Name:** "Strategy Assistant"
- **System Prompt:** "You are a helpful business strategy advisor for MBA students learning about sports revenue. Provide hints and guidance for the Revenue Empire Builder activity. Don't give direct answers, but ask Socratic questions to help students think through their strategy. Focus on: diversification, risk management, growth potential, and revenue stream interactions."
- **Welcome Message:** "Working on your revenue strategy? I can help you think through your investment decisions. What part of your strategy are you considering?"

Title: ◆ Strategy Hints (Open if you're stuck)

Not sure how to approach this? Here are some strategic considerations:

**Diversification:**
Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Even high-growth streams have risks.
A balanced portfolio can weather market changes better.

**Media Rights:**
High revenue potential but requires long-term contracts. Once you commit, you're
locked in. Make sure you're negotiating from strength (winning teams get better deals).

**Ticketing:**
Capacity-limited. You can only sell so many seats. Premium seating and dynamic
pricing can increase yield, but there's a ceiling. Consider this a stable base,
not a growth engine.

**Sponsorship:**
Relationship-dependent. Building strong partnerships takes time but can be very
profitable. Brand alignment matters - don't just chase the biggest check.

**Betting/Gaming:**
High growth potential but regulatory risk. Early movers can capture value, but
stay flexible in case laws change.

**Key Question:**
Which streams create synergies? (Hint: Better players → better content → higher
media rights → more resources for players...)
```

**Design Rationale:**
- **iFrame widget** provides hands-on, experiential learning (UDL engagement, Application level)
- **Infobox** clearly frames the task and connects to MLOs (QM clarity)
- **Reflection prompt** encourages metacognition and transfer (deeper learning)
- **AI Chat** offers adaptive support based on student needs (UDL scaffolding)
- **Details** provides hints without giving answers (progressive disclosure for struggling learners)
- Multiple paths to success - no single "right" strategy (UDL choice)
- Directly supports MLO 1.3 (evaluating growth potential and risks) through authentic practice

### Element 3: Details - Rubric Examples Content
```
Title: Rubric Details & Example Excerpts

[Expand to see evaluation criteria and examples]

## Revenue Stream Analysis (10 points)

**Excellent (9-10 pts):**
"Demonstrates sophisticated understanding of at least 3 revenue streams, explaining
not just what they are but how they interconnect. For example, shows how media
rights value depends on competitive talent, which requires revenue sharing to
maintain balance."

**Example Excerpt:**
"Media rights generate 55% of NHL revenue, but this value depends entirely on
competitive balance maintained through revenue sharing. Without sharing, wealthy
teams would monopolize talent, creating predictable outcomes that decrease media
value for all. The Canucks benefit from shared national media revenue ($XX million)
but must compete for scarce local sponsorship dollars..."

**Proficient (7-8 pts):**
"Accurately describes 3+ revenue streams with some analysis of characteristics.
May miss some interdependencies or deeper implications."

**Developing (5-6 pts):**
"Lists revenue streams but provides limited analysis. May treat streams as
independent rather than interconnected."

**Needs Improvement (0-4 pts):**
"Describes fewer than 3 streams, or descriptions are inaccurate or incomplete."

---

## Investment Factors (10 points)

**Excellent (9-10 pts):**
"Identifies 2-3 specific, defensible investment factors supported by evidence.
Factors show strategic thinking and business acumen."

**Example Excerpt:**
"Two factors would drive my investment decision: (1) Revenue sharing stability—
leagues with proven revenue sharing models (like the NFL) protect downside risk,
and (2) Emerging stream potential—teams with rights to betting partnerships and
digital content can capture high-growth revenue outside traditional sharing pools."

**Proficient (7-8 pts):**
"Identifies 2-3 reasonable factors with some justification. May lack specificity
or deep supporting evidence."

✓ Revenue streams are interdependent, not independent
✓ Sport's business model is unique—competition on field, collaboration on economics
✓ Revenue sharing creates competitive balance but constrains entrepreneurial upside
✓ Growth opportunities exist at the frontier (betting, streaming, international)

This foundation prepares you for Week 2, where we'll dive deep into media rights
and fan engagement monetization—two of the highest-value and fastest-changing
revenue streams.

Well done! ✓

### Element 2: Text Content - Group Marketing Project Connection
```
## Connecting to Your Group Marketing Project

As you begin thinking about your Group Marketing Project (60% of final grade),
consider how this week's content applies:

Your task will be to develop a comprehensive marketing plan for a sport organization.
Revenue strategy is the foundation of any marketing plan—you can't make strategic
marketing decisions without understanding revenue generation and constraints.

Questions to consider as you form your project team and select your organization:
• Which revenue streams offer the most growth potential for your chosen organization?
• How does revenue sharing (if applicable) constrain or enable marketing strategy?
• What emerging revenue streams (betting, NFTs, metaverse) could your organization leverage?
• How can marketing investments increase multiple revenue streams simultaneously?

We'll explore these questions throughout the course. By Week 5, you'll integrate
everything into a cohesive marketing strategy.

Start thinking about project teams and organization selection. More details in
the Project Guide (available on course homepage).
```

### Element 3: Text Content - Week 2 Preview

You'll explore:
• How media rights are valued and negotiated
• The shift from traditional broadcasting to streaming
• Fan engagement strategies and monetization
• Major deals analysis (e.g., Rogers/NHL $5.2 billion)

Executive Leader: [Name, Title]
Core Case: Rogers Communications and the NHL Rights Deal

**PLUS: Anchor Project Launch!** ◉
Week 2 marks the beginning of your course-long Anchor Project (60% of final grade).
You'll form teams of 5-6 students and select a sport property to analyze over the
remaining weeks. Start thinking about potential teammates and organizations that
interest you!

**Estimated Time Commitment:** Week 2 = 7-9 hours total (includes 2-3 hours for team
formation and property selection)

Get ready for another intensive week of learning! See you in Week 2.
