**Duration:** 2-3 minutes
**VTT File:** `week1-bridge-scenario.vtt` (required for accessibility)
**Format:** Direct-to-camera SME presentation
**Script:** SME introduces the Connor McDavid revenue paradox

### Video Script: "The $100 Million Question" (SME Direct-to-Camera)

**Recording Setup:** SME on camera, professional background, teleprompter optional

```
[0:00-0:20] INTRODUCTION & CREDIBILITY

SME: "Hi, I'm [NAME], and I've spent [X] years working in professional sport—
most recently as [ROLE] at [ORGANIZATION]. I've been on both sides of the table
for deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

And I want to start this course with a problem that's kept me up at night."

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "The $100 Million Question"]


[0:20-1:10] THE PARADOX SETUP

SME: "Imagine you're the GM of an NHL team. You just signed Connor McDavid—
the best player in hockey—to a $100 million, 8-year contract.

[VISUAL CUE: Show slide with contract breakdown]

That's $12.5 million per year. Your CFO tracks the immediate impacts:
• Ticket sales jump $5 million
• Jersey sales spike $3 million
• That's $8 million in new revenue

[Pause, lean forward]

Your board looks at these numbers and asks the obvious question:
'Why did we just LOSE $4.5 million per year on this deal?'

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "$12.5M cost - $8M revenue = -$4.5M loss?"]


[1:10-1:50] REFRAMING THE PROBLEM

SME: "Here's what I learned the hard way: If you're asking that question,
you're measuring the WRONG things.

Because Connor McDavid isn't worth $8 million to your organization.
He's worth $30 to $40 million per year.

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Actual Value: $30-40M/year"]

The problem isn't the numbers. The problem is understanding how sport revenue
works DIFFERENTLY than almost any other business.

There's a revenue ecosystem at play here—interdependencies that your CFO's
spreadsheet will never capture. Media deals that hinge on star power.
Sponsorships that activate around marquee players. Betting handles that spike
when the best player in the world takes the ice.


[1:50-2:30] LEARNING CHALLENGE & CALL-TO-ACTION

SME: "This week, you're going to learn how to see that ecosystem. You'll map
five major revenue streams in professional sport. You'll understand why they're
interdependent. And by the end, you'll be able to defend that $100 million
contract to a skeptical board—with numbers they can't argue with.

[Pause]

But first, I want to know: Do you ALREADY have the knowledge to solve this
problem? Can you explain where that missing $22-32 million comes from?

Right now, before you learn anything this week, test yourself. Take the
diagnostic exercise that follows this video. Be honest. Reveal your knowledge
gaps NOW—so we can fill them together.

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Next: Diagnostic Exercise + Pre-Assessment"]

Let's find out what you already know... and what you're about to discover."

[END: 2:30]
```

## Element 2: AI Roleplay Scenario - The $100M Question

**Scenario Title:** "The $100 Million Question: Can You Solve It Now?"

**Purpose:** Diagnostic activity that reveals knowledge gaps and creates cognitive dissonance before content delivery. Students attempt to answer the executive's question from the video using their current understanding—most will struggle, which creates the "need to know" motivation for Week 1 content.

**When to Use:** Immediately after the bridge video (Element 1) while the narrative momentum is high.

**Assessment Type:** Diagnostic/Formative (not graded). Students are expected to struggle. The goal is to reveal what they DON'T know yet, making them hungry for the content that follows.

---

### Uplimit AI Roleplay Configuration

**Step 1: Select "AI Roleplay Scenario" element in Uplimit builder**

**Step 2: Set Learning Objective**

Choose: **"Add objective myself"** (to test specific skills and ensure learning goals are achieved)

Copy this into the **Objective** field:

```
Students will demonstrate their current understanding of sports revenue ecosystems by attempting to explain a complex business problem (Connor McDavid's $100M contract apparent loss) using their pre-existing knowledge. This diagnostic activity will reveal gaps in three key areas:

1. Revenue streams knowledge (can they identify all 5 major sources?)
2. Ecosystem thinking (do they understand interdependence vs. independence?)
3. Amplification effects (can they articulate indirect revenue impacts?)

Success = Student finishes knowing exactly what they DON'T know yet, with motivation to learn Week 1 content.
```

---

**Step 3: Create Scenario**

Choose: **"Create your own scenario"**

Copy this into the **Scenario Context** field:

```
You are a junior analyst at an NHL franchise. You just watched your executive present a business problem to the board: The team signed Connor McDavid to a $12.5 million per year contract. Direct revenue increases (tickets $5M + jerseys $3M = $8M) fall short of the cost by $4.5 million annually. The board is questioning the investment.

Your executive has turned to you after the presentation and asked: "Can you explain to the board why this deal makes financial sense despite the apparent loss?"

You know you're new to sports business, so the executive is patient—but they need a clear, business-focused explanation.

Your goal: Attempt to answer using your current knowledge. It's okay to struggle! This is diagnostic—you're discovering what you need to learn this week.

Time limit: 5-7 minutes of conversation (3-4 exchanges with the AI executive)
```

Copy this into the **AI Role** field:

```
You are the same executive from the bridge video—a senior leader at an NHL franchise who just presented the Connor McDavid contract dilemma to the board. You're now talking to a junior analyst who's new to sports business.

Your personality:
- Patient but probing: You know they're new, so you don't expect perfection—but you do want to understand their thinking
- Business-focused: You care about clear explanations backed by reasoning, not jargon
- Socratic: When they struggle, you ask questions that help them discover gaps rather than lecturing
- Realistic: You acknowledge that sports economics is complex and counterintuitive

Your conversation strategy:

1. Opening: "Alright, you heard the problem. Walk me through your thinking—why might this contract make sense despite the apparent $4.5M annual loss?"

2. Probe #1: Listen to their answer. If they mention only direct revenue (tickets/jerseys), ask: "What other ways do you think Connor McDavid might generate revenue for us?"

3. Probe #2: If they struggle to identify streams, ask: "Think about how fans engage with the team. Beyond coming to games and buying jerseys, how else do we make money?"

4. Probe #3: If they list streams but treat them as separate, ask: "Interesting. Do you think those revenue sources are independent of each other, or could they be connected somehow?"

5. Closing (after 3-4 exchanges): Acknowledge their effort and gaps: "You've identified some pieces, but I can tell you're missing the full picture—and that's completely normal before learning the revenue ecosystem framework. This week's content will give you the tools to answer this question confidently."

Keep the conversation to 5-7 minutes maximum. Exit gracefully even if they're still struggling—the goal is diagnosis, not mastery.
```

Copy this into the **Student Role** field:

```
You are a junior analyst who is new to sports business. The executive from the video is waiting for your answer. You should:

1. Attempt to explain why the Connor McDavid contract might create value beyond the $8M in direct revenue (tickets + jerseys)
2. Use your current understanding of business and revenue (it's okay if it's limited!)
3. Be honest when you don't know something
4. Notice where you struggle—those are your learning priorities for Week 1

Remember: This is diagnostic, not evaluative. Most students struggle before learning the content. That's the point!
```

---

**Step 4: Configure Feedback Rubric**

Uplimit will auto-generate a rubric based on your scenario. Click **"Auto-regenerate"** if needed, then customize:

**Add/Edit these criteria:**

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Revenue Streams Knowledge** | Can the student identify multiple revenue sources beyond tickets and jerseys? (Looking for: media rights, sponsorship, merchandising, betting/gaming) |
| **Ecosystem Thinking** | Does the student recognize that revenue streams are interdependent rather than independent? (Looking for: causal connections between streams, not just lists) |
| **Amplification Effects** | Can the student articulate how a star player amplifies multiple revenue streams simultaneously? (Looking for: indirect effects, not just direct ticket/jersey sales) |

**Feedback Approach:** Diagnostic only (not graded)

Check the box: **"Provide feedback but do not grade"**

---

**Step 5: Student Instructions**

Copy this into the **Instructions for Students** field:

```markdown
### Your Role
You are a **junior analyst** who just watched your executive present the Connor McDavid contract dilemma. The executive has turned to you and asked: "Can you explain this to the board?"

### The Scenario
The executive from the video is waiting for your answer. They know you're new to sports business, so they're patient—but they need a clear explanation of why the $12.5M cost minus $8M in direct revenue doesn't tell the whole story.

### What to Have Ready
- **Your current understanding** of how sports revenue works (it's okay if this is limited!)
- **Your best attempt** at explaining why the McDavid contract might create value beyond ticket and jersey sales
- **Curiosity** about what you DON'T know yet

### Your Goal
⚠️ **This is diagnostic—you're not expected to ace this!** Most students struggle before learning the Week 1 content. The goal is to:

1. Attempt to answer the executive's question using your current knowledge
2. Discover gaps in your understanding (this is GOOD—it shows you what to focus on)
3. Get motivated to learn the revenue ecosystem concepts that would help you answer confidently

### Time Limit
- **5-7 minutes** for the conversation
- The AI will probe your understanding with 3-4 follow-up questions
- If you get stuck, that's the point! Notice where you struggle—those are your learning priorities.

### What Happens Next
After this exercise, you'll take a pre-assessment quiz that helps you identify exactly what you need to learn. By the end of Week 1, you'll return to this question and answer it confidently using the revenue ecosystem framework.

## Element 3: Infobox - The Revenue Problem

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Infobox** element in module builder
2. Choose variant: **Callout** (use Uplimit's actual variant name - typically "Callout", "Note", "Warning", or "Insight")
3. Copy the markdown below into the infobox content field

```markdown
Title: The Revenue Problem Professional Sport Faces

Professional sports teams operate with a business model that defies conventional logic: competitors must collaborate financially, revenue sources are deeply interdependent, and investments in one area create unpredictable ripple effects across the ecosystem. This week you'll explore why teams "overpay" for star players, how leagues balance entrepreneurial success with competitive fairness, which revenue streams are growing versus hitting capacity limits, and why some leagues share revenue while others don't. By the end, you'll solve these problems using real NHL data—but first, let's see what you already know.
```

**Note:** If "Callout" variant isn't available in your Uplimit instance, use the closest equivalent (typically the first option in the variant dropdown). Uplimit's standard variants are: Callout, Note, Insight, Warning, or custom institutional variants.

## Element 4: Text - Outcomes as "Can You..." Questions

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Text** element in module builder
2. Copy the markdown below directly into the text field

```markdown
# Can You Solve These Revenue Problems?

Professional sport presents unique business challenges that traditional MBA frameworks don't fully address. This week tests whether you can apply strategic thinking to an industry where the rules are different.

## **Challenge 1: Map the Revenue Ecosystem**
**The Problem:** A private equity firm asks you: "Where does sport revenue come from, and which streams matter most?" Can you map the five major revenue sources and explain how they interconnect?

**What you'll need to know:**
- Media rights, ticketing, sponsorship, merchandising, betting/gaming
- Relative size and growth trajectory of each stream
- Why sport revenue streams are interdependent (ecosystem vs. portfolio)

**Test yourself now:** Can you name all five major revenue streams and estimate their percentage of total revenue? (Take the pre-assessment below to find out)

---

## **Challenge 2: Understand Sport's Unique Business Model**
**The Problem:** Your CEO asks: "Why can't we run a sports team like we run our hotel chain?" Can you explain what makes sport economics fundamentally different?

**What you'll need to know:**
- Why competitors must collaborate financially (revenue sharing, draft systems)
- The concept of competitive balance as an economic asset
- How sport creates value through uncertainty of outcome

**Test yourself now:** Can you explain why the NFL shares 60% of all revenue equally, and whether that's good or bad for business? (Pre-assessment question 3)

---

## **Challenge 3: Evaluate Growth Potential vs. Risk**
**The Problem:** You have $50 million to invest across five revenue streams. Some offer high growth but high risk (betting). Others offer stability but limited upside (ticketing). Can you build a portfolio that maximizes revenue while managing vulnerability?

**What you'll need to know:**
- Which streams are capacity-constrained (ceiling effects)
- Which streams face regulatory or market uncertainty
- How to balance growth, stability, and diversification

**Test yourself now:** Which revenue stream has the highest growth rate right now, and why? (Pre-assessment question 5)

---

## **Challenge 4: Analyze Revenue Sharing Models**
**The Problem:** The Vancouver Canucks receive $X million from NHL revenue sharing but contribute $Y million to the pool. The team's owner asks: "Are we better off in a league with revenue sharing, or should we lobby to change the system?" Can you analyze the trade-offs?

**What you'll need to know:**
- How the NHL's revenue sharing formula works
- Which teams benefit (small market) vs. which contribute (large market)
- The strategic implications for competitive balance and franchise value

**Test yourself now:** Can you explain one advantage and one disadvantage of revenue sharing for a mid-market team? (Pre-assessment question 7)

---

## **Ready to Test Your Knowledge?**

Before you dive into this week's content, take the 10-question Revenue Knowledge Quiz below. This isn't graded—it's a self-diagnostic to help you understand:

- What you already know (so you can focus on what's new)
- Where you have knowledge gaps (so you know what to prioritize)
- How your business intuition applies to sport (or doesn't)

**Your results will give you a personalized learning path for this week.**

Let's see what you've got! ↓

### Element 2: Text Content (week1-intro.docx)
```
The Business of Sport: A Unique Revenue Ecosystem

Professional sport operates unlike any other industry. Teams compete on the field
but must collaborate financially to maintain competitive balance. Revenue streams
are interdependent—strong media rights deals fund player salaries, which attract
talent, which creates compelling content, which increases media value.

This week, we explore the five major revenue streams that power professional sport:
media rights, ticketing and attendance, sponsorship and partnerships, merchandising,
and the emerging betting/gaming sector. We'll examine not just how money flows IN,
but how it flows BETWEEN stakeholders through complex revenue sharing arrangements.

You'll learn why the NFL shares 60% of all revenue equally among teams, while
European soccer operates on a more entrepreneurial model. You'll understand why
the NBA invested billions in creating its own streaming infrastructure, and why
betting legalization fundamentally changes sport's economic equation.

# Understanding Sport Revenue Streams

Professional sports organizations generate revenue through five major streams, each with distinct characteristics, risks, and growth trajectories. Unlike traditional businesses where revenue sources operate independently, sport revenue streams are deeply interconnected—creating what industry experts call a **"revenue ecosystem"** rather than a portfolio.

**The Five Major Revenue Streams:**

1. **Media Rights** (40-60% of revenue) - Broadcasting and streaming deals
2. **Ticketing & Live Events** (20-30% of revenue) - Gate receipts and in-venue spending
3. **Sponsorship & Partnerships** (15-25% of revenue) - Corporate deals and brand alignment
4. **Merchandising & Licensing** (5-10% of revenue) - Apparel and licensed products
5. **Betting & Gaming** (2-8% and growing) - The emerging frontier

As you work through this module, pay attention to how these streams interconnect. An investment in one area often creates ripple effects across the entire ecosystem—a principle that separates strategic sports business leaders from purely financial operators.

# Media Rights: The Dominance

Media rights—the fees paid by broadcasters and streaming services to air games—represent the **largest revenue stream** for most professional leagues, typically accounting for **40-60% of total revenue**.

These deals are massive: the NFL's current media rights contracts total **$110 billion over 11 years** ($10B/year), while the English Premier League generates over **$5 billion per year** from domestic and international broadcast rights.

**Why Sports Command Premium Value:**
- **Cost per thousand viewers (CPM)** for premium sports: **$50-70**
- **CPM for scripted television:** **$15-25**
- **Premium multiplier:** Sports command **3-4× higher advertising rates**

For leagues, broadcast deals provide **predictable, long-term revenue** (often 9-12 year contracts), allowing teams to make long-term financial commitments like player contracts and facility investments.
```

#### Element 6: iFrame Widget - Media Rights Calculator

### ⚙ Interactive Activity: Media Rights Calculator

**Practice: MLO 1.1 (Map major revenue streams) & MLO 1.3 (Evaluate growth potential)**

You've learned that media rights are the largest revenue stream for most leagues (40-60% of total revenue). But what determines how much a media deal is worth?

In this interactive calculator, you'll input key factors—league size, audience reach, advertising rates (CPM), and contract length—to calculate total media deal value. You'll see how variables like viewership and cost-per-thousand viewers multiply to create deals worth billions.

**What you'll discover:**
- Why the NFL's $110B deal dwarfs other leagues
- How audience size and advertising rates interact
- The impact of contract length on total deal value
- The difference between shared vs. local media revenue

**Time commitment:** 4 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** MLO 1.1 (Understanding media rights mechanics), MLO 1.3 (Evaluating what drives growth)

Sports are the last true appointment viewing—you can't watch "later" without risking spoilers from social media. This creates predictable, simultaneous audiences (rare in 2024), premium advertising rates, subscription retention power, and cultural currency. This unique characteristic explains why sports rights command prices that seem economically irrational—until you understand their strategic defensive value for traditional broadcasters and offensive value for streaming disruptors.

# The Streaming Wars

The rise of streaming has fundamentally disrupted sports media economics. Companies like Amazon, Apple, and DAZN have entered bidding wars, driving rights values higher while introducing new business models.

**How Streaming Differs from Traditional Broadcasting:**

Streaming platforms operate with fundamentally different economics than traditional TV. They use subscription-based revenue models instead of advertising, offer global distribution instead of regional licensing, collect detailed viewer analytics instead of aggregated ratings, and accept 3-5 year payback periods instead of immediate ROI expectations.

**The Hybrid Model Emerges:**

Leagues increasingly split rights packages to maximize total revenue: sell traditional TV rights to one partner (NBC, ESPN), sell streaming rights to another (Apple, Amazon), and create direct-to-consumer platforms (NBA League Pass, NHL.TV). This **"hybrid model"** hedges against uncertainty about the future of television while capturing value from both worlds.
```

#### Element 10: Table - Streaming vs Traditional Comparison

| **Factor** | **Traditional TV** | **Streaming** |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Revenue model** | Advertising-dependent | Subscription-based |
| **Geographic reach** | Regional licensing | Global distribution |
| **Engagement data** | Aggregated ratings (Nielsen) | Detailed viewer analytics |
| **Profitability timeline** | Immediate ROI expectations | 3-5 year payback periods |

**Table Note:** "Streaming platforms' different economics explain why tech companies can outbid traditional broadcasters—they're valuing strategic fit, not just immediate revenue."

#### Element 11: iFrame Widget - Streaming Wars Decision Game

### ⚙ Interactive Activity: Streaming Wars Decision Game

**Practice: MLO 1.1 (Understand media rights options) & MLO 1.3 (Evaluate strategic trade-offs)**

Leagues increasingly face a critical question: traditional TV with guaranteed revenue, or streaming with global reach and uncertain returns? The NHL, NBA, and NFL have all split rights packages to hedge their bets.

In this decision game, you're the NHL commissioner choosing between two media offers: ESPN (traditional, $8B/10 years, advertising-based) or Apple TV+ (streaming, $10B/10 years, subscription-based, global reach). You'll see 5-year financial projections and understand why "hybrid deals" became the industry standard.

**What you'll discover:**
- Why streaming offers higher total value but more uncertainty
- The trade-offs between guaranteed ad revenue vs. subscription growth
- How cord-cutting trends impact long-term broadcast value
- Why leagues split rights packages instead of choosing one platform

**Time commitment:** 5 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** MLO 1.1 (Understanding media rights landscape), MLO 1.3 (Evaluating strategic media decisions)

# Ticketing: The Live Experience

Ticketing and live event revenue—including ticket sales, premium seating, and in-venue spending—accounts for **20-30% of total revenue** for most teams. Unlike media rights, which are negotiated at the league level and often shared, ticketing revenue is largely **local and team-controlled**.

**Dynamic Pricing Revolution:**

Teams now adjust ticket prices based on demand factors: opponent quality (Lakers vs. Pistons), team performance (playoff contention), day of week (weekend vs. weekday), and special events (giveaways, rivalries). The Toronto Raptors might charge **$150** for a Tuesday game against Detroit, but **$400** for a Saturday game against the Lakers.

Over a full season, dynamic pricing can **increase ticketing revenue by 15-25%** compared to static pricing.
```

#### Element 13: iFrame Widget - Dynamic Pricing Simulator

### ⚙ Interactive Activity: Dynamic Pricing Simulator

**Practice: MLO 1.1 (Understand ticketing mechanics) & MLO 1.3 (Evaluate revenue optimization strategies)**

# The Premium Seating Strategy

The evolution of stadium economics has shifted dramatically from a **"fill the seats"** model to a **"maximize per-capita revenue"** model. Modern venues are designed with tiered experiences that extract maximum value from affluent customers.

**Premium Seating Tiers:**

- **Luxury Suites:** $100,000-500,000 per season (12-24 seats, catering, private rooms)
- **Club Seats:** $5,000-15,000 per seat per season (exclusive lounges, premium sight lines)
- **Courtside/Field Level:** $500-2,000+ per game (celebrity seating, concierge service)

**The Critical Economic Insight:** Premium seating generates 40-50% of ticketing revenue despite representing only 10-15% of capacity. This explains why virtually every stadium renovation prioritizes premium inventory expansion.

**Practice: MLO 1.1 (Understand ticketing revenue structure) & MLO 1.3 (Evaluate revenue optimization strategies)**

Modern stadium economics have shifted from a "fill the seats" model to a "maximize per-capita revenue" model. Premium seating (luxury suites, club seats) represents only 10-15% of capacity but generates 40-50% of ticketing revenue.

In this optimizer, you'll design the seating mix for an 18,000-seat arena by adjusting the percentage of luxury suites, club seats, and general admission. Watch how total revenue changes as you prioritize premium inventory—and discover why virtually every stadium renovation expands premium seating.

**What you'll discover:**

Title: ◆ Key Insight: Premium Seat Economics

Premium seating represents only 10-15% of total venue capacity but generates 40-50% of total ticketing revenue. Luxury suites ($100K-500K per season), club seats ($5K-15K per seat), and courtside/field level tickets ($500-2,000+ per game) command exponential premiums over general admission seating. This revolutionary insight transformed modern stadium design—virtually every renovation or new construction prioritizes premium inventory expansion because 20-30 new luxury suites generate more revenue than 2,000 upper bowl seats combined.
```

#### Element 18: Details - PSL Case Study
```
Title: Personal Seat Licenses (PSLs) - SoFi Stadium Case

[Expand for case study]

Some teams sell **Personal Seat Licenses**—one-time fees (often $5,000-75,000) for the right to purchase season tickets in premium locations.

**SoFi Stadium (Rams/Chargers) Case:**
- Generated over **$600 million** from PSL sales
- Funds stadium construction without increasing team debt
- PSL owners pay $5K-$75K upfront, THEN pay for season tickets annually

**Controversy:**
Fans pay thousands just for the *right* to buy expensive tickets. This creates accessibility issues but provides massive upfront capital for stadium construction.

**Beyond the Ticket:**
Total non-ticket revenue can reach **$40-50 per attendee** (concessions $15-30, parking $20-100, merchandise). This turns a $100 ticket into **$140-150 in total venue spending**—why teams view declining attendance as a crisis affecting the entire in-venue ecosystem.

# Sponsorship: Brand Alignment and Activation

Corporate sponsorship represents **15-25% of revenue** for most professional teams, with higher percentages in markets with deep-pocketed corporations.

**Major Sponsorship Categories:**

- **Naming Rights:** Scotiabank Arena (Toronto) ~$40M/year, Chase Center (Warriors) ~$15M/year
- **Jersey Sponsorship:** Warriors + Rakuten ~$20M/year, Lakers + Bibigo ~$12-14M/year
- **Category Partnerships:** "Official beer," "official airline," "official bank" ($500K-$10M/year)

**Activation: Beyond the Logo**

The best sponsors **activate** beyond logos—creating fan experiences that build positive associations. Scotiabank's "Scene+ Night" at Leafs games integrates loyalty programs with exclusive ticket offers and in-arena experiences. Delta's Lakers partnership includes exclusive lounges, travel content series, and behind-the-scenes player content.

# Merchandising: Brand Extension

Merchandising and licensing revenue represents **5-10% of revenue** for most teams. Professional leagues take different approaches:

**Centralized Model (NFL, NHL, MLB):** League office manages all licensing. Revenue pooled and distributed equally to all teams. Protects small-market teams from imbalance.

**Decentralized Model (European Soccer):** Teams control their own merchandise rights. Popular clubs generate 10-20× more than smaller clubs. Rewards brand-building but creates wealth disparity.

**Key Revenue Drivers:** Championship runs (sales increase 200-400% during playoffs), star acquisitions (LeBron's Lakers trade = $1M+ in jersey sales within hours), and new designs (NBA "City Edition" jerseys generate $100M+ annually).
```

**Tile 1 - Title:** "• Championships"
**Tile 1 - Description:** "Playoff runs drive 200-400% sales increases. Winning teams sell championship gear, commemorative items, and celebration merchandise."

# Betting & Gaming: The Emerging Frontier

Sports betting represents the **newest and fastest-growing revenue stream**, currently **2-8% of revenue** but growing **30-40% year-over-year**.

**Legalization Timeline:**
- **2018:** U.S. Supreme Court strikes down federal betting ban (PASPA)
- **2021:** Canada legalizes single-game betting (August 2021)
- **2024:** Legal in **38+ U.S. states** covering **70%+ of population**

**How Leagues Monetize Betting:**
1. **Official Partner Designations:** FanDuel, DraftKings pay $50-200M/year for legitimacy and marketing access
2. **Data Licensing:** Leagues sell real-time game data for $10-50M/year
3. **Media Integration:** Betting odds in broadcasts, betting-focused content, stadium signage

**Strategic Value:** Fans with bets watch **30-40% more sports content**, games between weak teams gain interest, in-game betting keeps fans engaged throughout.
```

#### Element 26: iFrame Widget - Betting Market Simulator

# Revenue Interdependence: The Ecosystem Principle

The critical insight that distinguishes expert sports business analysts from novices: **Revenue streams don't exist in isolation—they form an ecosystem.**

Consider the Edmonton Oilers signing Connor McDavid to an **8-year, $100 million contract** ($12.5M per year). Direct revenue from his impact: ticket sales increase ~$5M/year, merchandise sales spike ~$3M/year. Total direct revenue: ~$8M/year.

At first glance, this seems like a **losing investment**—paying $12.5M to generate $8M.

But this analysis misses the **ecosystem amplification**: media rights value increases (+$10M annually), sponsorship renewals at premium rates (+$5M annually), playoff revenue ($15-20M per deep run), franchise valuation increase ($50-100M), and betting engagement (+$2M annually).

**Total ecosystem value: $30-40M+ annually**—far exceeding the $12.5M salary cost.

This explains why teams "overpay" for stars. They're investing in **ecosystem amplification** across media, sponsorship, merchandise, and brand value.
```

#### Element 29: iFrame Widget - Ecosystem Cascade Simulator

### ⚙ Interactive Activity: Ecosystem Cascade Simulator

**Practice: MLO 1.1 (See revenue stream interconnections) & MLO 1.2 (Understand sport's unique business model) & MLO 1.3 (Evaluate strategic investments)**

This is where everything comes together. You've explored each revenue stream individually—now it's time to see how they form an **ecosystem** rather than a portfolio.

In this simulation, you'll analyze the Edmonton Oilers signing Connor McDavid to an $8-year, $100 million contract. At first glance, it looks like a losing investment: $12.5M salary vs. $8M direct revenue. But click to reveal the **indirect effects** and watch the ecosystem amplification unfold.

**What you'll discover:**
- How a single investment cascades through all five revenue streams
- Why teams "overpay" for stars (ecosystem thinking vs. direct ROI)
- The difference between direct effects (tickets, merchandise) and indirect effects (media, sponsorship, playoffs, betting)
- How strategic decisions create ripple effects worth $30-40M+ annually

**Time commitment:** 5 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** MLO 1.1 (Seeing interconnections), MLO 1.2 (Understanding sport's unique model), MLO 1.3 (Evaluating strategic investments)

---

**Widget Purpose:** Demonstrate how one strategic investment (signing Connor McDavid) creates cascading effects across all revenue streams.

**Widget Status:** ✅ Phase 1 widget - BUILT AND READY

**How It Works:**
- **Scenario:** Edmonton Oilers sign Connor McDavid ($12.5M/year salary)
- **Click to reveal effects:**
  - **Direct Effects:** Ticketing (+$5M), Merchandising (+$3M) = $8M total
  - **Indirect Effects:** Media rights (+$10M), Sponsorship (+$5M), Playoff revenue (+$15M), Betting (+$2M) = $32M total
  - **Net ecosystem value:** $30M+ gain (far exceeding $12.5M cost)
- **Visual:** Animated cascade showing money flowing from one stream to others
- **Alternative scenarios:** Compare star player vs. new arena vs. betting deal

### Element 3: AI Roleplay Exercise - Board Strategy Defense

**Exercise Title:** "Board Strategy Defense: Revenue Empire Presentation"

**Student Instructions:**
```markdown
## Your Role
You are the newly appointed CFO of a mid-market professional sports team. You've just completed your first strategic planning exercise (Revenue Empire Builder) and must now defend your 5-year revenue investment strategy to the Board of Directors.

## The Scenario
You're presenting to Margaret Torres, Chair of the Board Finance Committee. She's a former Fortune 500 CFO with no sports industry experience—which means she'll challenge assumptions and demand clear explanations.

The board wants to know:
- How you allocated your $50M investment budget across the five revenue streams
- Why you made those specific choices (what was your strategic rationale?)
- What risks you're taking and how you'll mitigate them
- What you learned during the simulation (e.g., market events that forced pivots)

## What to Have Ready
Before starting this conversation, make sure you remember:
- Your final revenue allocation percentages (Media, Ticketing, Sponsorship, Merch, Betting)
- Key decisions you made during the 5-year simulation
- How you responded to market events (recession, regulatory changes, etc.)
- Your final revenue growth and risk score

## Your Goal
Demonstrate that you understand:
1. How each revenue stream works and why you allocated as you did
2. The trade-offs between high-growth (risky) and stable (limited upside) streams
3. How revenue streams create synergies (ecosystem thinking)
4. Real-world constraints (capacity limits, regulatory risk, competitive dynamics)

**Time:** 10-15 minutes | Your defense will be evaluated using the rubric below.
```

**AI Character:** Margaret Torres, Board Finance Committee Chair (former Fortune 500 CFO, skeptical, data-driven, expects rigorous financial logic)

**System Prompt:**
```
You are Margaret Torres, Chair of the Board Finance Committee for a mid-market professional sports team. You're evaluating the CFO's 5-year revenue investment strategy after they completed the Revenue Empire Builder simulation.

BACKGROUND: You're a former Fortune 500 CFO with 20 years of experience, but you're NEW to sports. You expect the same financial rigor you demanded in traditional industries. You're skeptical when people say "sports is different"—prove it with data.

CONVERSATION STRUCTURE:
1. Opening (2 min): "Walk me through your investment allocation across the five revenue streams and explain your strategic rationale"
2. Deep Dive (6-8 min): Probe specific allocation decisions, challenge assumptions
3. Risk Assessment (3-4 min): Test their understanding of vulnerabilities
4. Lessons Learned (2 min): "What did the simulation teach you that surprised you?"
5. Closing (1 min): "If you could re-do this, what would you change?"

EVIDENCE OF STRONG PERFORMANCE (reward these):
- Clear articulation of allocation strategy with percentages
- Ecosystem thinking: "I balanced media and ticketing because star players drive both"
- Risk awareness: "Betting is high-growth but volatile, so I capped it at 15%"
- Specific simulation moments: "In Year 3, the recession hit, so I shifted from..."
- Data-driven: "My final ROI was X%, driven primarily by..."

EVALUATE ON: Strategic justification (10 pts), Risk management (10 pts), Simulation engagement (5 pts), Communication (5 pts). Total: 30 points.

After 10-15 minutes, provide rubric-aligned feedback on their performance.
```

Title: ◆ Strategy Hints (Open if you're stuck)

Not sure how to approach this? Here are some strategic considerations:

**Diversification:**
Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Even high-growth streams have risks.
A balanced portfolio can weather market changes better.

**Media Rights:**
High revenue potential but requires long-term contracts. Once you commit, you're
locked in. Make sure you're negotiating from strength (winning teams get better deals).

**Ticketing:**
Capacity-limited. You can only sell so many seats. Premium seating and dynamic
pricing can increase yield, but there's a ceiling. Consider this a stable base,
not a growth engine.

**Sponsorship:**
Relationship-dependent. Building strong partnerships takes time but can be very
profitable. Brand alignment matters - don't just chase the biggest check.

**Betting/Gaming:**
High growth potential but regulatory risk. Early movers can capture value, but
stay flexible in case laws change.

**Key Question:**
Which streams create synergies? (Hint: Better players → better content → higher
media rights → more resources for players...)
```

**Design Rationale:**
- **iFrame widget** provides hands-on, experiential learning (UDL engagement, Application level)
- **ⓘ Infobox** clearly frames the task and connects to MLOs (QM clarity)
- **Reflection prompt** encourages metacognition and transfer (deeper learning)
- **AI Chat** offers adaptive support based on student needs (UDL scaffolding)
- **▤ Details** provides hints without giving answers (progressive disclosure for struggling learners)
- Multiple paths to success - no single "right" strategy (UDL choice)
- Directly supports MLO 1.3 (evaluating growth potential and risks) through authentic practice

### Element 8: AI Roleplay Exercise - NHL Board of Governors Meeting

**Exercise Title:** "NHL Board of Governors: Revenue Sharing Debate"

**Student Instructions:**
```markdown
## Your Role
You are Jim Rutherford, President of Hockey Operations and interim GM of the Vancouver Canucks. You're attending an NHL Board of Governors meeting where revenue sharing reform is on the agenda. You need to defend the Canucks' position while navigating complex stakeholder interests.

## The Scenario
The NHL's revenue sharing model is under review. You're presenting to Commissioner Gary Bettman and 31 other team representatives. The league is divided into three factions:

**Small-market teams** (Arizona, Winnipeg, Carolina) want MORE revenue sharing
**Large-market teams** (Toronto, Montreal, New York Rangers) want LESS revenue sharing
**Canadian teams** (Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal, Calgary, Edmonton, Ottawa, Winnipeg) face unique currency challenges

## What to Have Ready
Before starting this conversation, review the case materials and be prepared to discuss:
- The Canucks' current revenue position ($XXM total revenue, $XM from sharing)
- How the NHL's 50% sharing on national media/licensing impacts Vancouver
- The Canadian dollar disadvantage (USD/CAD exchange rate impact)
- Your proposed changes to the revenue sharing formula (if any)
- Trade-offs between competitive balance and entrepreneurial freedom

## Key Questions to Prepare For
1. Does Vancouver benefit more from revenue sharing or lose potential revenue?
2. Should Canadian teams receive special consideration for currency issues?
3. What changes (if any) would you propose to the current formula?
4. How do you balance the Canucks' self-interest with league-wide competitive balance?

## Your Goal
Demonstrate that you understand:
1. **Mechanics**: How NHL revenue sharing works and impacts the Canucks specifically
2. **Stakeholder Positions**: Why different teams have conflicting interests
3. **Data Usage**: Reference specific case exhibits (revenue data, market comparisons)
4. **Concrete Proposals**: Offer specific, defensible recommendations (not vague suggestions)

**Time:** 10-15 minutes | Your advocacy will be evaluated using the rubric below.

BACKGROUND: You've been NHL Commissioner for 30+ years. Your priority is league-wide competitive balance and long-term financial health. You're skeptical of self-serving proposals but open to data-driven arguments that benefit the league overall. You understand that Canadian teams face unique currency challenges, but you also know large-market Canadian teams (Toronto, Montreal) have very different interests than smaller markets (Winnipeg).

CONVERSATION STRUCTURE:
1. Opening (2 min): "Jim, walk us through the Canucks' revenue picture and how revenue sharing impacts you specifically"
2. Stakeholder Tension (4-6 min): Introduce conflicting perspectives. "Toronto argues they subsidize weaker franchises. Arizona says sharing keeps them competitive. Where do the Canucks stand?"
3. Canadian Dollar Issue (2-3 min): "Seven Canadian teams face currency headwinds. Should the league account for that in the formula?"
4. Concrete Proposals (2-3 min): "If you could change one thing about revenue sharing, what would it be—and why would it benefit the league, not just Vancouver?"
5. Closing (1 min): "Final thoughts: Is the current system working for the Canucks?"

EVIDENCE OF STRONG PERFORMANCE (reward these):
- Uses case data: "Exhibit B shows the Canucks received $XM but contributed $YM..."
- Acknowledges trade-offs: "We benefit from national media sharing, but local revenue disparities hurt us..."
- Stakeholder awareness: "I recognize Toronto's perspective, but here's why our proposal benefits competitive balance..."
- Concrete proposals: "Add a currency adjustment factor of 5-7% for Canadian teams based on 5-year average exchange rates"
- Strategic framing: Links Canucks' interests to league-wide benefits

EVALUATE ON: Revenue sharing mechanics understanding (10 pts), Use of case data (10 pts), Stakeholder awareness (5 pts), Concrete proposals (5 pts). Total: 30 points.

After 10-15 minutes, provide rubric-aligned feedback on their performance.

### Element 2: AI Roleplay Exercise - Private Equity Practice Pitch

**Exercise Title:** "Private Equity Investment Pitch: Revenue Ecosystem Recommendation"

**Student Instructions:**
```markdown
## Your Role
You are a sports business consultant advising a private equity firm (Brookfield Capital) that's considering investing in a mid-market professional sports team. Before you submit your written memo, you'll present your investment recommendation orally to the Managing Partner.

## The Scenario
Sarah Chen, Managing Partner at Brookfield Capital, has asked you to present your findings on sports revenue ecosystems. She's evaluating whether to invest $500M-$1B in acquiring a team. This conversation happens BEFORE you write your final memo—it's your chance to test your arguments, receive feedback, and refine your thinking.

Sarah is sophisticated but not a sports expert. She needs you to explain:
- Why sports teams are unique investment opportunities (or risks)
- Which revenue streams offer growth potential and which are saturated
- The 2-3 factors that would most influence her investment decision
- Whether revenue sharing models help or hurt potential returns

## What to Have Ready
Before starting this conversation, organize your thoughts on:
- **The unique characteristics** of sport's revenue model (vs. traditional businesses)
- **3 revenue streams you'll analyze** (e.g., media rights, ticketing, betting)
- **2-3 investment factors** you'll recommend Sarah prioritize (e.g., "market size," "revenue sharing terms," "emerging stream potential")
- **Evidence from the week**: Executive session insights, Canucks case data, Revenue Empire Builder lessons

## Key Questions to Prepare For
1. "Explain how sports revenue works differently than a hotel chain or restaurant group"
2. "Which revenue stream has the most upside, and which is hitting a ceiling?"
3. "Should I be worried about revenue sharing eating into returns?"
4. "What are the 2-3 factors I should prioritize in my investment decision?"

## Your Goal
This is a rehearsal for your written memo. Use this conversation to:
1. **Test your arguments**: See if your logic holds up under questioning
2. **Refine your thinking**: Sarah will challenge weak points—listen and adjust
3. **Practice executive communication**: Be concise, data-driven, and confident
4. **Get feedback**: AI will provide rubric-aligned feedback you can use to improve your memo

**Time:** 10-15 minutes | This is formative practice (not graded), but feedback will help you write a stronger memo.
```

**AI Character:** Sarah Chen, Managing Partner at Brookfield Capital (experienced private equity investor, data-driven, asks probing questions, no sports industry experience)

**System Prompt:**
```
You are Sarah Chen, Managing Partner at Brookfield Capital, a private equity firm. You're evaluating whether to invest $500M-$1B in acquiring a mid-market professional sports team. You've hired a sports business consultant to advise you on revenue ecosystems.

BACKGROUND: You're a seasoned PE investor with 15 years of experience in traditional industries (hospitality, real estate, retail). You understand business fundamentals but NOT sports-specific nuances. You're skeptical of "sports is different" claims unless backed by data. You ask tough, clarifying questions to test the consultant's expertise.

CONVERSATION STRUCTURE:
1. Opening (2 min): "Walk me through how sports revenue works. Why should I think about it differently than other businesses?"
2. Revenue Streams (4-6 min): "Talk me through 3 revenue streams. Where's the growth? Where are the limits?"
3. Investment Factors (3-4 min): "If you could only give me 2-3 factors to prioritize in my decision, what would they be and why?"
4. Challenges (2 min): "What am I not seeing? What concerns should I have about this investment?"
5. Closing (1 min): "Bottom line: Would you recommend I invest, and why?"

EVIDENCE OF STRONG PERFORMANCE (reward these):
- Clear explanation of sport's unique characteristics (ecosystem thinking, competitive balance, uncertainty of outcome)
- Specific revenue stream analysis with growth projections and risks
- Data-driven investment factors: "Media rights are 50% of revenue, but streaming disruption creates risk..."
- Application of case evidence: "The Canucks case shows how revenue sharing protects downside risk..."
- Executive communication: Concise, confident, uses analogies for complex concepts

PROVIDE CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK:
- If vague: "That's interesting, but can you be more specific? What's the data?"
- If jargon-heavy: "I'm not familiar with that term—can you explain it in plain language?"
- If missing evidence: "How do you know that? What's your source?"
- If strong: "That's a compelling point. Tell me more about [specific aspect]..."

After 10-15 minutes, provide rubric-aligned feedback:
- Clarity of revenue ecosystem explanation (How well did they explain sport's unique model?)
- Quality of revenue stream analysis (Did they identify growth potential and risks?)
- Strength of investment factors (Were their recommendations specific and defensible?)
- Executive communication (Were they concise, confident, and data-driven?)

Frame feedback as: "Here's what worked well... Here's where you can strengthen your written memo..."
```

**Rubric:**
| **Criterion** | **Feedback Focus** | **What to Look For** |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Revenue Ecosystem Explanation** | Clarity & Depth | Did they explain how sport revenue differs from traditional business? (interdependence, competitive balance, shared economics) |
| **Revenue Stream Analysis** | Specificity & Balance | Did they analyze 3 streams with growth potential AND risks? Used data/percentages? Showed trade-offs? |
| **Investment Factors** | Actionable & Defensible | Were their 2-3 factors specific (not vague)? Backed by evidence? Framed as prioritization for investment decision? |
| **Executive Communication** | Conciseness & Confidence | Were they concise (no rambling)? Used data to support claims? Handled challenges professionally? |

**Note:** This is formative feedback (not graded). Students should use AI insights to strengthen their written memo before submission.

---

## Step 3: Comparative Reflection (Due: [Date] by 11:59 PM)

Now that you have feedback from BOTH sources, critically compare them.

**Answer these questions in 150-200 words:**

### Question 1: Feedback Quality Comparison
- What did your peer reviewer notice that the AI missed?
- What did the AI notice that your peer missed?
- Were there areas where they disagreed? Which feedback seemed more accurate?

### Question 2: Strengths and Limitations
**Peer Feedback:**
- Strength: [What was most valuable about peer feedback?]
- Limitation: [What was missing or unclear?]

**AI Feedback:**
- Strength: [What was most valuable about AI feedback?]
- Limitation: [What was inaccurate or generic?]

### Question 3: Application Strategy
- Which feedback will you prioritize in your revision? Why?
- What criteria are you using to decide which suggestions to implement?
- How does this exercise change how you'll use AI in future writing tasks?

**Submit your reflection here:** [Link to submission box]

---

## Step 4: Revise Your Memo (Days 7-8)

Apply the insights from BOTH feedback sources:

**Revision Checklist:**
- [ ] Addressed peer feedback on revenue stream analysis
- [ ] Addressed AI feedback on business communication
- [ ] Evaluated competing suggestions and chose best approach
- [ ] Maintained executive memo format and tone
- [ ] Stayed within 500-word limit
- [ ] Cited course content appropriately

**Tip:** You are NOT required to implement ALL suggestions. Use your judgment to prioritize changes that most improve your argument.

---

## Step 5: Post-Revision Reflection (Submit with final memo)

After revising your memo, complete this brief reflection (100 words):

**Prompt:**
"Which feedback source (peer or AI) had the most influence on your revisions? Give 1-2 specific examples of changes you made based on each source. Did the comparative reflection process help you make better revision decisions than you would have with a single feedback source?"

**Format:** Include this reflection as an addendum to your final memo submission (does not count toward 500-word limit).

---

## Grading

**Final Memo:** 30 points (evaluated using original rubric criteria)

**PAIRR Participation Bonus:** Up to 5 bonus points
- Completed peer review form: 2 points
- Obtained AI feedback (verified by screenshot): 1 point
- Completed comparative reflection: 1 point

### Element 4: Details - Rubric Examples Content
```
Title: Rubric Details & Example Excerpts

[Expand to see evaluation criteria and examples]

## Revenue Stream Analysis (10 points)

**Excellent (9-10 pts):**
"Demonstrates sophisticated understanding of at least 3 revenue streams, explaining
not just what they are but how they interconnect. For example, shows how media
rights value depends on competitive talent, which requires revenue sharing to
maintain balance."

**Example Excerpt:**
"Media rights generate 55% of NHL revenue, but this value depends entirely on
competitive balance maintained through revenue sharing. Without sharing, wealthy
teams would monopolize talent, creating predictable outcomes that decrease media
value for all. The Canucks benefit from shared national media revenue ($XX million)
but must compete for scarce local sponsorship dollars..."

**Proficient (7-8 pts):**
"Accurately describes 3+ revenue streams with some analysis of characteristics.
May miss some interdependencies or deeper implications."

**Developing (5-6 pts):**
"Lists revenue streams but provides limited analysis. May treat streams as
independent rather than interconnected."

**Needs Improvement (0-4 pts):**
"Describes fewer than 3 streams, or descriptions are inaccurate or incomplete."

---

## Investment Factors (10 points)

**Excellent (9-10 pts):**
"Identifies 2-3 specific, defensible investment factors supported by evidence.
Factors show strategic thinking and business acumen."

**Example Excerpt:**
"Two factors would drive my investment decision: (1) Revenue sharing stability—
leagues with proven revenue sharing models (like the NFL) protect downside risk,
and (2) Emerging stream potential—teams with rights to betting partnerships and
digital content can capture high-growth revenue outside traditional sharing pools."

**Proficient (7-8 pts):**
"Identifies 2-3 reasonable factors with some justification. May lack specificity
or deep supporting evidence."

Title: ✦ Week 1 Key Takeaways

You've completed your introduction to sport revenue ecosystems! Here's what you
should take away:

- Revenue streams are interdependent, not independent
- Sport's business model is unique—competition on field, collaboration on economics
- Revenue sharing creates competitive balance but constrains entrepreneurial upside
- Growth opportunities exist at the frontier (betting, streaming, international)

This foundation prepares you for Week 2, where we'll dive deep into media rights
and fan engagement monetization—two of the highest-value and fastest-changing
revenue streams.

Well done!
```

### Element 2: Text Content - Group Marketing Project Connection
```
## Connecting to Your Group Marketing Project

As you begin thinking about your Group Marketing Project (60% of final grade),
consider how this week's content applies:

Your task will be to develop a comprehensive marketing plan for a sport organization.
Revenue strategy is the foundation of any marketing plan—you can't make strategic
marketing decisions without understanding revenue generation and constraints.

Questions to consider as you form your project team and select your organization:
• Which revenue streams offer the most growth potential for your chosen organization?
• How does revenue sharing (if applicable) constrain or enable marketing strategy?
• What emerging revenue streams (betting, NFTs, metaverse) could your organization leverage?
• How can marketing investments increase multiple revenue streams simultaneously?

We'll explore these questions throughout the course. By Week 5, you'll integrate
everything into a cohesive marketing strategy.

Start thinking about project teams and organization selection. More details in
the Project Guide (available on course homepage).
```

### Element 3: Text Content - Week 2 Preview
```
## Looking Ahead: Week 2 - Media, Content & Fan Engagement

Next week, we go deep on the largest and most dynamic revenue stream: media rights.

You'll explore:
• How media rights are valued and negotiated
• The shift from traditional broadcasting to streaming
• Fan engagement strategies and monetization
• Major deals analysis (e.g., Rogers/NHL $5.2 billion)

Executive Leader: [Name, Title]
Core Case: Rogers Communications and the NHL Rights Deal

**PLUS: Anchor Project Launch!** ◉
Week 2 marks the beginning of your course-long Anchor Project (60% of final grade).
You'll form teams of 5-6 students and select a sport property to analyze over the
remaining weeks. Start thinking about potential teammates and organizations that
interest you!

**Estimated Time Commitment:** Week 2 = 7-9 hours total (includes 2-3 hours for team
formation and property selection)

Get ready for another intensive week of learning! See you in Week 2.
