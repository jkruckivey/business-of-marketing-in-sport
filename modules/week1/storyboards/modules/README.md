## Navigation

**Start here**: [`week1-storyboard-overview.md`](../week1-storyboard-overview.md) (master file with links to all modules)

## Editing Workflow

1. Edit individual module files as needed
2. Each file is self-contained (no cross-references between modules)
3. Use Uplimit element conventions from Quick Start LEGEND
4. Maintain WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility standards
