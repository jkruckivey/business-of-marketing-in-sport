## Element 1: Bridge Video Scenario

**File:** `week1-bridge-scenario.mp4`
**Duration:** 2-3 minutes
**VTT File:** `week1-bridge-scenario.vtt` (required for accessibility)
**Format:** Direct-to-camera SME presentation
**Script:** SME introduces the Connor McDavid revenue paradox

### Video Script: "The $100 Million Question" (SME Direct-to-Camera)

**Recording Setup:** SME on camera, professional background, teleprompter optional

```
[0:00-0:20] INTRODUCTION & CREDIBILITY

SME: "Hi, I'm [NAME], and I've spent [X] years working in professional sport—
most recently as [ROLE] at [ORGANIZATION]. I've been on both sides of the table
for deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

And I want to start this course with a problem that's kept me up at night."

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "The $100 Million Question"]


[0:20-1:10] THE PARADOX SETUP

SME: "Imagine you're the GM of an NHL team. You just signed Connor McDavid—
the best player in hockey—to a $100 million, 8-year contract.

[VISUAL CUE: Show slide with contract breakdown]

That's $12.5 million per year. Your CFO tracks the immediate impacts:
• Ticket sales jump $5 million
• Jersey sales spike $3 million
• That's $8 million in new revenue

[Pause, lean forward]

Your board looks at these numbers and asks the obvious question:
'Why did we just LOSE $4.5 million per year on this deal?'

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "$12.5M cost - $8M revenue = -$4.5M loss?"]


[1:10-1:50] REFRAMING THE PROBLEM

SME: "Here's what I learned the hard way: If you're asking that question,
you're measuring the WRONG things.

Because Connor McDavid isn't worth $8 million to your organization.
He's worth $30 to $40 million per year.

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Actual Value: $30-40M/year"]

The problem isn't the numbers. The problem is understanding how sport revenue
works DIFFERENTLY than almost any other business.

There's a revenue ecosystem at play here—interdependencies that your CFO's
spreadsheet will never capture. Media deals that hinge on star power.
Sponsorships that activate around marquee players. Betting handles that spike
when the best player in the world takes the ice.


[1:50-2:30] LEARNING CHALLENGE & CALL-TO-ACTION

SME: "This week, you're going to learn how to see that ecosystem. You'll map
five major revenue streams in professional sport. You'll understand why they're
interdependent. And by the end, you'll be able to defend that $100 million
contract to a skeptical board—with numbers they can't argue with.

[Pause]

But first, I want to know: Do you ALREADY have the knowledge to solve this
problem? Can you explain where that missing $22-32 million comes from?

Right now, before you learn anything this week, test yourself. Take the
diagnostic exercise that follows this video. Be honest. Reveal your knowledge
gaps NOW—so we can fill them together.

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Next: Diagnostic Exercise + Pre-Assessment"]

Let's find out what you already know... and what you're about to discover."

## Element 2: AI Roleplay Scenario - The $100M Question

**Scenario Title:** "The $100 Million Question: Can You Solve It Now?"

**Purpose:** Diagnostic activity that reveals knowledge gaps and creates cognitive dissonance before content delivery. Students attempt to answer the executive's question from the video using their current understanding—most will struggle, which creates the "need to know" motivation for Week 1 content.

**When to Use:** Immediately after the bridge video (Element 1) while the narrative momentum is high.

**Assessment Type:** Diagnostic/Formative (not graded). Students are expected to struggle. The goal is to reveal what they DON'T know yet, making them hungry for the content that follows.

---

### Uplimit AI Roleplay Configuration

**Step 1: Select "AI Roleplay Scenario" element in Uplimit builder**

**Step 2: Set Learning Objective**

Choose: **"Add objective myself"** (to test specific skills and ensure learning goals are achieved)

Copy this into the **Objective** field:

```
Students will demonstrate their current understanding of sports revenue ecosystems by attempting to explain a complex business problem (Connor McDavid's $100M contract apparent loss) using their pre-existing knowledge. This diagnostic activity will reveal gaps in three key areas:

1. Revenue streams knowledge (can they identify all 5 major sources?)
2. Ecosystem thinking (do they understand interdependence vs. independence?)
3. Amplification effects (can they articulate indirect revenue impacts?)

Success = Student finishes knowing exactly what they DON'T know yet, with motivation to learn Week 1 content.
```

---

**Step 3: Create Scenario**

Choose: **"Create your own scenario"**

Copy this into the **Scenario Context** field:

```
You are a junior analyst at an NHL franchise. You just watched your executive present a business problem to the board: The team signed Connor McDavid to a $12.5 million per year contract. Direct revenue increases (tickets $5M + jerseys $3M = $8M) fall short of the cost by $4.5 million annually. The board is questioning the investment.

Your executive has turned to you after the presentation and asked: "Can you explain to the board why this deal makes financial sense despite the apparent loss?"

You know you're new to sports business, so the executive is patient—but they need a clear, business-focused explanation.

Your goal: Attempt to answer using your current knowledge. It's okay to struggle! This is diagnostic—you're discovering what you need to learn this week.

Conversation length: 3-4 exchanges with the AI executive
```

Copy this into the **AI Role** field:

```
You are a senior executive at an NHL franchise. The team recently signed Connor McDavid to a $12.5 million per year contract. Direct revenue increases (tickets $5M + jerseys $3M = $8M) fall short of the cost by $4.5 million annually. The board is questioning the investment, and you've asked a junior analyst to explain why this deal makes financial sense.

Your personality:
- Patient but probing: You know they're new, so you don't expect perfection—but you do want to understand their thinking
- Business-focused: You care about clear explanations backed by reasoning, not jargon
- Socratic: When they struggle, you ask questions that help them discover gaps rather than lecturing
- Realistic: You acknowledge that sports economics is complex and counterintuitive

Your conversation strategy:

Wait for the student to start the conversation. They've been asked to explain why the Connor McDavid contract makes financial sense. Listen to their opening explanation, then respond with probing questions based on what they say:

1. If they mention only direct revenue (tickets/jerseys), ask: "What other ways do you think Connor McDavid might generate revenue for us?"

2. If they struggle to identify streams, ask: "Think about how fans engage with the team. Beyond coming to games and buying jerseys, how else do we make money?"

3. If they list streams but treat them as separate, ask: "Interesting. Do you think those revenue sources are independent of each other, or could they be connected somehow?"

4. Closing (after 3-4 exchanges): Acknowledge their effort and gaps: "You've identified some pieces, but I can tell you're missing the full picture—and that's completely normal before learning the revenue ecosystem framework. This week's content will give you the tools to answer this question confidently."

Exit gracefully after 3-4 exchanges even if they're still struggling—the goal is diagnosis, not mastery.
```

Copy this into the **Student Role** field:

```
You are a junior analyst at an NHL franchise who must explain to the executive why the Connor McDavid contract creates value beyond the apparent $4.5M annual loss. Start the conversation by sharing your current thinking. This is diagnostic—struggle is expected and valuable.
```

**Note:** Keep this field minimal since it displays to students without formatting. The detailed instructions will appear in the "Student Instructions" section (Step 5) with proper markdown formatting.

---

**Step 4: Hidden Context (AI-only information)**

Copy this into the **Hidden Context** field:

```
**AI Character Context:**
You are a senior NHL executive conducting a diagnostic conversation. The student is encountering sports revenue economics for the first time. Most will struggle—this is intentional and pedagogically valuable.

**What Students Typically Miss (use to guide probing):**
- Media rights amplification (star players increase broadcast value by $20-30M annually)
- Sponsorship activation (brands pay premium to associate with elite talent)
- Betting handle increases (McDavid games drive 15-20% higher betting volume)
- Merchandise ecosystem effects (jerseys are just 10% of total merch impact)
- Long-term competitive effects (stars attract free agents, sustain playoff revenue)

**Conversation Objectives (3-4 exchanges):**
1. **Opening:** Let student explain their initial thinking without interruption
2. **Probe #1:** If they mention only direct revenue, ask what other revenue streams exist
3. **Probe #2:** If they list streams independently, ask about interconnections
4. **Closing:** Acknowledge effort, name specific gaps (e.g., "You identified ticketing but missed how media rights amplify star value"), and encourage them that Week 1 will fill these gaps

**Success Indicators:**
- ✅ Student attempts answer (even if incomplete)
- ✅ Student recognizes their knowledge gaps
- ✅ Student feels motivated to learn, not defeated

**After 3-4 exchanges:** Provide rubric-aligned feedback using the 3 criteria defined in the rubric.
```

---

**Step 5: Configure Feedback Rubric**

Uplimit will auto-generate a rubric based on your scenario. Click **"Auto-regenerate"** if needed, then customize:

**Add/Edit these criteria:**

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Revenue Streams Knowledge** | Can the student identify multiple revenue sources beyond tickets and jerseys? (Looking for: media rights, sponsorship, merchandising, betting/gaming) |
| **Ecosystem Thinking** | Does the student recognize that revenue streams are interdependent rather than independent? (Looking for: causal connections between streams, not just lists) |
| **Amplification Effects** | Can the student articulate how a star player amplifies multiple revenue streams simultaneously? (Looking for: indirect effects, not just direct ticket/jersey sales) |

**Feedback Approach:** Diagnostic only (not graded)

Check the box: **"Provide feedback but do not grade"**

**Step 6: Student Instructions**

Copy this into the **Instructions for Students** field:

```markdown
### Your Role
You are a **junior analyst** who just watched your executive present the Connor McDavid contract dilemma. The executive has turned to you and asked: "Can you explain this to the board?"

### Getting Started
**You need to start the conversation.** When the chat opens, begin by explaining why you think the Connor McDavid contract might make financial sense despite the apparent $4.5M annual loss. The executive is waiting for your opening explanation.

### The Scenario
The executive from the video is waiting for your answer. They know you're new to sports business, so they're patient—but they need a clear explanation of why the $12.5M cost minus $8M in direct revenue doesn't tell the whole story.

### What to Have Ready
- **Your current understanding** of how sports revenue works (it's okay if this is limited!)
- **Your best attempt** at explaining why the McDavid contract might create value beyond ticket and jersey sales
- **Curiosity** about what you DON'T know yet

### Your Goal
⚠️ **This is diagnostic—you're not expected to ace this!** Most students struggle before learning the Week 1 content. The goal is to:

1. Start the conversation with your best attempt at explaining the contract's value
2. Respond to the executive's probing questions using your current knowledge
3. Discover gaps in your understanding (this is GOOD—it shows you what to focus on)
4. Get motivated to learn the revenue ecosystem concepts that would help you answer confidently

### Conversation Length
- **3-4 exchanges** with the executive
- The AI will probe your understanding with 2-3 follow-up questions after your opening explanation
- If you get stuck, that's the point! Notice where you struggle—those are your learning priorities.

### What Happens Next
After this exercise, you'll take a pre-assessment quiz that helps you identify exactly what you need to learn. By the end of Week 1, you'll return to this question and answer it confidently using the revenue ecosystem framework.

## Element 3: Infobox - The Revenue Problem

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Infobox** element in module builder
2. Choose variant: **Callout** (use Uplimit's actual variant name - typically "Callout", "Note", "Warning", or "Insight")
3. Copy the markdown below into the infobox content field

```markdown
Title: The Revenue Problem Professional Sport Faces

Professional sports teams operate with a business model that defies conventional logic: competitors must collaborate financially, revenue sources are deeply interdependent, and investments in one area create unpredictable ripple effects across the ecosystem. This week you'll explore why teams "overpay" for star players, how leagues balance entrepreneurial success with competitive fairness, which revenue streams are growing versus hitting capacity limits, and why some leagues share revenue while others don't. By the end, you'll solve these problems using real NHL data—but first, let's see what you already know.
```

**Note:** If "Callout" variant isn't available in your Uplimit instance, use the closest equivalent (typically the first option in the variant dropdown). Uplimit's standard variants are: Callout, Note, Insight, Warning, or custom institutional variants.

### QUIZ CONTENT REFERENCE (10 Questions)

The widget includes these questions (full content embedded in HTML file):

---

**QUESTION 1** (MLO 1.1 - Revenue Streams Knowledge)

**Question:** Which revenue stream accounts for the largest percentage of total revenue for most major professional leagues?

**Type:** Multiple Choice (single answer)

**Answer Options:**
- A) Ticketing (20-30%)
- B) Media rights (40-60%) ✅ **CORRECT**
- C) Sponsorship (15-25%)
- D) Merchandising (5-10%)

**Correct Answer:** B

**Feedback for Correct Answer:**
Correct! Media rights are the largest revenue stream for most major leagues (NFL, NBA, NHL, Premier League), typically accounting for 40-60% of total revenue. The NFL's latest TV deals total $110 billion over 11 years, demonstrating media's dominance.

**Feedback for Incorrect Answers:**
Not quite. While [selected answer] is important, media rights actually account for the largest share (40-60%) of total revenue in most major leagues. The NFL's $110 billion TV deals demonstrate media's dominance over other streams.

---

**QUESTION 2** (MLO 1.1 - Revenue Streams Knowledge)

**Question:** Rank these revenue streams by annual growth rate over the past 5 years (fastest to slowest):

**Type:** Ordering/Ranking

**Items to Rank:**
1. Betting/Gaming
2. Media Rights
3. Sponsorship
4. Ticketing
5. Merchandising

**Correct Order:**
1. Betting/Gaming (30-40% annual growth) ✅
2. Media Rights (8-12% annual growth) ✅
3. Sponsorship (5-8% annual growth) ✅
4. Merchandising (3-5% annual growth) ✅
5. Ticketing (1-3% annual growth - capacity constrained) ✅

**Feedback:**
Correct ranking! Betting/gaming is the fastest-growing stream due to legalization waves (30-40% annually), followed by media rights driven by streaming competition (8-12%). Sponsorship grows steadily (5-8%), while merchandising (3-5%) and ticketing (1-3%) face capacity constraints. Ticketing can't grow infinitely—there are only so many seats!

---

**QUESTION 3** (MLO 1.2 - Sport's Unique Business Model)

**Question:** In 2-3 sentences, explain why professional sports teams share revenue with competitors.

**Type:** Short Answer (text box, 100-150 words)

**Sample Strong Answer:**
"Professional sports teams share revenue to maintain competitive balance, which preserves the uncertainty of outcome that makes games compelling. If large-market teams (Toronto, New York) always dominate due to financial advantages, fans in small markets (Winnipeg, Carolina) lose interest, hurting the entire league's product. Revenue sharing ensures all teams can compete, protecting the league-wide brand and maximizing total revenue for everyone."

**Grading Rubric (for AI or manual grading):**
- ✅ **Strong (8-10 pts):** Mentions competitive balance AND uncertainty of outcome AND league-wide benefit
- ◐ **Adequate (5-7 pts):** Mentions competitive balance but may miss connection to uncertainty or league benefit
- ○ **Weak (0-4 pts):** Vague answer about "fairness" without explaining economic rationale

**Feedback for Strong Answer:**
Excellent! You've identified the core economic logic: competitive balance preserves uncertainty of outcome, which is the product that leagues sell. Revenue sharing is an investment in the league-wide brand, not charity.

**Feedback for Weak Answer:**
You're on the right track, but dig deeper. Think about why competitive balance matters economically. What happens to fan interest if the same 3 teams always win? How does that affect the entire league's revenue?

---

**QUESTION 4** (MLO 1.2 - Sport's Unique Business Model)

**Question:** True or False: Betting legalization creates only one new revenue stream for leagues (betting partnerships).

**Type:** True/False with explanation

**Correct Answer:** False ✅

**Explanation (shown after answer):**
False! Betting legalization creates MULTIPLE revenue streams and amplifies existing ones:
1. **Direct betting partnerships** ($100M+ annually for major leagues)
2. **Increased media rights value** (betting drives live viewership, making broadcasts more valuable)
3. **Higher sponsorship rates** (betting companies pay premium to advertise during games)
4. **Enhanced fan engagement** (betting keeps fans watching until final whistle, increasing ad impressions)
5. **Data licensing fees** (leagues sell real-time data to betting operators)

This is ecosystem thinking—one change ripples across multiple revenue streams.

**Feedback for Correct Answer:**
Correct! Betting legalization is a perfect example of revenue ecosystem effects. One regulatory change creates new direct revenue (partnerships) while amplifying existing streams (media, sponsorship, engagement). This interconnection is central to sports revenue strategy.

**Feedback for Incorrect Answer:**
Not quite! Betting legalization does more than create partnerships. It increases media rights value (betting drives live viewership), sponsorship rates (betting companies advertise), fan engagement (betting keeps fans watching), and data licensing fees. One change affects the entire ecosystem—that's the key insight!

---

**QUESTION 5** (MLO 1.3 - Growth Potential vs. Risk)

**Question:** The Edmonton Oilers sign Connor McDavid for $12.5M/year. Direct revenue increase: Tickets +$5M, Jerseys +$3M = $8M total. Is this a good investment? Why or why not?

**Type:** Multiple Choice with rationale

**Answer Options:**
- A) No - the team loses $4.5M annually ($12.5M cost - $8M revenue)
- B) Yes - but only if they win the Stanley Cup and increase playoff revenue
- C) Yes - McDavid generates $20-30M in indirect revenue (media rights, sponsorship, betting) beyond direct ticket/jersey sales ✅ **CORRECT**
- D) No - star players are overvalued and teams should invest in depth players instead

**Correct Answer:** C

**Feedback for Correct Answer:**
Correct! This is the $100M question from the bridge scenario. McDavid generates massive indirect revenue: media rights increase $20-30M annually (broadcasters pay more for star power), sponsorships pay premiums to associate with elite talent, betting handle spikes when he plays, and merchandise has ecosystem effects beyond jerseys. Direct revenue ($8M) is just the tip of the iceberg. Total value: $30-40M annually.

**Feedback for Incorrect Answers:**
Think bigger! Direct revenue (tickets $5M + jerseys $3M = $8M) misses the ecosystem effects. McDavid increases media rights value by $20-30M annually (broadcasters pay more for stars), sponsorships pay premiums, betting handle spikes, and merchandise has ripple effects. Total ecosystem value: $30-40M annually. This is why teams "overpay" for elite talent—they're not actually overpaying when you see the full picture.

---

**QUESTION 6** (MLO 1.3 - Growth Potential vs. Risk)

**Question:** You have $50M to invest in ONE revenue stream with highest 5-year growth potential. Rank these options by expected return:

**Type:** Multiple Choice (single answer)

**Scenario Context:**
Your league just legalized betting partnerships, streaming services are bidding aggressively for rights, and your stadium is 15 years old with 18,000 capacity.

**Answer Options:**
- A) Build new stadium ($50M) to increase capacity to 22,000 seats
- B) Lock in 10-year media rights deal with traditional broadcaster ($50M guaranteed)
- C) Launch betting partnerships and data licensing ($5M investment, revenue share model) ✅ **CORRECT**
- D) Spend on sponsorship sales team and activation ($10M over 5 years)

**Correct Answer:** C

**Feedback for Correct Answer:**
Correct! Betting partnerships offer 30-40% annual growth with minimal upfront investment ($5M). Your $50M investment would generate $200M+ over 5 years through revenue share models. Stadium capacity is limited (you can't build infinitely), traditional media deals lock you into declining platforms, and sponsorship requires ongoing investment. Betting is high-growth, low-capex, and riding regulatory tailwinds. Risk: regulation could reverse, but growth potential is highest.

**Feedback for Incorrect Answers:**
Think about growth rates and constraints. Stadiums are capacity-limited (can't grow infinitely), traditional broadcasters are declining (cord-cutting), and sponsorship grows slowly (5-8%). Betting partnerships offer 30-40% annual growth with minimal upfront investment. Regulatory risk exists, but growth potential far exceeds other options. High risk, high reward—classic growth investment.

---

**QUESTION 7** (MLO 1.4 - Revenue Sharing Models)

**Question:** Can you explain one advantage AND one disadvantage of revenue sharing for a mid-market team like the Vancouver Canucks?

**Type:** Short Answer (text box, 100-150 words)

**Sample Strong Answer:**
"Advantage: The Canucks benefit from equal sharing of national media rights (50% of NHL national TV deals). Even though Vancouver is a smaller market than Toronto or New York, they receive the same share of lucrative U.S. broadcast contracts, which provides financial stability.

Disadvantage: Revenue sharing limits the Canucks' ability to capitalize on their local strengths. Vancouver has strong corporate support and passionate fans willing to pay premium prices, but the team must contribute some local revenue to the league pool. This constrains their competitive advantage—entrepreneurial success is taxed to support smaller markets, reducing the Canucks' financial upside."

**Grading Rubric:**
- ✅ **Strong (8-10 pts):** Identifies specific advantage (national media sharing) AND specific disadvantage (limits local revenue potential), uses Canucks-specific context
- ◐ **Adequate (5-7 pts):** Identifies generic advantage/disadvantage but may lack Canucks-specific application
- ○ **Weak (0-4 pts):** Only provides one side (advantage OR disadvantage) or gives vague answers

**Feedback for Strong Answer:**
Excellent analysis! You've identified the core tension: revenue sharing provides stability (national media benefits) but constrains entrepreneurial upside (local revenue taxation). Mid-market teams like Vancouver face this trade-off constantly—they're not big enough to dominate without sharing, but not small enough to be pure recipients. This complexity makes revenue sharing strategy fascinating.

**Feedback for Weak Answer:**
You're on the right track, but be more specific. Think about which revenue streams are shared (national media, licensing) versus local (tickets, sponsorship). How does this affect a mid-market team like Vancouver specifically? What do they gain from sharing? What do they lose?

---

**QUESTION 8** (MLO 1.1 - Revenue Streams Knowledge)

**Question:** Match each revenue stream to its primary growth constraint:

**Type:** Matching

**Revenue Streams (Left Column):**
1. Ticketing
2. Media Rights
3. Sponsorship
4. Merchandising
5. Betting/Gaming

**Constraints (Right Column):**
A. Regulatory uncertainty (legalization varies by jurisdiction)
B. Physical capacity limits (can't build infinite seats)
C. Brand saturation (too many sponsors dilute value)
D. Consumer discretionary spending (economic downturns hurt sales)
E. Fragmentation of viewing audiences (cord-cutting, streaming competition)

**Correct Matches:**
1. Ticketing → B (Physical capacity limits) ✅
2. Media Rights → E (Fragmentation of viewing audiences) ✅
3. Sponsorship → C (Brand saturation) ✅
4. Merchandising → D (Consumer discretionary spending) ✅
5. Betting/Gaming → A (Regulatory uncertainty) ✅

**Feedback:**
Correct matches! Understanding these constraints is crucial for strategy:
- **Ticketing** can't grow infinitely (stadiums have fixed capacity)
- **Media Rights** face fragmentation (cord-cutting, streaming wars reduce per-viewer value)
- **Sponsorship** risks saturation (every surface can't be branded without diminishing value)
- **Merchandising** suffers in recessions (jerseys are discretionary spending)
- **Betting** faces regulatory risk (legalization can reverse, creating volatility)

Strategic insight: Diversify across streams with different constraint types to build resilient portfolios.

**Note:** Full quiz content, feedback, and scoring logic are embedded in `revenue-strategy-pre-assessment.html` widget.

**REFERENCE ONLY - QUESTION 9** (MLO 1.3 - Growth Potential vs. Risk)

**Question:** A team invests $300M in a new stadium. Which revenue streams will this investment directly impact? (Select all that apply)

**Type:** Multiple Select (check all that apply)

**Answer Options:**
- ☑ A) Ticketing (premium seating, suites, increased capacity) ✅ **CORRECT**
- ☑ B) Sponsorship (naming rights, in-stadium signage, activation spaces) ✅ **CORRECT**
- ☑ C) Concessions and parking (game-day revenue) ✅ **CORRECT**
- ☐ D) Media rights (broadcasting deals are independent of stadium quality)
- ☐ E) Merchandising (jersey sales happen online and in stores, not just stadiums)

**Correct Answers:** A, B, C

**Feedback for Fully Correct (selected A, B, C only):**
Correct! Stadium investments directly impact ticketing (premium seating, suites, capacity), sponsorship (naming rights, signage, activation), and concessions/parking (game-day revenue). Media rights are negotiated at the league level and don't change based on individual stadium quality. Merchandising happens primarily online and in retail stores, not stadiums. However, there ARE indirect effects: better stadiums improve fan experience, which can boost merchandise sales and make broadcasts more appealing (ecosystem thinking!).

**Feedback for Partial Credit (selected A, B, C plus D or E):**
You're mostly right! Stadium investments DO directly impact ticketing, sponsorship, and concessions. Media rights are negotiated league-wide and don't directly depend on stadium quality, and merchandising happens mostly online/retail. However, you're thinking about indirect effects—better stadiums CAN improve broadcasts and fan engagement. That's ecosystem thinking! For this question, we're focusing on direct impacts only.

**Feedback for Incorrect (missing A, B, or C):**
Not quite! Think about what happens inside the stadium on game day. New stadiums allow teams to charge more for premium seating (ticketing), sell naming rights and signage (sponsorship), and increase food/parking revenue (concessions). Media rights are negotiated at the league level, and most merchandising happens online or in stores, not at the venue.

**QUESTION 10** (MLO 1.4 - Revenue Sharing Models)

**Question:** The NHL shares 50% of national media revenue equally among all 32 teams. The Toronto Maple Leafs generate $200M in local revenue, while the Arizona Coyotes generate $60M locally. Under this system, which statement is TRUE?

**Type:** Multiple Choice (single answer)

**Answer Options:**
- A) Toronto and Arizona receive equal total revenue (local + shared)
- B) Toronto receives more total revenue but pays into a pool that redistributes to Arizona ✅ **CORRECT**
- C) Arizona receives more total revenue because they get larger revenue sharing payments
- D) Revenue sharing eliminates all financial differences between large and small market teams

**Correct Answer:** B

**Feedback for Correct Answer:**
Correct! Toronto generates $200M locally + receives equal national media share, while Arizona generates $60M locally + receives equal national media share. Toronto's total revenue is higher ($200M local >> $60M local), but revenue sharing reduces the gap. Toronto is likely a net contributor (pays into the league pool), while Arizona is a net recipient (receives from the pool). Revenue sharing REDUCES inequality but doesn't eliminate it—Toronto still has a financial advantage, just not as large as it would be without sharing.

**Feedback for Incorrect Answers:**
Think about the math: Toronto's $200M local revenue far exceeds Arizona's $60M, so even with equal national media sharing, Toronto's total revenue is higher. Revenue sharing REDUCES the gap (Toronto might pay $20M into a pool that Arizona receives from), but doesn't eliminate it entirely. The goal is competitive balance, not perfect equality. Toronto still has financial advantages—just smaller ones than they would without revenue sharing.

## Element 5: Infobox - Results Interpretation & Learning Path

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Infobox** element in module builder
2. Choose variant: **Insight** (or closest equivalent - typically used for reflective/guidance content)
3. Copy the markdown below into the infobox content field

```markdown
Title: What Your Pre-Assessment Results Mean

Your quiz results create a personalized learning path for this week. Lower scores (0-6/10) suggest spending extra time with Module 3's core content and all interactive widgets—you're starting fresh, which is perfect for building strong fundamentals. Higher scores (7-10/10) indicate solid baseline knowledge, so challenge yourself with the Canucks case analysis and Revenue Empire Builder strategic simulation. Remember: this quiz isn't graded, it's a diagnostic tool to help you learn efficiently. Now that you know where you stand, let's solve those revenue problems.
```

**Note:** If "Insight" variant isn't available, use the variant typically used for reflective content or guidance boxes in your Uplimit instance.

## Module Summary

**What You've Accomplished:**
You've been hooked by a real business problem—the Connor McDavid $100M paradox—and you've taken your first steps toward solving it. Through the diagnostic conversation and pre-assessment quiz, you've discovered exactly where your knowledge gaps are. That's not a weakness—it's a strategic advantage. You now know precisely what you need to learn this week.

**Key Insight:**
The fact that you struggled with the diagnostic exercise is actually the point. Professional sports revenue works differently than almost any other business. The traditional MBA frameworks don't fully apply here. Revenue streams are interdependent, not independent. Investments create ripple effects across the entire ecosystem. And what looks like a $4.5M loss on a spreadsheet might actually be a $32M gain when you understand the full picture.

**Up Next: Module 1 - Learning Outcomes**
Now that you've seen the problem and identified your knowledge gaps, Module 1 will show you exactly what you're going to learn this week. You'll see the four key challenges you'll be able to solve by Friday—challenges that will transform you from someone who sees the McDavid contract as a loss into someone who can confidently defend it to a skeptical board with data they can't argue with.

Ready to turn those knowledge gaps into strategic capabilities? Let's define your learning path.

## 🎯 FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION

**How Module 0 Supports Your Final Strategic Vision:**

Module 0 introduced you to the fundamental challenge of sports business strategy: revenue streams are interdependent ecosystems, not independent channels. This systems thinking is the foundation for your Week 5 capstone deliverable.

**What You Discovered:**
- Professional sports revenue works differently than traditional business models
- Investments in one stream (Connor McDavid's $100M contract) create ripple effects across the entire ecosystem ($132M total value)
- What looks like a loss on one line item can be a strategic gain when ecosystem effects are considered

**How to Apply This to Your Final Project:**

When you create your 5-year strategic vision in Week 5, you'll need to demonstrate this ecosystem thinking throughout your analysis. Module 0 taught you to never evaluate a single decision (hiring an athlete, signing a media deal, pricing tickets) in isolation—always trace the cascade effects:

- **Revenue Model Section:** Explain how your property's revenue streams reinforce each other (ticket sales → fan data → sponsorship value → media rights premiums)
- **Investment Decisions:** Justify seemingly expensive investments by quantifying ecosystem effects across all 5 revenue streams
- **Risk Analysis:** Identify how problems in one revenue stream cascade through the ecosystem (e.g., declining attendance → reduced sponsorship appeal → lower media rights value)

**Real-World Application:** The McDavid paradox you analyzed today is the same challenge you'll face in Week 5: How do you convince stakeholders that strategic investments create value beyond their immediate cost? Module 0 taught you the answer: map the ecosystem effects.
