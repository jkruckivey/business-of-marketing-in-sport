## Element 1: Bridge Video Scenario

**File:** `week1-bridge-scenario.mp4`
**Duration:** 2-3 minutes
**VTT File:** `week1-bridge-scenario.vtt` (required for accessibility)
**Format:** Direct-to-camera SME presentation
**Script:** SME introduces the Connor McDavid revenue paradox

### Video Script: "The $100 Million Question" (SME Direct-to-Camera)

**Recording Setup:** SME on camera, professional background, teleprompter optional

```
[0:00-0:20] INTRODUCTION & CREDIBILITY

SME: "Hi, I'm [NAME], and I've spent [X] years working in professional sport—
most recently as [ROLE] at [ORGANIZATION]. I've been on both sides of the table
for deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

And I want to start this course with a problem that's kept me up at night."

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "The $100 Million Question"]


[0:20-1:10] THE PARADOX SETUP

SME: "Imagine you're the GM of an NHL team. You just signed Connor McDavid—
the best player in hockey—to a $100 million, 8-year contract.

[VISUAL CUE: Show slide with contract breakdown]

That's $12.5 million per year. Your CFO tracks the immediate impacts:
• Ticket sales jump $5 million
• Jersey sales spike $3 million
• That's $8 million in new revenue

[Pause, lean forward]

Your board looks at these numbers and asks the obvious question:
'Why did we just LOSE $4.5 million per year on this deal?'

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "$12.5M cost - $8M revenue = -$4.5M loss?"]


[1:10-1:50] REFRAMING THE PROBLEM

SME: "Here's what I learned the hard way: If you're asking that question,
you're measuring the WRONG things.

Because Connor McDavid isn't worth $8 million to your organization.
He's worth $30 to $40 million per year.

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Actual Value: $30-40M/year"]

The problem isn't the numbers. The problem is understanding how sport revenue
works DIFFERENTLY than almost any other business.

There's a revenue ecosystem at play here—interdependencies that your CFO's
spreadsheet will never capture. Media deals that hinge on star power.
Sponsorships that activate around marquee players. Betting handles that spike
when the best player in the world takes the ice.


[1:50-2:30] LEARNING CHALLENGE & CALL-TO-ACTION

SME: "This week, you're going to learn how to see that ecosystem. You'll map
five major revenue streams in professional sport. You'll understand why they're
interdependent. And by the end, you'll be able to defend that $100 million
contract to a skeptical board—with numbers they can't argue with.

[Pause]

But first, I want to know: Do you ALREADY have the knowledge to solve this
problem? Can you explain where that missing $22-32 million comes from?

Right now, before you learn anything this week, test yourself. Take the
diagnostic exercise that follows this video. Be honest. Reveal your knowledge
gaps NOW—so we can fill them together.

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Next: Diagnostic Exercise + Pre-Assessment"]

Let's find out what you already know... and what you're about to discover."

[END: 2:30]

## Element 2: AI Roleplay Scenario - The $100M Question

**Scenario Title:** "The $100 Million Question: Can You Solve It Now?"

**Purpose:** Diagnostic activity that reveals knowledge gaps and creates cognitive dissonance before content delivery. Students attempt to answer the executive's question from the video using their current understanding—most will struggle, which creates the "need to know" motivation for Week 1 content.

**When to Use:** Immediately after the bridge video (Element 1) while the narrative momentum is high.

**Assessment Type:** Diagnostic/Formative (not graded). Students are expected to struggle. The goal is to reveal what they DON'T know yet, making them hungry for the content that follows.

---

### Uplimit AI Roleplay Configuration

**Step 1: Select "AI Roleplay Scenario" element in Uplimit builder**

**Step 2: Set Learning Objective**

Choose: **"Add objective myself"** (to test specific skills and ensure learning goals are achieved)

Copy this into the **Objective** field:

```
Students will demonstrate their current understanding of sports revenue ecosystems by attempting to explain a complex business problem (Connor McDavid's $100M contract apparent loss) using their pre-existing knowledge. This diagnostic activity will reveal gaps in three key areas:

1. Revenue streams knowledge (can they identify all 5 major sources?)
2. Ecosystem thinking (do they understand interdependence vs. independence?)
3. Amplification effects (can they articulate indirect revenue impacts?)

Success = Student finishes knowing exactly what they DON'T know yet, with motivation to learn Week 1 content.
```

---

**Step 3: Create Scenario**

Choose: **"Create your own scenario"**

Copy this into the **Scenario Context** field:

```
You are a junior analyst at an NHL franchise. You just watched your executive present a business problem to the board: The team signed Connor McDavid to a $12.5 million per year contract. Direct revenue increases (tickets $5M + jerseys $3M = $8M) fall short of the cost by $4.5 million annually. The board is questioning the investment.

Your executive has turned to you after the presentation and asked: "Can you explain to the board why this deal makes financial sense despite the apparent loss?"

You know you're new to sports business, so the executive is patient—but they need a clear, business-focused explanation.

Your goal: Attempt to answer using your current knowledge. It's okay to struggle! This is diagnostic—you're discovering what you need to learn this week.

Time limit: 5-7 minutes of conversation (3-4 exchanges with the AI executive)
```

Copy this into the **AI Role** field:

```
You are the same executive from the bridge video—a senior leader at an NHL franchise who just presented the Connor McDavid contract dilemma to the board. You're now talking to a junior analyst who's new to sports business.

Your personality:
- Patient but probing: You know they're new, so you don't expect perfection—but you do want to understand their thinking
- Business-focused: You care about clear explanations backed by reasoning, not jargon
- Socratic: When they struggle, you ask questions that help them discover gaps rather than lecturing
- Realistic: You acknowledge that sports economics is complex and counterintuitive

Your conversation strategy:

1. Opening: "Alright, you heard the problem. Walk me through your thinking—why might this contract make sense despite the apparent $4.5M annual loss?"

2. Probe #1: Listen to their answer. If they mention only direct revenue (tickets/jerseys), ask: "What other ways do you think Connor McDavid might generate revenue for us?"

3. Probe #2: If they struggle to identify streams, ask: "Think about how fans engage with the team. Beyond coming to games and buying jerseys, how else do we make money?"

4. Probe #3: If they list streams but treat them as separate, ask: "Interesting. Do you think those revenue sources are independent of each other, or could they be connected somehow?"

5. Closing (after 3-4 exchanges): Acknowledge their effort and gaps: "You've identified some pieces, but I can tell you're missing the full picture—and that's completely normal before learning the revenue ecosystem framework. This week's content will give you the tools to answer this question confidently."

Keep the conversation to 5-7 minutes maximum. Exit gracefully even if they're still struggling—the goal is diagnosis, not mastery.
```

Copy this into the **Student Role** field:

```
You are a junior analyst who is new to sports business. The executive from the video is waiting for your answer. You should:

1. Attempt to explain why the Connor McDavid contract might create value beyond the $8M in direct revenue (tickets + jerseys)
2. Use your current understanding of business and revenue (it's okay if it's limited!)
3. Be honest when you don't know something
4. Notice where you struggle—those are your learning priorities for Week 1

Remember: This is diagnostic, not evaluative. Most students struggle before learning the content. That's the point!
```

---

**Step 4: Configure Feedback Rubric**

Uplimit will auto-generate a rubric based on your scenario. Click **"Auto-regenerate"** if needed, then customize:

**Add/Edit these criteria:**

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Revenue Streams Knowledge** | Can the student identify multiple revenue sources beyond tickets and jerseys? (Looking for: media rights, sponsorship, merchandising, betting/gaming) |
| **Ecosystem Thinking** | Does the student recognize that revenue streams are interdependent rather than independent? (Looking for: causal connections between streams, not just lists) |
| **Amplification Effects** | Can the student articulate how a star player amplifies multiple revenue streams simultaneously? (Looking for: indirect effects, not just direct ticket/jersey sales) |

**Feedback Approach:** Diagnostic only (not graded)

Check the box: **"Provide feedback but do not grade"**

**Step 5: Student Instructions**

Copy this into the **Instructions for Students** field:

```markdown
### Your Role
You are a **junior analyst** who just watched your executive present the Connor McDavid contract dilemma. The executive has turned to you and asked: "Can you explain this to the board?"

### The Scenario
The executive from the video is waiting for your answer. They know you're new to sports business, so they're patient—but they need a clear explanation of why the $12.5M cost minus $8M in direct revenue doesn't tell the whole story.

### What to Have Ready
- **Your current understanding** of how sports revenue works (it's okay if this is limited!)
- **Your best attempt** at explaining why the McDavid contract might create value beyond ticket and jersey sales
- **Curiosity** about what you DON'T know yet

### Your Goal
⚠️ **This is diagnostic—you're not expected to ace this!** Most students struggle before learning the Week 1 content. The goal is to:

1. Attempt to answer the executive's question using your current knowledge
2. Discover gaps in your understanding (this is GOOD—it shows you what to focus on)
3. Get motivated to learn the revenue ecosystem concepts that would help you answer confidently

### Time Limit
- **5-7 minutes** for the conversation
- The AI will probe your understanding with 3-4 follow-up questions
- If you get stuck, that's the point! Notice where you struggle—those are your learning priorities.

### What Happens Next
After this exercise, you'll take a pre-assessment quiz that helps you identify exactly what you need to learn. By the end of Week 1, you'll return to this question and answer it confidently using the revenue ecosystem framework.

## Element 3: Infobox - The Revenue Problem

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Infobox** element in module builder
2. Choose variant: **Callout** (use Uplimit's actual variant name - typically "Callout", "Note", "Warning", or "Insight")
3. Copy the markdown below into the infobox content field

```markdown
Title: The Revenue Problem Professional Sport Faces

Professional sports teams operate with a business model that defies conventional logic: competitors must collaborate financially, revenue sources are deeply interdependent, and investments in one area create unpredictable ripple effects across the ecosystem. This week you'll explore why teams "overpay" for star players, how leagues balance entrepreneurial success with competitive fairness, which revenue streams are growing versus hitting capacity limits, and why some leagues share revenue while others don't. By the end, you'll solve these problems using real NHL data—but first, let's see what you already know.
```

**Note:** If "Callout" variant isn't available in your Uplimit instance, use the closest equivalent (typically the first option in the variant dropdown). Uplimit's standard variants are: Callout, Note, Insight, Warning, or custom institutional variants.

## Element 4: Text - Outcomes as "Can You..." Questions

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Text** element in module builder
2. Copy the markdown below directly into the text field

```markdown
# Can You Solve These Revenue Problems?

Professional sport presents unique business challenges that traditional MBA frameworks don't fully address. This week tests whether you can apply strategic thinking to an industry where the rules are different.

## **Challenge 1: Map the Revenue Ecosystem**
**The Problem:** A private equity firm asks you: "Where does sport revenue come from, and which streams matter most?" Can you map the five major revenue sources and explain how they interconnect?

**What you'll need to know:**
- Media rights, ticketing, sponsorship, merchandising, betting/gaming
- Relative size and growth trajectory of each stream
- Why sport revenue streams are interdependent (ecosystem vs. portfolio)

**Test yourself now:** Can you name all five major revenue streams and estimate their percentage of total revenue? (Take the pre-assessment below to find out)

---

## **Challenge 2: Understand Sport's Unique Business Model**
**The Problem:** Your CEO asks: "Why can't we run a sports team like we run our hotel chain?" Can you explain what makes sport economics fundamentally different?

**What you'll need to know:**
- Why competitors must collaborate financially (revenue sharing, draft systems)
- The concept of competitive balance as an economic asset
- How sport creates value through uncertainty of outcome

**Test yourself now:** Can you explain why the NFL shares 60% of all revenue equally, and whether that's good or bad for business? (Pre-assessment question 3)

---

## **Challenge 3: Evaluate Growth Potential vs. Risk**
**The Problem:** You have $50 million to invest across five revenue streams. Some offer high growth but high risk (betting). Others offer stability but limited upside (ticketing). Can you build a portfolio that maximizes revenue while managing vulnerability?

**What you'll need to know:**
- Which streams are capacity-constrained (ceiling effects)
- Which streams face regulatory or market uncertainty
- How to balance growth, stability, and diversification

**Test yourself now:** Which revenue stream has the highest growth rate right now, and why? (Pre-assessment question 5)

---

## **Challenge 4: Analyze Revenue Sharing Models**
**The Problem:** The Vancouver Canucks receive $X million from NHL revenue sharing but contribute $Y million to the pool. The team's owner asks: "Are we better off in a league with revenue sharing, or should we lobby to change the system?" Can you analyze the trade-offs?

**What you'll need to know:**
- How the NHL's revenue sharing formula works
- Which teams benefit (small market) vs. which contribute (large market)
- The strategic implications for competitive balance and franchise value

**Test yourself now:** Can you explain one advantage and one disadvantage of revenue sharing for a mid-market team? (Pre-assessment question 7)

---

## **Ready to Test Your Knowledge?**

Before you dive into this week's content, take the 10-question Revenue Knowledge Quiz below. This isn't graded—it's a self-diagnostic to help you understand:

- What you already know (so you can focus on what's new)
- Where you have knowledge gaps (so you know what to prioritize)
- How your business intuition applies to sport (or doesn't)

**Your results will give you a personalized learning path for this week.**

Let's see what you've got! ↓
