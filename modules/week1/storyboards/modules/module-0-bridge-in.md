## Element 1: Bridge Video Scenario

**File:** `week1-bridge-scenario.mp4`
**Duration:** 2-3 minutes
**Caption File:** ⚠️ **PENDING PRODUCTION** - Needs HeyGen video + SRT caption file
**Format:** Direct-to-camera SME presentation

### Video Script: "The $100 Million Question"

```
[0:00-0:20] INTRODUCTION

SME: "Hi, I'm [NAME], and I've spent [X] years working in professional sport—
most recently as [ROLE] at [ORGANIZATION]. I've been on both sides of the table
for deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

And I want to start this course with a problem that's kept me up at night."

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "The $100 Million Question"]


[0:20-1:10] THE PARADOX SETUP

SME: "Imagine you're the GM of an NHL team. You just signed Connor McDavid—
the best player in hockey—to a $100 million, 8-year contract.

That's $12.5 million per year. Your CFO tracks the immediate impacts:
• Ticket sales jump $5 million
• Jersey sales spike $3 million
• That's $8 million in new revenue

Your board looks at these numbers and asks the obvious question:
'Why did we just LOSE $4.5 million per year on this deal?'

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "$12.5M cost - $8M revenue = -$4.5M loss?"]


[1:10-1:50] REFRAMING THE PROBLEM

SME: "Here's what I learned the hard way: If you're asking that question,
you're measuring the WRONG things.

Because Connor McDavid isn't worth $8 million to your organization.
He's worth $30 to $40 million per year.

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Actual Value: $30-40M/year"]

The problem isn't the numbers. The problem is understanding how sport revenue
works DIFFERENTLY than almost any other business.


[1:50-2:30] CALL-TO-ACTION

SME: "This week, you're going to learn how to see that ecosystem. You'll map
five major revenue streams in professional sport. You'll understand why they're
interdependent. And by the end, you'll be able to defend that $100 million
contract to a skeptical board—with numbers they can't argue with.

But first, I want to know: Do you ALREADY have the knowledge to solve this
problem? Take the diagnostic exercise that follows this video.

Let's find out what you already know... and what you're about to discover."

[END: 2:30]
```

## Element 2: AI Roleplay Scenario - The $100M Question

**Scenario Title:** "The $100 Million Question: Can You Solve It Now?"

**Purpose:** Diagnostic activity that reveals knowledge gaps about sports revenue ecosystems before content delivery. Students attempt to explain the Connor McDavid contract paradox using current understanding—most will struggle, creating motivation for Week 1 content.

**When to Use:** Immediately after the bridge video (Element 1)

**Assessment Type:** Diagnostic/Formative (not graded)

---

### Uplimit AI Roleplay Configuration

**Tab 1: Learning Outcome**

**Widget Name:** The $100 Million Question

**Learning Outcome:**
```
Students will demonstrate their current understanding of sports revenue ecosystems by attempting to explain the Connor McDavid contract paradox ($12.5M cost vs. $8M direct revenue). This diagnostic activity will reveal gaps in three key areas:

1. Revenue streams knowledge (can they identify all 5 major revenue sources beyond tickets/jerseys?)
2. Ecosystem thinking (do they understand how revenue streams are interdependent?)
3. Amplification effects (can they explain how star players create value across multiple streams?)

Success = Student finishes knowing exactly what they DON'T know yet, with motivation to learn Week 1 content.
```

**Scenario Setup:** Diagnostic (pre-learning assessment)

---

**Tab 2: Scenario**

**Context:**
```
A junior analyst at an NHL franchise has been asked by their executive to explain the Connor McDavid contract dilemma to the board. The board sees $12.5M/year in salary cost but only $8M in direct revenue (tickets + jerseys), creating an apparent $4.5M annual loss. The learner will attempt to explain why the deal makes financial sense, revealing their current understanding of sports revenue streams, ecosystem interdependencies, and star player value amplification. This diagnostic conversation helps identify knowledge gaps before Week 1 content delivery.
```

**Role of AI (Executive):**
```
A senior NHL executive who asks probing questions to help the junior analyst discover gaps in their understanding of sports revenue valuation.
```

**Role of Student:**
```
The learner plays the role of a junior analyst attempting to explain the Connor McDavid contract's financial logic to their executive using pre-existing knowledge.
```

---

**Tab 3: Hidden Context**

```
**AI Character Context:**
You are a senior NHL executive conducting a diagnostic conversation. The student is encountering sports revenue ecosystems for the first time. Most will struggle—this is intentional and pedagogically valuable.

**What Students Typically Miss (use to guide probing):**
- Media rights amplification (star players drive TV ratings, which drives media revenue)
- Sponsorship value (brands pay premium to associate with star players)
- Merchandise beyond jerseys (memorabilia, licensed products, digital content)
- Betting and fantasy engagement (star players drive betting volume)
- Secondary ticket market effects (playoff runs, premium games)
- League revenue sharing (how individual team success affects league-wide revenue)

**AI Personality Traits:**
- Patient but probing: You know they're learning, so you don't expect perfection—but you want to understand their thinking
- Business-focused: You care about clear explanations backed by strategic reasoning, not jargon
- Socratic: When they struggle, you ask questions that help them discover gaps rather than lecturing
- Realistic: You acknowledge that sports revenue is complex with interdependent streams

**Conversation Strategy:**

Wait for the student to start the conversation. They've been asked to explain why the McDavid contract makes financial sense. Listen to their opening explanation, then respond with probing questions based on what they say:

1. If they mention only tickets/jerseys, ask: "What other revenue streams does an NHL team have beyond gate receipts and merchandise?"

2. If they list streams but treat them as independent, ask: "Do you think these revenue streams operate independently, or are they connected somehow?"

3. If they don't mention ecosystem effects, ask: "When McDavid scores a highlight-reel goal, who benefits besides the Oilers? Think about the league level."

4. Closing (after 3-4 exchanges): Acknowledge their effort and gaps: "You've identified some pieces, but I can tell you're missing how these revenue streams amplify each other—that's the key to understanding why star players are worth more than the direct revenue suggests. This week's content will give you the framework to answer this question confidently."

Exit gracefully after 3-4 exchanges even if they're still struggling—the goal is diagnosis, not mastery.

**Conversation Objectives (3-4 exchanges):**
1. **Opening:** Let student explain their initial thinking without interruption
2. **Probe #1:** If they focus only on tickets/jerseys, ask about other revenue streams
3. **Probe #2:** If they don't see interdependencies, ask about ecosystem effects
4. **Closing:** Acknowledge effort, name specific gaps (e.g., "You identified merchandise but missed media rights amplification"), and encourage them that Week 1 will fill these gaps

**Success Indicators:**
- ✅ Student attempts answer (even if incomplete)
- ✅ Student recognizes their knowledge gaps
- ✅ Student feels motivated to learn, not defeated

**After 3-4 exchanges:** Provide rubric-aligned feedback using the 3 criteria defined in the Criteria tab.
```

---

**Tab 4: Criteria**

**CRITERION 1: Revenue Streams Knowledge**

**Points:** 10

**Description:**
The learner identifies multiple sports revenue sources beyond tickets and jerseys.

**Does not meet expectations:**
The learner mentions only tickets and jerseys or provides minimal identification of revenue streams without demonstrating understanding of the five major sources (media rights, sponsorship, merchandise, betting/gaming, premium experiences).

**Partially meets expectations:**
The learner identifies 2-3 revenue streams beyond tickets/jerseys but may miss key streams (media rights, betting) or provide limited explanation of how they contribute to team revenue.

**Fully meets expectations:**
The learner identifies 4-5 revenue streams beyond tickets/jerseys (media rights, sponsorship, merchandise, betting/gaming, premium experiences) and demonstrates understanding that these represent diverse revenue sources for professional sports teams.

---

**CRITERION 2: Ecosystem Thinking**

**Points:** 10

**Description:**
The learner recognizes that revenue streams are interdependent rather than independent.

**Does not meet expectations:**
The learner treats each revenue stream as independent, failing to recognize connections between streams (e.g., how TV ratings affect sponsorship value, how star players affect multiple streams simultaneously).

**Partially meets expectations:**
The learner demonstrates basic awareness that streams are connected but provides limited explanation of specific interdependencies or misses the cascading/amplification effects.

**Fully meets expectations:**
The learner clearly articulates how revenue streams are interdependent—explaining how star players drive TV ratings (media), attract sponsors (sponsorship), sell merchandise (retail), increase betting engagement (gaming), and create playoff demand (premium tickets), with effects cascading across the ecosystem.

---

**CRITERION 3: Amplification Effects**

**Points:** 10

**Description:**
The learner explains how star players create value that exceeds direct, measurable revenue.

**Does not meet expectations:**
The learner focuses only on direct, measurable revenue (ticket sales, jersey sales) without recognizing amplification effects across the ecosystem.

**Partially meets expectations:**
The learner mentions that star players have value beyond direct revenue but provides limited explanation of the amplification mechanism or specific examples.

**Fully meets expectations:**
The learner clearly explains that star players like McDavid create amplification effects—driving $30-40M in total value through media ratings, national broadcast premium, sponsorship uplift, merchandise across the league, and playoff revenue potential—far exceeding the $8M in direct ticket/jersey revenue.

### Student-Facing Instructions (Place as Text element BEFORE AI Roleplay)

```markdown
### Your Role
You are a **junior analyst** at an NHL franchise. Your executive has just presented the Connor McDavid contract dilemma to the board: $12.5M/year cost, but only $8M in direct revenue. The board is questioning why you'd "lose" $4.5M per year.

### Getting Started
**You need to start the conversation.** Begin by explaining to your executive why you think this deal actually makes financial sense despite the apparent loss.

### Your Goal
⚠️ **This is diagnostic—you're not expected to ace this!** Most students struggle before learning Week 1 content. The goal is to discover gaps in your understanding so you know what to focus on this week.

### Conversation Length
3-4 exchanges with your executive. If you get stuck, that's the point—those are your learning priorities.

## Element 3: Infobox - The Revenue Problem

```
Title: ◉ The Revenue Problem Professional Sport Faces

Professional sports teams operate with a business model that defies conventional logic: competitors must collaborate financially, revenue sources are deeply interdependent, and investments in one area create unpredictable ripple effects across the ecosystem. This week you'll explore why teams "overpay" for star players, how leagues balance entrepreneurial success with competitive fairness, and which revenue streams are growing versus hitting capacity limits. By the end, you'll solve these problems using real NHL data—but first, let's see what you already know.

## Element 4D: MC Question 2 - Ecosystem Thinking `[v4.0.0]`

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Multiple Choice Question** element
2. Configure as follows:

**Question:**
```
What is the PRIMARY reason sports revenue streams are described as an "ecosystem" rather than a "portfolio"?
```

**Options:**
- A: Sports revenue is unpredictable like natural ecosystems
- B: Success in one stream creates ripple effects that impact all other streams ✅
- C: Revenue streams compete with each other for fan attention
- D: Different streams have different risk profiles like diversified investments

**After Submission:**
```
The "ecosystem" label highlights how sports revenue streams are deeply interconnected—success in one area amplifies others across the entire system.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Exactly! A star player signing drives TV ratings, attracts sponsors, sells jerseys, increases betting engagement, and fills seats—cascading effects across all streams.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Think about what happens when one revenue stream succeeds. Does it affect the others? The ecosystem concept is about interdependence, not unpredictability or competition.

### Challenge 2: Explain Sport's Paradoxes

**The Problem:** A tech entrepreneur asks: "Why would competitors ever share revenue? In my industry, we crush the competition." Can you explain sport's unique business model where rivals must collaborate?

**What you'll need to know:**
- Why competitors need each other to succeed (competitive interdependence)
- What "uncertainty of outcome" means and why it's the core product
- How salary caps, drafts, and revenue sharing create competitive balance

**Test yourself:** Can you explain why the Yankees need the Red Sox to be financially healthy?
```

## Element 4F: MC Question 3 - Competitive Balance `[v4.0.0]`

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Multiple Choice Question** element
2. Configure as follows:

**Question:**
```
Why do professional sports leagues require competitors to collaborate financially (through revenue sharing, salary caps, and draft systems)?
```

**Options:**
- A: Government regulations mandate revenue sharing for anti-trust exemptions
- B: Competitive balance creates uncertainty of outcome, which is the core product fans pay for ✅
- C: Team owners are more altruistic than typical business leaders
- D: Small-market teams threaten to leave if they don't receive financial support

**After Submission:**
```
Sports leagues are unique: they need competitive balance to maintain the uncertainty of outcome that fans pay for. Unlike typical businesses, crushing your competitors hurts everyone.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Perfect! If the Yankees win 95% of games, fewer fans watch and league-wide revenue declines—hurting even the Yankees.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Think about what makes fans watch games. It's not altruism or regulations—it's about the core product sports sells: competitive uncertainty.
```

**Points:** 1 | **Shuffle options:** Yes

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Multiple Choice Question** element
2. Configure as follows:

**Question:**
```
What makes a sports franchise fundamentally different from a typical consumer goods company like Nike?
```

**Options:**
- A: Sports franchises sell entertainment experiences rather than physical products
- B: Sports franchises need their competitors to succeed for the league product to have value ✅
- C: Sports franchises generate revenue from multiple streams instead of single products
- D: Sports franchises rely more heavily on media rights than physical sales

**After Submission:**
```
The fundamental paradox of sports business: your success depends on your competitors' success. This is structurally different from any other industry.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Exactly! Nike wants to crush Adidas. But the Yankees need the Red Sox to be financially healthy because fans don't pay to watch blowouts.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Many businesses sell experiences or have multiple revenue streams. What's unique about sports is the relationship between competitors—they need each other.

```markdown
---

### Challenge 3: Assess Growth vs. Risk

**The Problem:** An investment committee asks: "Which revenue streams have the most upside? Which have the most risk?" Can you rank the five streams by growth potential and identify their ceiling effects?

**What you'll need to know:**
- Which streams face physical capacity constraints (ceiling effects)
- Which streams have the highest growth potential
- Where regulatory and market risks create uncertainty

**Test yourself:** Can you explain why ticketing revenue has a hard ceiling while betting revenue doesn't?
```

---

## Element 4I: MC Question 5 - Growth Ceiling Effects `[v4.0.0]`

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Multiple Choice Question** element
2. Configure as follows:

**Question:**
```
Which revenue stream faces the MOST significant "ceiling effect" limiting future growth?
```

**Options:**
- A: Media Rights (constrained by cord-cutting trends)
- B: Ticketing & Live Events (limited by stadium capacity) ✅
- C: Sponsorship & Advertising (saturated with too many brand partners)
- D: Betting & Gaming (regulatory restrictions limit market access)

**After Submission:**
```
"Ceiling effects" refer to hard constraints that limit growth potential. Some streams face physical limits that can't be overcome, while others face soft constraints that can change.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Exactly! Stadiums have fixed capacity and limited home games per season. Once you've sold out every seat at maximum price, growth stops. Other streams can scale globally.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Think about which constraint is truly fixed. Cord-cutting, saturation, and regulations can all change over time—but stadium capacity is a physical limit.
```

**Points:** 1 | **Shuffle options:** Yes

## Element 4J: MC Question 6 - Betting Regulatory Risk `[v4.0.0]`

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Multiple Choice Question** element
2. Configure as follows:

**Question:**
```
What is the PRIMARY risk of investing heavily in betting/gaming partnerships?
```

**Options:**
- A: Betting reduces fan interest in attending games live
- B: Regulatory uncertainty could change the landscape quickly ✅
- C: Betting appeals only to young male demographics, limiting growth
- D: Betting partnerships damage the league's family-friendly brand image

**After Submission:**
```
High-growth revenue streams often carry proportional risks. Understanding the source and nature of these risks is critical for strategic planning.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Correct! Betting offers 300%+ growth potential but laws vary by jurisdiction and can change overnight. A $50M/year partner could lose market access through regulatory changes.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Evidence shows betting increases engagement, demographics are expanding, and most leagues have embraced these partnerships. The primary risk is external—regulatory uncertainty.

### Challenge 4: Defend Revenue Sharing

**The Problem:** A large-market team owner argues: "Why should we subsidize our competitors? We earned this revenue." Can you defend why revenue sharing benefits even the teams that contribute more than they receive?

**What you'll need to know:**
- How revenue sharing works in major leagues (NFL shares ~60%)
- Who benefits most from redistribution (small vs. large markets)
- Why large-market teams accept this structure

**Test yourself:** Can you explain why the Dallas Cowboys benefit from subsidizing Green Bay, even though Dallas contributes more than it receives?

**Question:**
```
The NFL shares approximately 60% of all revenue equally among teams. Which team type benefits MOST from this structure?
```

**Options:**
- A: Large-market teams like the Dallas Cowboys and New York Giants
- B: Small-market teams like the Green Bay Packers and Buffalo Bills ✅
- C: Teams with new stadiums that generate premium revenue
- D: All teams benefit equally since the revenue is shared 50/50

**After Submission:**
```
Revenue sharing redistributes wealth across the league to maintain competitive balance. Understanding who benefits most—and why other teams accept it—reveals the economics of league governance.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Exactly! Green Bay (population 320,000) receives the same share of $110B in media rights as the NY Giants (population 20M). This allows small markets to compete for talent.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Think about which teams receive more from the shared pool than they contribute. Large-market teams generate more local revenue but must share national revenue equally.

**System Prompt:**
```
You are a supportive learning coach helping MBA students interpret their pre-assessment results for a sports business course. Students just completed a 7-question diagnostic quiz covering four learning outcomes:

**WLO 1.1 - Revenue Streams:** Which streams dominate (media rights 40-60%, ticketing 20-30%, sponsorship 15-20%, merchandise 10-15%, betting emerging)
**WLO 1.2 - Unique Business Model:** Sport's paradoxes (competitors collaborate, uncertainty of outcome is the product, competitive balance required)
**WLO 1.3 - Growth vs. Risk:** Growth potential by stream (betting high-growth but regulatory risk, ticketing has ceiling effects due to capacity)
**WLO 1.4 - Revenue Sharing:** Why leagues redistribute wealth (small markets benefit, ensures competitive balance, large markets benefit from strong league)

**Your role:**
1. Ask students how many questions they answered correctly (0-7)
2. Provide personalized guidance based on their score:
   - **0-2/7:** "You're starting fresh—perfect! This week's content will build strong foundations. Focus on Module 3's core concepts and take time with each interactive widget."
   - **3-4/7:** "Solid baseline—you have some pieces of the puzzle. This week will help you connect those concepts into a comprehensive framework. Pay special attention to the ecosystem thinking in Module 3."
   - **5-6/7:** "Strong foundation! You're ready to dive deep into applications. Challenge yourself with the Nashville Predators case analysis and Revenue Empire Builder simulation."
   - **7/7:** "Excellent! You already understand core concepts. This week, focus on nuanced applications—how revenue sharing creates competitive tensions, why ceiling effects limit ticketing growth, how regulatory risks affect betting partnerships."
3. If they ask about specific questions, provide brief clarifications using the WLO concepts above
4. Encourage them that pre-assessments reveal learning opportunities, not deficiencies
5. Direct them to Module 1 (Executive Perspectives) after discussion

**Tone:** Supportive, encouraging, concrete (use specific examples), MBA-level (business-focused not academic)

**Do NOT:**
- Provide quiz answers directly (if they ask, say "The quiz helps you self-diagnose, but I can discuss concepts")
- Overwhelm them with too much content (keep responses 2-3 sentences)
- Make them feel bad about low scores (frame as opportunities)
```

**Welcome Message:**
```
Hi! I'm here to help you interpret your pre-assessment results and plan your learning path for Week 1. How many questions did you answer correctly out of 7? Or if you have questions about specific concepts from the quiz, I'm happy to discuss them!

**The Project:**
You'll select a Canadian city and build a complete expansion proposal, applying each week's frameworks as you go.

**5 Milestones Across 5 Weeks:**
- **Milestone 1 (Week 1):** Market Selection & Revenue Projections — Choose your city and project 5-year revenue using the five-stream model
- **Milestone 2 (Week 2):** Media & Content Strategy — Design your franchise's media rights approach and fan engagement plan
- **Milestone 3 (Week 3):** Sponsorship & Betting Strategy — Build sponsorship packages and betting integration plan
- **Milestone 4 (Week 4):** Brand Strategy & Launch — Develop your franchise brand identity and launch campaign
- **Milestone 5 (Week 5):** Final Proposal — Integrate everything into a board-ready expansion pitch

**This Week's Focus:**
By the end of Week 1, you'll submit Milestone 1: a 2-3 page Market Analysis Brief selecting your expansion city and projecting its revenue potential.

**Coming Up Next:**
Two graphic novels introduce this week's concepts. "Expansion Day" follows Maya Chen's fight to bring CFL football to Halifax—the same challenge you'll tackle in your project. "Five Streams" shows how Jessica Torres saved the Nashville Predators by mastering the five revenue streams you'll learn this week.
