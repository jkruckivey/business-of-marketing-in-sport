## Element 1: Bridge Video Scenario

**File:** `week1-bridge-scenario.mp4`
**Duration:** 2-3 minutes
**Caption File:** ⚠️ **PENDING PRODUCTION** - Needs HeyGen video + SRT caption file
**Format:** Direct-to-camera SME presentation

### Video Script: "The $100 Million Question"

```
[0:00-0:20] INTRODUCTION

SME: "Hi, I'm [NAME], and I've spent [X] years working in professional sport—
most recently as [ROLE] at [ORGANIZATION]. I've been on both sides of the table
for deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

And I want to start this course with a problem that's kept me up at night."

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "The $100 Million Question"]


[0:20-1:10] THE PARADOX SETUP

SME: "Imagine you're the GM of an NHL team. You just signed Connor McDavid—
the best player in hockey—to a $100 million, 8-year contract.

That's $12.5 million per year. Your CFO tracks the immediate impacts:
• Ticket sales jump $5 million
• Jersey sales spike $3 million
• That's $8 million in new revenue

Your board looks at these numbers and asks the obvious question:
'Why did we just LOSE $4.5 million per year on this deal?'

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "$12.5M cost - $8M revenue = -$4.5M loss?"]


[1:10-1:50] REFRAMING THE PROBLEM

SME: "Here's what I learned the hard way: If you're asking that question,
you're measuring the WRONG things.

Because Connor McDavid isn't worth $8 million to your organization.
He's worth $30 to $40 million per year.

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Actual Value: $30-40M/year"]

The problem isn't the numbers. The problem is understanding how sport revenue
works DIFFERENTLY than almost any other business.


[1:50-2:30] CALL-TO-ACTION

SME: "This week, you're going to learn how to see that ecosystem. You'll map
five major revenue streams in professional sport. You'll understand why they're
interdependent. And by the end, you'll be able to defend that $100 million
contract to a skeptical board—with numbers they can't argue with.

But first, I want to know: Do you ALREADY have the knowledge to solve this
problem? Take the diagnostic exercise that follows this video.

Let's find out what you already know... and what you're about to discover."

[END: 2:30]
```

## Element 2: AI Roleplay Scenario - The $100M Question

**Scenario Title:** "The $100 Million Question: Can You Solve It Now?"

**Purpose:** Diagnostic activity that reveals knowledge gaps about sports revenue ecosystems before content delivery. Students attempt to explain the Connor McDavid contract paradox using current understanding—most will struggle, creating motivation for Week 1 content.

**When to Use:** Immediately after the bridge video (Element 1)

**Assessment Type:** Diagnostic/Formative (not graded)

---

### Uplimit AI Roleplay Configuration

**Tab 1: Learning Outcome**

**Widget Name:** The $100 Million Question

**Learning Outcome:**
```
Students will demonstrate their current understanding of sports revenue ecosystems by attempting to explain the Connor McDavid contract paradox ($12.5M cost vs. $8M direct revenue). This diagnostic activity will reveal gaps in three key areas:

1. Revenue streams knowledge (can they identify all 5 major revenue sources beyond tickets/jerseys?)
2. Ecosystem thinking (do they understand how revenue streams are interdependent?)
3. Amplification effects (can they explain how star players create value across multiple streams?)

Success = Student finishes knowing exactly what they DON'T know yet, with motivation to learn Week 1 content.
```

**Scenario Setup:** Diagnostic (pre-learning assessment)

---

**Tab 2: Scenario**

**Context:**
```
A junior analyst at an NHL franchise has been asked by their executive to explain the Connor McDavid contract dilemma to the board. The board sees $12.5M/year in salary cost but only $8M in direct revenue (tickets + jerseys), creating an apparent $4.5M annual loss. The learner will attempt to explain why the deal makes financial sense, revealing their current understanding of sports revenue streams, ecosystem interdependencies, and star player value amplification. This diagnostic conversation helps identify knowledge gaps before Week 1 content delivery.
```

**Role of AI (Executive):**
```
A senior NHL executive who asks probing questions to help the junior analyst discover gaps in their understanding of sports revenue valuation.
```

**Role of Student:**
```
The learner plays the role of a junior analyst attempting to explain the Connor McDavid contract's financial logic to their executive using pre-existing knowledge.
```

---

**Tab 3: Hidden Context**

```
**AI Character Context:**
You are a senior NHL executive conducting a diagnostic conversation. The student is encountering sports revenue ecosystems for the first time. Most will struggle—this is intentional and pedagogically valuable.

**What Students Typically Miss (use to guide probing):**
- Media rights amplification (star players drive TV ratings, which drives media revenue)
- Sponsorship value (brands pay premium to associate with star players)
- Merchandise beyond jerseys (memorabilia, licensed products, digital content)
- Betting and fantasy engagement (star players drive betting volume)
- Secondary ticket market effects (playoff runs, premium games)
- League revenue sharing (how individual team success affects league-wide revenue)

**AI Personality Traits:**
- Patient but probing: You know they're learning, so you don't expect perfection—but you want to understand their thinking
- Business-focused: You care about clear explanations backed by strategic reasoning, not jargon
- Socratic: When they struggle, you ask questions that help them discover gaps rather than lecturing
- Realistic: You acknowledge that sports revenue is complex with interdependent streams

**Conversation Strategy:**

Wait for the student to start the conversation. They've been asked to explain why the McDavid contract makes financial sense. Listen to their opening explanation, then respond with probing questions based on what they say:

1. If they mention only tickets/jerseys, ask: "What other revenue streams does an NHL team have beyond gate receipts and merchandise?"

2. If they list streams but treat them as independent, ask: "Do you think these revenue streams operate independently, or are they connected somehow?"

3. If they don't mention ecosystem effects, ask: "When McDavid scores a highlight-reel goal, who benefits besides the Oilers? Think about the league level."

4. Closing (after 3-4 exchanges): Acknowledge their effort and gaps: "You've identified some pieces, but I can tell you're missing how these revenue streams amplify each other—that's the key to understanding why star players are worth more than the direct revenue suggests. This week's content will give you the framework to answer this question confidently."

Exit gracefully after 3-4 exchanges even if they're still struggling—the goal is diagnosis, not mastery.

**Conversation Objectives (3-4 exchanges):**
1. **Opening:** Let student explain their initial thinking without interruption
2. **Probe #1:** If they focus only on tickets/jerseys, ask about other revenue streams
3. **Probe #2:** If they don't see interdependencies, ask about ecosystem effects
4. **Closing:** Acknowledge effort, name specific gaps (e.g., "You identified merchandise but missed media rights amplification"), and encourage them that Week 1 will fill these gaps

**Success Indicators:**
- ✅ Student attempts answer (even if incomplete)
- ✅ Student recognizes their knowledge gaps
- ✅ Student feels motivated to learn, not defeated

**After 3-4 exchanges:** Provide rubric-aligned feedback using the 3 criteria defined in the Criteria tab.
```

**Tab 4: Criteria**

**CRITERION 1: Revenue Streams Knowledge**

**Points:** 10

**Description:**
The learner identifies multiple sports revenue sources beyond tickets and jerseys.

**Does not meet expectations:**
The learner mentions only tickets and jerseys or provides minimal identification of revenue streams without demonstrating understanding of the five major sources (media rights, sponsorship, merchandise, betting/gaming, premium experiences).

**Partially meets expectations:**
The learner identifies 2-3 revenue streams beyond tickets/jerseys but may miss key streams (media rights, betting) or provide limited explanation of how they contribute to team revenue.

**Fully meets expectations:**
The learner identifies 4-5 revenue streams beyond tickets/jerseys (media rights, sponsorship, merchandise, betting/gaming, premium experiences) and demonstrates understanding that these represent diverse revenue sources for professional sports teams.

---

**CRITERION 2: Ecosystem Thinking**

**Points:** 10

**Description:**
The learner recognizes that revenue streams are interdependent rather than independent.

**Does not meet expectations:**
The learner treats each revenue stream as independent, failing to recognize connections between streams (e.g., how TV ratings affect sponsorship value, how star players affect multiple streams simultaneously).

**Partially meets expectations:**
The learner demonstrates basic awareness that streams are connected but provides limited explanation of specific interdependencies or misses the cascading/amplification effects.

**Fully meets expectations:**
The learner clearly articulates how revenue streams are interdependent—explaining how star players drive TV ratings (media), attract sponsors (sponsorship), sell merchandise (retail), increase betting engagement (gaming), and create playoff demand (premium tickets), with effects cascading across the ecosystem.

---

**CRITERION 3: Amplification Effects**

**Points:** 10

**Description:**
The learner explains how star players create value that exceeds direct, measurable revenue.

**Does not meet expectations:**
The learner focuses only on direct, measurable revenue (ticket sales, jersey sales) without recognizing amplification effects across the ecosystem.

**Partially meets expectations:**
The learner mentions that star players have value beyond direct revenue but provides limited explanation of the amplification mechanism or specific examples.

**Fully meets expectations:**
The learner clearly explains that star players like McDavid create amplification effects—driving $30-40M in total value through media ratings, national broadcast premium, sponsorship uplift, merchandise across the league, and playoff revenue potential—far exceeding the $8M in direct ticket/jersey revenue.

### Student-Facing Instructions (Place as Text element BEFORE AI Roleplay)

```markdown
### Your Role
You are a **junior analyst** at an NHL franchise. Your executive has just presented the Connor McDavid contract dilemma to the board: $12.5M/year cost, but only $8M in direct revenue. The board is questioning why you'd "lose" $4.5M per year.

### Getting Started
**You need to start the conversation.** Begin by explaining to your executive why you think this deal actually makes financial sense despite the apparent loss.

### Your Goal
⚠️ **This is diagnostic—you're not expected to ace this!** Most students struggle before learning Week 1 content. The goal is to discover gaps in your understanding so you know what to focus on this week.

### Conversation Length
3-4 exchanges with your executive. If you get stuck, that's the point—those are your learning priorities.

## Element 3: Infobox - The Revenue Problem

```
Title: ◉ The Revenue Problem Professional Sport Faces

Professional sports teams operate with a business model that defies conventional logic: competitors must collaborate financially, revenue sources are deeply interdependent, and investments in one area create unpredictable ripple effects across the ecosystem. This week you'll explore why teams "overpay" for star players, how leagues balance entrepreneurial success with competitive fairness, and which revenue streams are growing versus hitting capacity limits. By the end, you'll solve these problems using real NHL data—but first, let's see what you already know.

### Diagnostic Activity: Revenue Strategy Pre-Assessment

**Purpose: Discover What You Already Know**

Before exploring Week 1's content, complete this 7-question diagnostic quiz. It tests your baseline understanding of sports revenue ecosystems across four learning outcomes:

- **Revenue Streams** (WLO 1.1): Do you know which streams dominate sports business?
- **Unique Business Model** (WLO 1.2): Can you explain sport's paradoxes?
- **Growth vs. Risk** (WLO 1.3): Do you understand ceiling effects and regulatory risks?
- **Revenue Sharing** (WLO 1.4): Can you explain why leagues redistribute wealth?

**Not graded—purely diagnostic.** Lower scores (0-4/7) signal areas to emphasize this week. Higher scores (5-7/7) indicate strong foundations to build upon.

## Element 4B: MC Question 1 - Media Rights Revenue `[v3.0.0]`

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Multiple Choice Question** element
2. Configure as follows:

**Question Text:**
```
Which revenue stream typically accounts for the LARGEST percentage of total revenue for major professional sports leagues like the NFL?
```

**Options:**

| Option | Text | Feedback |
|--------|------|----------|
| A | Ticketing & Live Events (20-30%) | Ticketing is important but not the largest stream. While gate receipts account for 20-30% of revenue for most leagues, another stream dominates the revenue mix. Think about where leagues get long-term, predictable income from broadcasting deals. |
| B ✅ | Media Rights (40-60%) | Correct! Media rights—the fees paid by broadcasters and streaming services to air games—represent the largest revenue stream for most professional leagues, typically accounting for 40-60% of total revenue. The NFL's current media rights contracts total $110 billion over 11 years ($10B/year), while the English Premier League generates over $5 billion per year from broadcast rights. |
| C | Sponsorship & Advertising (15-20%) | Sponsorship is valuable but not the largest stream. Corporate partnerships typically account for 15-20% of revenue. The dominant revenue stream is more predictable and comes from long-term broadcasting agreements. |
| D | Merchandising & Licensing (10-15%) | Merchandise is the smallest major revenue stream, typically 10-15% of total revenue. Another stream provides 3-4× more revenue through multi-year broadcasting contracts. |

1. Select **Multiple Choice Question** element
2. Configure as follows:

**Question Text:**
```
What is the PRIMARY reason sports revenue streams are described as an "ecosystem" rather than a "portfolio"?
```

**Options:**

| Option | Text | Feedback |
|--------|------|----------|
| A | Sports revenue is unpredictable like natural ecosystems | While sports revenue has variability, that's not why we use "ecosystem" terminology. The key distinction is about interdependence, not unpredictability. Think about what happens when one revenue stream succeeds—does it affect the others? |
| B ✅ | Success in one stream creates ripple effects that impact all other streams | Exactly right! Sports revenue streams are deeply interconnected—success in one area amplifies others. A star player signing drives TV ratings (media rights), attracts sponsors (partnerships), sells jerseys (merchandise), increases betting engagement (gaming), and fills seats (ticketing). This cascading effect makes sports revenue an ecosystem where investments in one stream create value across all streams. |
| C | Revenue streams compete with each other for fan attention | Actually, sports revenue streams rarely compete—they usually reinforce each other. The "ecosystem" label emphasizes interdependence, not competition. When TV ratings rise, it typically helps rather than hurts ticket sales, sponsorship, and betting engagement. |
| D | Different streams have different risk profiles like diversified investments | While streams do have different risk profiles, that would support calling it a "portfolio" (diversification). The "ecosystem" label specifically highlights how streams are interconnected and amplify each other. |

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Multiple Choice Question** element
2. Configure as follows:

**Question Text:**
```
Why do professional sports leagues require competitors to collaborate financially (through revenue sharing, salary caps, and draft systems)?
```

**Options:**

| Option | Text | Feedback |
|--------|------|----------|
| A | Government regulations mandate revenue sharing for anti-trust exemptions | While some leagues have anti-trust considerations, that's not the fundamental business reason. The core reason relates to the product sports leagues sell—what makes fans watch games? |
| B ✅ | Competitive balance creates uncertainty of outcome, which is the core product fans pay for | Perfect! Unlike traditional businesses where crushing competitors is the goal, sports leagues need competitive balance to maintain the uncertainty of outcome that fans pay for. If the Yankees win 95% of games, fewer fans watch and league-wide revenue declines—hurting even the Yankees. Revenue sharing ensures competitive games that maximize total fan interest. |
| C | Team owners are more altruistic than typical business leaders | This isn't about altruism—it's strategic business thinking. Even self-interested owners benefit from competitive balance because it grows total league revenue. |
| D | Small-market teams threaten to leave if they don't receive financial support | While relocation threats exist, they're symptoms of a deeper structural need. The fundamental reason relates to the core product sports sells—competitive uncertainty. |

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Multiple Choice Question** element
2. Configure as follows:

**Question Text:**
```
What makes a sports franchise fundamentally different from a typical consumer goods company like Nike?
```

**Options:**

| Option | Text | Feedback |
|--------|------|----------|
| A | Sports franchises sell entertainment experiences rather than physical products | While sports do sell experiences, so do concert venues, theaters, and theme parks. This doesn't explain what makes sports franchises structurally unique. Think about the relationship between competitors. |
| B ✅ | Sports franchises need their competitors to succeed for the league product to have value | This is the fundamental paradox of sports business! Nike wants to crush Adidas—their business improves when competitors fail. But the Yankees need the Red Sox to be financially healthy and competitive because fans don't pay to watch blowouts. This unique interdependence with competitors distinguishes sports from typical businesses. |
| C | Sports franchises generate revenue from multiple streams instead of single products | Many businesses have multiple revenue streams (Amazon: retail, AWS, advertising). This doesn't explain what's structurally unique about sports. Focus on the relationship between competitors. |
| D | Sports franchises rely more heavily on media rights than physical sales | While media rights are important for sports, other industries also depend on broadcasting revenue. The unique aspect of sports relates to how franchises interact with their competitors—they need them to thrive. |

## Element 4F: MC Question 5 - Growth Ceiling Effects `[v3.0.0]`

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Multiple Choice Question** element
2. Configure as follows:

**Question Text:**
```
Which revenue stream faces the MOST significant "ceiling effect" limiting future growth?
```

**Options:**

| Option | Text | Feedback |
|--------|------|----------|
| A | Media Rights (constrained by cord-cutting trends) | While media rights face disruption from cord-cutting, they're not hitting capacity limits—streaming platforms are actually expanding reach globally. The stream with the most significant ceiling faces hard physical constraints. |
| B ✅ | Ticketing & Live Events (limited by stadium capacity) | Exactly! Ticketing faces hard physical constraints—stadiums have fixed capacity, and you can only host 8-10 home games per season. Once you've sold out every seat at maximum price, growth stops. This is why teams invest heavily in premium seating and dynamic pricing. Other streams (media, betting, merchandise) can scale globally without physical capacity limits. |
| C | Sponsorship & Advertising (saturated with too many brand partners) | While sponsorship faces saturation concerns, teams continually find new inventory (jersey patches, helmet decals, digital assets). The stream with the hardest ceiling is constrained by physical limits. |
| D | Betting & Gaming (regulatory restrictions limit market access) | Betting does face regulatory barriers, but those can change through legislation—we've seen rapid state-by-state expansion in the US. The stream with the most significant ceiling is constrained by unchangeable physical limits. |

**Points:** 1 | **Shuffle options:** Yes

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Multiple Choice Question** element
2. Configure as follows:

**Question Text:**
```
What is the PRIMARY risk of investing heavily in betting/gaming partnerships?
```

**Options:**

| Option | Text | Feedback |
|--------|------|----------|
| A | Betting reduces fan interest in attending games live | Evidence suggests betting increases engagement—fans watch more closely when they have money on the game. The primary risk isn't about fan behavior, but about external factors that could change the business landscape suddenly. |
| B ✅ | Regulatory uncertainty could change the landscape quickly | Correct! While betting/gaming offers high growth potential (300%+ growth in some markets), it faces significant regulatory uncertainty. Laws vary by state/province and country, and regulations can change rapidly—restricting advertising, imposing taxes, or even banning certain products. A betting partner worth $50M/year could lose market access overnight through regulatory changes. |
| C | Betting appeals only to young male demographics, limiting growth | While betting demographics do skew male, the market is expanding to broader audiences. The primary risk isn't demographic limitations but external factors that could fundamentally change the business overnight. |
| D | Betting partnerships damage the league's family-friendly brand image | While some leagues have brand concerns, most have embraced betting partnerships (NHL/BetMGM, NFL/DraftKings, NBA/FanDuel). The primary risk isn't brand damage but external factors that could eliminate the revenue stream entirely through sudden policy changes. |

The NFL shares approximately 60% of all revenue equally among teams. Which team type benefits MOST from this structure?
```

**Options:**

| Option | Text | Feedback |
|--------|------|----------|
| A | Large-market teams like the Dallas Cowboys and New York Giants | Large-market teams are net contributors to revenue sharing—they generate more local revenue but must share national media revenue equally. Think about which teams receive more from the shared pool than they contribute. |
| B ✅ | Small-market teams like the Green Bay Packers and Buffalo Bills | Exactly! Revenue sharing redistributes money from large-market teams to small-market teams. Green Bay, with a metro population of 320,000, receives the same share of the NFL's $110B media rights as the New York Giants (metro population 20 million). This allows small-market teams to compete for talent and maintain competitive balance. |
| C | Teams with new stadiums that generate premium revenue | Actually, stadium revenue (especially premium seating and luxury suites) is typically NOT shared—teams keep most local stadium revenue. Revenue sharing primarily redistributes national media rights and licensing revenue. |
| D | All teams benefit equally since the revenue is shared 50/50 | While national revenue is distributed equally, small-market teams benefit disproportionately because they generate less local revenue. A team like Green Bay receives the same share of media rights as Dallas, but Dallas also generates significantly more local revenue that isn't shared. |

**System Prompt:**
```
You are a supportive learning coach helping MBA students interpret their pre-assessment results for a sports business course. Students just completed a 7-question diagnostic quiz covering four learning outcomes:

**WLO 1.1 - Revenue Streams:** Which streams dominate (media rights 40-60%, ticketing 20-30%, sponsorship 15-20%, merchandise 10-15%, betting emerging)
**WLO 1.2 - Unique Business Model:** Sport's paradoxes (competitors collaborate, uncertainty of outcome is the product, competitive balance required)
**WLO 1.3 - Growth vs. Risk:** Growth potential by stream (betting high-growth but regulatory risk, ticketing has ceiling effects due to capacity)
**WLO 1.4 - Revenue Sharing:** Why leagues redistribute wealth (small markets benefit, ensures competitive balance, large markets benefit from strong league)

**Your role:**
1. Ask students how many questions they answered correctly (0-7)
2. Provide personalized guidance based on their score:
   - **0-2/7:** "You're starting fresh—perfect! This week's content will build strong foundations. Focus on Module 3's core concepts and take time with each interactive widget."
   - **3-4/7:** "Solid baseline—you have some pieces of the puzzle. This week will help you connect those concepts into a comprehensive framework. Pay special attention to the ecosystem thinking in Module 3."
   - **5-6/7:** "Strong foundation! You're ready to dive deep into applications. Challenge yourself with the Nashville Predators case analysis and Revenue Empire Builder simulation."
   - **7/7:** "Excellent! You already understand core concepts. This week, focus on nuanced applications—how revenue sharing creates competitive tensions, why ceiling effects limit ticketing growth, how regulatory risks affect betting partnerships."
3. If they ask about specific questions, provide brief clarifications using the WLO concepts above
4. Encourage them that pre-assessments reveal learning opportunities, not deficiencies
5. Direct them to Module 1 (Executive Perspectives) after discussion

**Tone:** Supportive, encouraging, concrete (use specific examples), MBA-level (business-focused not academic)

**Do NOT:**
- Provide quiz answers directly (if they ask, say "The quiz helps you self-diagnose, but I can discuss concepts")
- Overwhelm them with too much content (keep responses 2-3 sentences)
- Make them feel bad about low scores (frame as opportunities)
```

**Welcome Message:**
```
Hi! I'm here to help you interpret your pre-assessment results and plan your learning path for Week 1. How many questions did you answer correctly out of 7? Or if you have questions about specific concepts from the quiz, I'm happy to discuss them!

## Instructor Notes

**Module 0 Purpose:**
- Create cognitive dissonance (the $100M question challenges assumptions)
- Reveal knowledge gaps through AI roleplay and pre-assessment (Elements 2 + 4B-4H)
- Build motivation to learn Week 1 content
- AI Chat Widget (Element 4I) provides personalized learning path guidance
- Graphic novels provide visual entry point for diverse learners (UDL)

**Pre-Assessment Design Rationale (v3.0.0):**
- Reduced from 10 → 7 questions to minimize cognitive load before content begins
- Native Uplimit MC format provides immediate feedback (better than embedded widget)
- AI Chat Widget compensates for removing detailed results dashboard
- Each WLO tested by 2 questions for balanced diagnostic coverage

**Graphic Novel Notes:**
- Element 7 "Expansion Day" introduces the CFL anchor project (connects to Milestone 1 in Module 6)
- Element 8 "Five Streams" visualizes revenue concepts (connects to Nashville Predators case in Module 5)
- Both are optional but recommended for visual/narrative learners
