The Business of Sport: A Unique Revenue Ecosystem

Professional sport operates unlike any other industry. Teams compete on the field
but must collaborate financially to maintain competitive balance. Revenue streams
are interdependent—strong media rights deals fund player salaries, which attract
talent, which creates compelling content, which increases media value.

This week, we explore the five major revenue streams that power professional sport:
media rights, ticketing and attendance, sponsorship and partnerships, merchandising,
and the emerging betting/gaming sector. We'll examine not just how money flows IN,
but how it flows BETWEEN stakeholders through complex revenue sharing arrangements.

You'll learn why the NFL shares 60% of all revenue equally among teams, while
European soccer operates on a more entrepreneurial model. You'll understand why
the NBA invested billions in creating its own streaming infrastructure, and why
betting legalization fundamentally changes sport's economic equation.

### Element 3: Tiles Content
Create 4 tiles (2x2 grid):

**Tile 1 - Title:** "Media Rights"
**Tile 1 - Description:** "Broadcasting, streaming, and digital content deals. The largest revenue source for most leagues."

**Tile 2 - Title:** "Ticketing & Live Events"
**Tile 2 - Description:** "Gate receipts, premium seating, hospitality. Direct fan engagement and the gameday experience."

**Tile 3 - Title:** "Sponsorship & Partners"
**Tile 3 - Description:** "Corporate partnerships, naming rights, jersey sponsors. Brand alignment and activation."

**Tile 4 - Title:** "Emerging Streams"
**Tile 4 - Description:** "Betting integration, NFTs, metaverse experiences. Innovation at the revenue frontier."

**Design Rationale:**
- **ⓘ Infobox (Callout)** makes learning objectives visible (QM Standard 2, UDL engagement)
- **Text** provides narrative context (UDL representation)
- **◫ Tiles** create visual preview and chunking (UDL engagement, scannable overview)
- Students immediately understand week's scope and expectations
