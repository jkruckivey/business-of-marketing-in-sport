By the end of this week, you will:

**MLO 1.1: Map the major revenue streams in professional sport** (Bloom's: Understand)

**MLO 1.4: Analyze different revenue sharing models across leagues** (Bloom's: Analyze)
Compare revenue sharing approaches (NFL vs. NBA vs. European soccer) and determine how these models affect competitive balance and financial sustainability.

**This week focuses on CLO 1: Analyzing Revenue Ecosystems**

The Business of Sport: A Unique Revenue Ecosystem

Professional sport operates unlike any other industry. Teams compete on the field
but must collaborate financially to maintain competitive balance. Revenue streams
are interdependent‚Äîstrong media rights deals fund player salaries, which attract
talent, which creates compelling content, which increases media value.

This week, we explore the five major revenue streams that power professional sport:
media rights, ticketing and attendance, sponsorship and partnerships, merchandising,
and the emerging betting/gaming sector. We'll examine not just how money flows IN,
but how it flows BETWEEN stakeholders through complex revenue sharing arrangements.

You'll learn why the NFL shares 60% of all revenue equally among teams, while
European soccer operates on a more entrepreneurial model. You'll understand why
the NBA invested billions in creating its own streaming infrastructure, and why
betting legalization fundamentally changes sport's economic equation.
```

### Element 3: Tiles Content
Create 5 tiles:

**Tile 1 - Title:** "Media Rights"
**Tile 1 - Description:** "Broadcasting, streaming, and digital content deals. The largest revenue source for most leagues (40-60%)."

**Tile 2 - Title:** "Ticketing & Live Events"
**Tile 2 - Description:** "Gate receipts, premium seating, hospitality. Direct fan engagement and the gameday experience (20-30%)."

**Tile 3 - Title:** "Sponsorship & Partners"
**Tile 3 - Description:** "Corporate partnerships, naming rights, jersey sponsors. Brand alignment and activation (15-25%)."

**Tile 4 - Title:** "Merchandising"
**Tile 4 - Description:** "Apparel, licensed products, and brand extensions. Centralized models support competitive balance (5-10%)."

**Tile 5 - Title:** "Betting & Gaming"
**Tile 5 - Description:** "Sports betting partnerships and data licensing. The newest and fastest-growing frontier (2-8%, growing 30-40% annually)."

## Module 1 Complete - Transition to Module 2

**What You've Accomplished:**
You now know exactly where you're headed this week. You've seen the four learning objectives that will transform how you understand sports business, and you've been introduced to the five major revenue streams that power professional sport. You understand that this week focuses on analyzing revenue ecosystems‚Äîseeing sport as a unique business model where financial collaboration between competitors creates value.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Sport operates as an **interconnected revenue ecosystem**, not isolated revenue streams
- **Five major revenue streams** power professional sport: media rights (40-60%), ticketing (20-30%), sponsorship (15-25%), merchandising (5-10%), and betting (2-8%, growing 30-40%)
- Teams must **collaborate financially** to maintain competitive balance despite competing on the field
- Revenue sharing models vary dramatically: NFL shares 60% equally; European soccer operates entrepreneurially
- Strategic decisions trigger **cascading effects** across the entire revenue ecosystem

**Up Next: Module 2 - Executive Perspective**
Before diving into the technical details of each revenue stream, you'll hear from a senior sports business executive who has actually negotiated media deals, managed sponsorship portfolios, and built revenue strategies. They'll share the real-world challenges and strategic decisions that bring these concepts to life.

Ready to learn from someone who's done it? Let's hear the executive perspective.

## üéØ FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION

**How Module 1 Supports Your Final Strategic Vision:**

Module 1 established the four learning outcomes that define sports business strategy. This clarity of purpose directly supports your Week 5 capstone deliverable.

**What You Learned:**
- The five major revenue streams and their relative importance (media 40-60%, ticketing 20-30%, sponsorship 15-25%, merchandising 5-10%, betting 2-8%)
- Sport's unique collaborative competition model (teams compete on field, collaborate financially)
- Revenue sharing models vary by league (NFL 60%, NHL 50%, EPL tiered)

**How to Apply This to Your Final Project:**

When you create your 5-year strategic vision in Week 5, Module 1's frameworks provide your analytical foundation:

- **Revenue Model Section:** Use the 5-stream framework to structure your property's revenue analysis. Show percentage contribution from each stream and justify why your mix differs from league averages.
- **Competitive Context:** Explain how revenue sharing in your league/sport affects your property's strategic options. If you're in a high-sharing league (like NFL), justify why shared revenue limits your flexibility. If you're in a low-sharing environment (like soccer), explain your entrepreneurial advantages.
- **Growth Opportunities:** Reference MLO 1.3 to identify which revenue streams offer sustainable growth for YOUR property. Betting growing 30-40%? Media rights stagnating? Use this week's data to justify strategic priorities.

**Real-World Application:** Your strategic vision must answer: "How will this property make money over 5 years?" Module 1 taught you the universal framework every sports property uses to answer that question.
