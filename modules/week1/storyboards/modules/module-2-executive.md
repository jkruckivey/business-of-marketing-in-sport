Before diving into the details of each stream, you need context from someone who's actually done this work. In this module, you'll learn about the five major revenue streams through focused concept videos. These insights will ground the theory you're about to explore in Five Revenue Streams with real-world examples, strategic trade-offs, and industry context.

- Brief mention of interdependencies
- Sets up deeper exploration in Module 3

**FULL SCRIPT:**

```
[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]
[ON-SCREEN: Five revenue stream icons appearing]

NARRATOR:
Professional sports generates revenue from five major sources. Understanding these
streams is essential for analyzing sports business strategy.

Let's break them down quickly.

---

[SECTION: THE FIVE STREAMS - 0:15-1:45]
[ANIMATION: Each stream appears with percentage]

NARRATOR:
Stream #1: Media Rights (40-60% of revenue)
Broadcasting and streaming deals. The NFL's current media rights total $110 billion
over 11 years. This is the foundation of modern sports economics.

Stream #2: Ticketing & Live Events (20-30%)
Not just ticket sales—luxury suites, dynamic pricing, concessions, parking. Teams
generate $40-50 per attendee beyond the ticket price.

Stream #3: Sponsorship & Partnerships (15-25%)
Corporate deals like naming rights, jersey sponsors, and category partnerships.
Scotiabank Arena pays $30-50 million per year for naming rights.

Stream #4: Merchandising & Licensing (5-10%)
Jerseys, hats, video games. Often pooled and shared equally across teams to maintain
competitive balance.

Stream #5: Betting & Gaming (2-8%, growing fast)
The newest frontier. Leagues earn billions through betting partnerships, data licensing,
and media integration. Growing 30-40% year-over-year.

---

[CONCLUSION - 1:45-2:00]
[ANIMATION: Five streams connecting as ecosystem]

NARRATOR:
Key insight: These streams don't exist in isolation. They're interconnected.
Investment in one stream amplifies others.

Successful organizations build revenue ecosystems, not portfolios.

### Element 4: Video 2 - Revenue Sharing Models
- **File:** `week1-video2-revenue-sharing.mp4`
- **Duration:** 2 minutes
- **VTT Transcript:** `week1-video2-revenue-sharing.vtt` (required for accessibility)
- **Poster Image:** `week1-video2-poster.jpg` (thumbnail)
- **Video Title:** "Revenue Sharing Models Across Leagues"
- **Video Caption:** "2-minute comparison of NHL, NFL, and EPL revenue sharing approaches"

**Content Summary:**
- NHL model (50% of national media shared equally)
- NFL model (60% of all revenue shared)
- EPL model (more entrepreneurial, less sharing)
- Why revenue sharing maintains competitive balance
- Prepares for The Canucks Challenge case study

**FULL SCRIPT:**

```
[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]
[ANIMATION: Team logos circling around league shield]

NARRATOR:
Unlike most industries, professional sports leagues NEED their competitors to thrive. Why?

Because competitive balance creates a better product—and makes everyone more money.

This is the logic behind revenue sharing.

---

[SECTION: THREE MODELS - 0:15-1:45]
[ANIMATION: Three league models side-by-side]

NARRATOR:
Model #1: NFL—Maximum Socialism (60% shared)
Nearly all revenue is shared equally. Result? The Green Bay Packers—population 105,000—
generate similar revenue to the New York Giants. Highest competitive parity in sports.

Model #2: NHL—Moderate Sharing (50% shared)
National media rights, streaming, and merchandise are shared. Local media rights and
ticket sales stay with teams. Plus a revenue sharing pool for struggling teams.

The complication? Canadian teams earn in Canadian dollars but pay players in U.S. dollars.
Currency fluctuations create major challenges.

Model #3: Premier League—Tiered Distribution
TV revenue split three ways: 50% equal, 25% based on finishing position, 25% based on
TV appearances. Rewards success while maintaining baseline competitiveness.

---

[CONCLUSION - 1:45-2:00]
[ON-SCREEN: Key principle]

NARRATOR:
Why this matters: Revenue sharing limits strategic options, creates governance tensions,
and affects team valuations.

In the Vancouver Canucks case, you'll see how revenue sharing—and currency headwinds—
affect strategic decisions.

### Element 6: Video 4 - Stewart Johnston (CFL Commissioner) Interview ✅ AVAILABLE

**File:** `Interviews/Stewart Johnston_Captions_English (United States).txt` (with corresponding video)
**Duration:** ~18 minutes
**Transcript:** Available in Interviews folder
**Video Title:** "Stewart Johnston: Leading the CFL into Its Next Century"
**Video Caption:** "CFL Commissioner shares league-level revenue strategy, data-driven innovation, and expansion vision"

#### Interview Content - Key Topics Covered:

**Career Journey & Background (00:00-04:00)** - 27 years at TSN/Bell Media, led 3,600 employees across entertainment, news, sports, and ad sales. Left comfortable SVP role for commissioner position because "timing seemed right" and ownership group is strongest he's seen.

**Commissioner Role = CEO (04:00-08:00)** - "I'm not here to kiss babies and take pictures"—this is a CEO job focused on delivering growth to nine team owners. Daily work spans stakeholder relationships, communications, game operations, player associations, and commercial negotiations.

**Two Biggest Revenue Drivers (08:00-12:00)** - Media rights and commercial partnerships (sponsorships) are the two biggest league office revenue sources. Gate revenue critical for teams. Strategy: Make content so valuable it drives subscription and advertising dollars for partners.

**Balancing Heritage vs. Innovation (12:00-16:00)** - CFL has 110+ year legacy with passionate, long-tenured fans ("30-year season ticket holders"). Challenge: attract younger audiences without alienating core. Solution: "Relentless focus on entertainment" while protecting core Canadian football (3 downs, 12 players, wide field, unlimited motion).

**Data-Driven Rule Changes (14:00-18:00)** - Moved goalposts from middle of end zone to back. Asked game ops team to "run the data"—3 months of analysis projected 60 additional touchdowns per year. "We're not doing anything on a whim."

**Digital & Youth Strategy (18:00-22:00)** - Launching new CFL app and redesigned website (10-year-old platforms). Season-long fantasy game. "Drive to Survive" style content (CFL All Access). Flag football partnerships with provincial organizations. 2028 Olympics flag football with CFL players on Team Canada.

**Three Strategic Priorities (27:00-30:00)**:
1. **Relentless focus on entertainment** - Machine Gun Kelly halftime show drove 12-34 year old ratings spike
2. **Getting footballs into kids' hands** - Physical education partnerships, flag football grassroots
3. **Create nine profitable teams** - "We're not there yet"

**Expansion Vision (30:00-33:00)** - "If we haven't got a 10th team in Canada by ten years from now, I'll be disappointed." Multiple great markets across country could support expansion. Football is "having a moment."

**Gray Cup Success (throughout)** - 12% ratings increase for 2024 Gray Cup—"huge numbers relative to any other sport." Winnipeg model franchise: sold out every game, beautiful stadium, "really got something special going."

#### Viewing Guide for Students:
- **League vs. Franchise Revenue**: Compare Stewart's league-level view (media rights + partnerships) to Kevin Abrams' franchise-level view (salary cap, gate, sponsorship)
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: How Stewart used 3 months of data analysis to justify rule changes—evidence-based innovation
- **Heritage/Innovation Balance**: 110-year-old league making changes to attract younger audiences while respecting "30-year season ticket holders"
- **Commissioner as CEO**: Different accountability structure than franchise SVP—reporting to nine team owners
- **Expansion Strategy**: Not a top-3 priority but "incredibly important"—must build foundation first

#### Connection to Week 1 Themes:
- **Revenue Streams (WLO 1.1)**: Stewart names media rights and partnerships as top two league-level drivers
- **Unique Business Model (WLO 1.2)**: CFL's 9-team structure, scarcity of product (only 9 home games), heritage brand challenges
- **Revenue Sharing**: League office generates revenue distributed to teams; parallels NHL model from Video 2
- **Fan Engagement**: Digital strategy, fantasy sports, content creation—all tie to Week 2's streaming/engagement themes
