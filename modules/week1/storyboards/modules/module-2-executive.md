**FULL SCRIPT:**

```
[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]
[ON-SCREEN: Five revenue stream icons appearing]

NARRATOR:
Professional sports generates revenue from five major sources. Understanding these
streams is essential for analyzing sports business strategy.

Let's break them down quickly.

---

[SECTION: THE FIVE STREAMS - 0:15-1:45]
[ANIMATION: Each stream appears with percentage]

NARRATOR:
Stream #1: Media Rights (40-60% of revenue)
Broadcasting and streaming deals. The NFL's current media rights total $110 billion
over 11 years. This is the foundation of modern sports economics.

Stream #2: Ticketing & Live Events (20-30%)
Not just ticket sales—luxury suites, dynamic pricing, concessions, parking. Teams
generate $40-50 per attendee beyond the ticket price.

Stream #3: Sponsorship & Partnerships (15-25%)
Corporate deals like naming rights, jersey sponsors, and category partnerships.
Scotiabank Arena pays $30-50 million per year for naming rights.

Stream #4: Merchandising & Licensing (5-10%)
Jerseys, hats, video games. Often pooled and shared equally across teams to maintain
competitive balance.

Stream #5: Betting & Gaming (2-8%, growing fast)
The newest frontier. Leagues earn billions through betting partnerships, data licensing,
and media integration. Growing 30-40% year-over-year.

---

[CONCLUSION - 1:45-2:00]
[ANIMATION: Five streams connecting as ecosystem]

NARRATOR:
Key insight: These streams don't exist in isolation. They're interconnected.
Investment in one stream amplifies others.

Successful organizations build revenue ecosystems, not portfolios.

### Element 4: Video 2 - Revenue Sharing Models
- **File:** `week1-video2-revenue-sharing.mp4`
- **Duration:** 2 minutes
- **VTT Transcript:** `week1-video2-revenue-sharing.vtt` (required for accessibility)
- **Poster Image:** `week1-video2-poster.jpg` (thumbnail)
- **Video Title:** "Revenue Sharing Models Across Leagues"
- **Video Caption:** "2-minute comparison of NHL, NFL, and EPL revenue sharing approaches"

**Content Summary:**
- NHL model (50% of national media shared equally)
- NFL model (60% of all revenue shared)
- EPL model (more entrepreneurial, less sharing)
- Why revenue sharing maintains competitive balance
- Prepares for The Canucks Challenge case study

**FULL SCRIPT:**

```
[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]
[ANIMATION: Team logos circling around league shield]

NARRATOR:
Unlike most industries, professional sports leagues NEED their competitors to thrive. Why?

Because competitive balance creates a better product—and makes everyone more money.

This is the logic behind revenue sharing.

---

[SECTION: THREE MODELS - 0:15-1:45]
[ANIMATION: Three league models side-by-side]

NARRATOR:
Model #1: NFL—Maximum Socialism (60% shared)
Nearly all revenue is shared equally. Result? The Green Bay Packers—population 105,000—
generate similar revenue to the New York Giants. Highest competitive parity in sports.

Model #2: NHL—Moderate Sharing (50% shared)
National media rights, streaming, and merchandise are shared. Local media rights and
ticket sales stay with teams. Plus a revenue sharing pool for struggling teams.

The complication? Canadian teams earn in Canadian dollars but pay players in U.S. dollars.
Currency fluctuations create major challenges.

Model #3: Premier League—Tiered Distribution
TV revenue split three ways: 50% equal, 25% based on finishing position, 25% based on
TV appearances. Rewards success while maintaining baseline competitiveness.

---

[CONCLUSION - 1:45-2:00]
[ON-SCREEN: Key principle]

NARRATOR:
Why this matters: Revenue sharing limits strategic options, creates governance tensions,
and affects team valuations.

In the Vancouver Canucks case, you'll see how revenue sharing—and currency headwinds—
affect strategic decisions.
