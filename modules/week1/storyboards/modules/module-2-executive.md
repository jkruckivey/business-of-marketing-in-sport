---

**Question 1: Salary Cap Evolution**

**Question:**
```
Kevin describes how the Giants' approach to salary cap management has evolved. What metaphor does he use to describe their current approach?
```

**Options:**
- A: Checking account (track expenses in/out)
- B: Investment portfolio (manage assets for returns) ✅
- C: Spreadsheet (optimize numbers)
- D: Budget committee (annual planning cycle)

**After Submission:**
```
Salary cap management has evolved from simple expense tracking to sophisticated investment thinking. Understanding this evolution helps explain how successful franchises maximize player value.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Correct! Kevin describes evolving from a "checking account" mentality to a "portfolio" approach where salary cap dollars are viewed as investments requiring consensus building across stakeholders with different time horizons (coaches vs. GMs).
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Kevin specifically contrasts their old approach with their current method. Listen for how he describes the evolution—the new approach involves thinking about cap dollars as assets that require investment committee-style consensus building.
```

**Points:** 1 | **Shuffle options:** Yes

---

**Question 2: AI Implementation**

**Question:**
```
According to Kevin, what determines the quality of output from their enterprise ChatGPT implementation?
```

**Options:**
- A: The processing power of the system
- B: The amount of training data available
- C: The quality of prompts users create ✅
- D: The number of employees using it

**After Submission:**
```
AI implementation success depends heavily on how users interact with the technology. This principle applies across industries adopting generative AI tools.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Correct! Kevin emphasizes that "quality of prompts dictates output" when discussing their AI rollout. This principle applies broadly: AI tools are only as useful as the questions and instructions given to them. The Giants are learning prompt engineering across departments.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Kevin discusses their enterprise AI rollout and mentions a specific factor that determines success. It's not about the technology itself—it's about how employees interact with it. Think about what input users provide.
```

**Points:** 1 | **Shuffle options:** Yes

---

**Question 3: Business-Football Integration**

**Question:**
```
Kevin mentions that heavyweight sponsors like Moody's and MetLife serve a function beyond just paying for naming rights. What additional value do they provide?
```

**Options:**
- A: They recruit talent from their companies to work for the Giants
- B: They serve as an advisory board for facility planning and business decisions ✅
- C: They provide free financial services to players
- D: They handle all stadium construction contracts

**After Submission:**
```
Corporate sponsors often bring expertise beyond their financial contributions. Understanding these hidden value exchanges reveals why certain partnerships succeed while others remain transactional.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Correct! Kevin explains that sponsors like Moody's (analytics/financial expertise) and MetLife (risk management) serve as informal advisors on facility planning and business strategy. It's a win-win: the Giants get expert consultation, and sponsors gain deeper integration with the organization.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Kevin describes an unexpected benefit from their corporate sponsors. Beyond the money, these Fortune 500 companies bring expertise in their fields. Think about what a financial analytics firm or insurance giant could advise on.
```

**Points:** 1 | **Shuffle options:** Yes

---

**Question 4: Career Path Insight**

**Question:**
```
Based on Kevin's career journey from Canada to NY Giants leadership, what factor does he emphasize as critical for breaking into sports business?
```

Breaking into sports business often requires different strategies than traditional corporate careers. Understanding what successful executives actually did reveals more actionable advice than conventional wisdom.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```

He emphasizes knowing your "geographic and financial flexibility"—being willing to relocate and accept lower initial pay. He also advises saying yes to everything early in your career and doing research before meetings.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Kevin shares his career advice based on completing multiple internships before his first full-time position. He emphasizes practical considerations about what you're willing to sacrifice early in your career to get your foot in the door.
```

**Points:** 1 | **Shuffle options:** Yes

---

**Question 5: NIL Era Impact**

```
How does Kevin describe the Giants' approach to player branding in the NIL (Name, Image, Likeness) era?
```

**Options:**
- A: They prohibit players from pursuing outside brand deals
- B: They help connect players to corporate partners, creating win-win-win outcomes ✅
- C: They require players to share all NIL revenue with the team

The NIL era has fundamentally changed how teams interact with player brands. Organizations that adapt their approach can create mutual value rather than viewing player marketing as a distraction.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Correct! Kevin describes a "win-win-win" approach: players earn more, sponsors get authentic athlete partnerships, and the team benefits from reduced off-field distractions and increased organizational integration. Players now arrive as established brands from college NIL experience.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
