## From Frameworks to Practice

You now understand where you're headed this week—the four learning outcomes that will transform how you analyze sports business. You've been introduced to the five major revenue streams and seen why they operate as an interconnected ecosystem rather than independent channels.

Before diving into the details of each stream, you need context from leaders who've actually done this work. In this module, you'll hear from two executives with very different perspectives:

**Kevin Abrams, SVP Football Operations & Strategy, NY Giants (~32 min)** — Inside a $10 billion NFL franchise. His insights on salary cap management, AI implementation, and business-football integration will ground the theory you're about to explore.

**Stewart Johnston, Commissioner, Canadian Football League (~35 min)** — Leading a league through transformation. His vision for CFL expansion, balancing tradition with innovation, and media rights strategy will directly inform your Anchor Project throughout this course.

Pay attention to how these leaders think about revenue streams, strategic priorities, and growth—you'll apply their frameworks throughout this course.

2. Configure as ungraded self-assessment
3. Add the following 5 multiple choice questions:

---

**Question 1: Salary Cap Evolution**

**Question:**
```
Kevin describes how the Giants' approach to salary cap management has evolved. What metaphor does he use to describe their current approach?
```

**Options:**
- A: Checking account (track expenses in/out)
- B: Investment portfolio (manage assets for returns) ✅
- C: Spreadsheet (optimize numbers)
- D: Budget committee (annual planning cycle)

**After Submission:**
```
Salary cap management has evolved from simple expense tracking to sophisticated investment thinking. Understanding this evolution helps explain how successful franchises maximize player value.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Correct! Kevin describes evolving from a "checking account" mentality to a "portfolio" approach where salary cap dollars are viewed as investments requiring consensus building across stakeholders with different time horizons (coaches vs. GMs).
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Kevin specifically contrasts their old approach with their current method. Listen for how he describes the evolution—the new approach involves thinking about cap dollars as assets that require investment committee-style consensus building.
```

**Points:** 1 | **Shuffle options:** Yes

---

**Question 2: AI Implementation**

**Question:**
```
According to Kevin, what determines the quality of output from their enterprise ChatGPT implementation?
```

**Options:**
- A: The processing power of the system
- B: The amount of training data available
- C: The quality of prompts users create ✅
- D: The number of employees using it

**After Submission:**
```
AI implementation success depends heavily on how users interact with the technology. This principle applies across industries adopting generative AI tools.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Correct! Kevin emphasizes that "quality of prompts dictates output" when discussing their AI rollout. This principle applies broadly: AI tools are only as useful as the questions and instructions given to them. The Giants are learning prompt engineering across departments.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Kevin discusses their enterprise AI rollout and mentions a specific factor that determines success. It's not about the technology itself—it's about how employees interact with it. Think about what input users provide.
```

**Points:** 1 | **Shuffle options:** Yes

---

**Question 3: Business-Football Integration**

**Question:**
```
Kevin mentions that heavyweight sponsors like Moody's and MetLife serve a function beyond just paying for naming rights. What additional value do they provide?
```

**Options:**
- A: They recruit talent from their companies to work for the Giants
- B: They serve as an advisory board for facility planning and business decisions ✅
- C: They provide free financial services to players
- D: They handle all stadium construction contracts

**After Submission:**
```
Corporate sponsors often bring expertise beyond their financial contributions. Understanding these hidden value exchanges reveals why certain partnerships succeed while others remain transactional.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Correct! Kevin explains that sponsors like Moody's (analytics/financial expertise) and MetLife (risk management) serve as informal advisors on facility planning and business strategy. It's a win-win: the Giants get expert consultation, and sponsors gain deeper integration with the organization.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Kevin describes an unexpected benefit from their corporate sponsors. Beyond the money, these Fortune 500 companies bring expertise in their fields. Think about what a financial analytics firm or insurance giant could advise on.
```

**Points:** 1 | **Shuffle options:** Yes

---

**Question 4: Career Path Insight**

**Question:**
```
Based on Kevin's career journey from Canada to NY Giants leadership, what factor does he emphasize as critical for breaking into sports business?
```

**Options:**
- A: Having an MBA from a top business school
- B: Geographic and financial flexibility in early career ✅
- C: Family connections to team ownership
- D: Previous professional athletic experience

**After Submission:**
```
Breaking into sports business often requires different strategies than traditional corporate careers. Understanding what successful executives actually did reveals more actionable advice than conventional wisdom.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Correct! Kevin completed 6-7 internships before landing his first full-time role. He emphasizes knowing your "geographic and financial flexibility"—being willing to relocate and accept lower initial pay. He also advises saying yes to everything early in your career and doing research before meetings.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Kevin shares his career advice based on completing multiple internships before his first full-time position. He emphasizes practical considerations about what you're willing to sacrifice early in your career to get your foot in the door.
```

**Points:** 1 | **Shuffle options:** Yes

---

**Question 5: NIL Era Impact**

**Question:**
```
How does Kevin describe the Giants' approach to player branding in the NIL (Name, Image, Likeness) era?
```

**Options:**
- A: They prohibit players from pursuing outside brand deals
- B: They help connect players to corporate partners, creating win-win-win outcomes ✅
- C: They require players to share all NIL revenue with the team
- D: They discourage player marketing to minimize distractions

**After Submission:**
```
The NIL era has fundamentally changed how teams interact with player brands. Organizations that adapt their approach can create mutual value rather than viewing player marketing as a distraction.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Correct! Kevin describes a "win-win-win" approach: players earn more, sponsors get authentic athlete partnerships, and the team benefits from reduced off-field distractions and increased organizational integration. Players now arrive as established brands from college NIL experience.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Kevin describes the NIL era positively and explains how the Giants work with it rather than against it. Think about how connecting players with the team's existing corporate partners (like Moody's, MetLife) could benefit everyone involved.

3. Set as "Practice Quiz" (not graded) for self-assessment

---

#### Question 1: Commissioner Role

Stewart explicitly describes his commissioner role as what type of position?

A) A ceremonial figurehead role
B) A CEO position with real accountability ✅
C) A mediator between team owners
D) A public relations spokesperson

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Stewart emphasizes: "This is a CEO job." He's accountable to nine team owners who expect growth and profitability, not just someone who "kisses babies and takes pictures."

---

#### Question 2: League Revenue Drivers

According to Stewart, what are the TWO biggest revenue drivers at the CFL league office?

B) Media rights and commercial sponsorships ✅
C) Broadcasting fees and player transfers
D) Licensing deals and stadium operations

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Stewart states: "The two biggest drivers of revenue at the league office are within the media rights and commercial partnerships with sponsors." Gate revenue goes to individual teams, not the league.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Review Stewart's discussion of league-level revenue. He emphasizes that media rights and commercial partnerships (sponsorships) are his primary focus as commissioner.

---

#### Question 3: Strategic Priorities

Stewart identifies three strategic priorities for the CFL. Which is NOT one of his top three priorities?

A) Relentless focus on entertainment
B) Getting footballs into kids' hands (youth engagement)
C) Creating nine profitable teams
D) Expanding to a 10th team ✅

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Stewart explicitly states that expansion is NOT in his top 3 priorities, even though he expects a 10th team within 10 years. His priorities are: (1) entertainment, (2) youth engagement, and (3) nine profitable teams.

---

A) They're primarily young, tech-savvy viewers
B) They're 30-40 year season ticket holders who are passionately loyal ✅
C) They're casual viewers who tune in occasionally
D) They're primarily international audiences

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Stewart describes the challenge of serving loyal 30-40 year season ticket holders who are "absolutely passionate" while also growing new audiences. This creates a tradition vs. innovation tension.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Stewart specifically mentions that the CFL's core fans are long-term (30-40 year) season ticket holders. This creates a strategic challenge: how to grow new audiences without alienating passionate traditionalists.

---

#### Question 5: Expansion Timeline

What is Stewart's expectation for CFL expansion?

A) No expansion is planned
B) 10th team within 10 years ✅

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Stewart discusses a realistic timeline for expansion. He's not rushing it (not top 3 priority), but he expects the league to have a 10th team within the next decade.

---

#### Question 6: Anchor Project Application

Based on Stewart's interview, which factor is MOST important when evaluating a CFL expansion market?

A) The city's population size alone
B) Alignment with the three strategic priorities (entertainment, youth, profitability) ✅
C) Proximity to existing CFL teams
D) The number of hockey fans in the market

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Your CFL expansion proposal should demonstrate how your market enhances entertainment value, grows youth engagement, and can be profitable. Stewart's three priorities become your evaluation criteria.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Stewart's three priorities (entertainment, youth engagement, profitability) should guide expansion decisions. A great market is one where the expansion team advances these priorities, not just one with a large population.
