**FULL SCRIPT:**

```
[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]
[ON-SCREEN: Five revenue stream icons appearing]

NARRATOR:
Professional sports generates revenue from five major sources. Understanding these
streams is essential for analyzing sports business strategy.

Let's break them down quickly.

---

[SECTION: THE FIVE STREAMS - 0:15-1:45]
[ANIMATION: Each stream appears with percentage]

NARRATOR:
Stream #1: Media Rights (40-60% of revenue)
Broadcasting and streaming deals. The NFL's current media rights total $110 billion
over 11 years. This is the foundation of modern sports economics.

Stream #2: Ticketing & Live Events (20-30%)
Not just ticket sales—luxury suites, dynamic pricing, concessions, parking. Teams
generate $40-50 per attendee beyond the ticket price.

Stream #3: Sponsorship & Partnerships (15-25%)
Corporate deals like naming rights, jersey sponsors, and category partnerships.
Scotiabank Arena pays $30-50 million per year for naming rights.

Stream #4: Merchandising & Licensing (5-10%)
Jerseys, hats, video games. Often pooled and shared equally across teams to maintain
competitive balance.

Stream #5: Betting & Gaming (2-8%, growing fast)
The newest frontier. Leagues earn billions through betting partnerships, data licensing,
and media integration. Growing 30-40% year-over-year.

---

[CONCLUSION - 1:45-2:00]
[ANIMATION: Five streams connecting as ecosystem]

NARRATOR:
Key insight: These streams don't exist in isolation. They're interconnected.
Investment in one stream amplifies others.

Successful organizations build revenue ecosystems, not portfolios.

### Element 4: Video 2 - Revenue Sharing Models
- **File:** `week1-video2-revenue-sharing.mp4`
- **Duration:** 2 minutes
- **VTT Transcript:** `week1-video2-revenue-sharing.vtt` (required for accessibility)
- **Poster Image:** `week1-video2-poster.jpg` (thumbnail)
- **Video Title:** "Revenue Sharing Models Across Leagues"
- **Video Caption:** "2-minute comparison of NHL, NFL, and EPL revenue sharing approaches"

**Content Summary:**
- NHL model (50% of national media shared equally)
- NFL model (60% of all revenue shared)
- EPL model (more entrepreneurial, less sharing)
- Why revenue sharing maintains competitive balance
- Prepares for The Predators Problem case study

**FULL SCRIPT:**

```
[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]
[ANIMATION: Team logos circling around league shield]

NARRATOR:
Unlike most industries, professional sports leagues NEED their competitors to thrive. Why?

Because competitive balance creates a better product—and makes everyone more money.

This is the logic behind revenue sharing.

---

[SECTION: THREE MODELS - 0:15-1:45]
[ANIMATION: Three league models side-by-side]

NARRATOR:
Model #1: NFL—Maximum Socialism (60% shared)
Nearly all revenue is shared equally. Result? The Green Bay Packers—population 105,000—
generate similar revenue to the New York Giants. Highest competitive parity in sports.

Model #2: NHL—Moderate Sharing (50% shared)
National media rights, streaming, and merchandise are shared. Local media rights and
ticket sales stay with teams. Plus a revenue sharing pool for struggling teams.

The complication? Canadian teams earn in Canadian dollars but pay players in U.S. dollars.
Currency fluctuations create major challenges.

Model #3: Premier League—Tiered Distribution
TV revenue split three ways: 50% equal, 25% based on finishing position, 25% based on
TV appearances. Rewards success while maintaining baseline competitiveness.

---

[CONCLUSION - 1:45-2:00]
[ON-SCREEN: Key principle]

NARRATOR:
Why this matters: Revenue sharing limits strategic options, creates governance tensions,
and affects team valuations.

In the Nashville Predators case, you'll see how market feasibility and marketing strategy
affect decisions about franchise success and potential relocation.

### Element 4A: Practice Quiz - Revenue Concepts Check

**Uplift Implementation:**
1. Select **Exercise - Practice Quiz** element
2. Configure as ungraded self-assessment
3. Add the following 4 multiple choice questions:

---

### Question 1: Largest Revenue Stream

Based on Video 1, which revenue stream generates the LARGEST percentage of revenue for most professional sports organizations?

A) Ticketing & Live Events (20-30%)
B) Media Rights (40-60%) ✅
C) Sponsorship & Partnerships (15-25%)
D) Betting & Gaming (2-8%)

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Media rights represent 40-60% of total revenue for most major leagues. The NFL's current media deal totals $110 billion over 11 years, demonstrating why broadcasting and streaming rights form the foundation of modern sports economics.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Review Video 1's breakdown of revenue percentages. While all five streams are important, one stream dominates at 40-60% of total revenue—it's the foundation of modern sports economics and involves broadcasting and streaming deals.

---

### Question 2: Revenue Ecosystem Concept

The video emphasizes that revenue streams don't exist in isolation—they function as an "interconnected ecosystem." What does this mean for sports business strategy?

A) Teams should focus on maximizing one revenue stream at a time
B) Investment in one stream can amplify revenue from other streams ✅
C) Revenue streams compete against each other for fan attention
D) Smaller teams should ignore certain revenue streams entirely

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! The ecosystem concept means revenue streams reinforce each other. For example, strong media presence drives sponsorship value, which increases exposure, which attracts betting partnerships, which creates content for media. Successful organizations build these connections intentionally.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** The key insight from Video 1 is that successful organizations build revenue "ecosystems, not portfolios." Think about how investment in media presence might affect sponsorship attractiveness, or how live event experience might drive merchandise sales.

---

### Question 3: Revenue Sharing Models

According to Video 2, which league has the HIGHEST level of revenue sharing, creating the greatest competitive parity?

A) English Premier League (tiered distribution)
B) NHL (50% shared)
C) NFL (60% shared) ✅
D) All leagues share revenue equally

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! The NFL shares nearly 60% of all revenue equally among teams. This "maximum socialism" approach explains why the Green Bay Packers (population 105,000) can generate similar revenue to the New York Giants. It creates the highest competitive parity in professional sports.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Review Video 2's comparison of the three models. One league is described as practicing "maximum socialism" with the result that a small-market team like Green Bay can compete financially with New York.

---

### Question 4: Canadian NHL Challenge

Video 2 mentions a specific challenge facing Canadian NHL teams. What creates this financial complication?

A) Lower ticket prices in Canadian markets
B) Earning revenue in Canadian dollars but paying players in U.S. dollars ✅
C) Smaller national media contracts in Canada
D) Higher arena operating costs due to weather

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Canadian teams face currency risk because they earn significant revenue in Canadian dollars (ticket sales, local sponsorships) but must pay player salaries in U.S. dollars as required by the NHL CBA. When the Canadian dollar weakens, their effective costs increase substantially.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** The video specifically mentions a complication related to currency that creates "major challenges" for Canadian teams. Think about what currency players are paid in versus what currency Canadian fans use.

### Element 5A: Practice Quiz - Kevin Abrams Interview Check

**Uplift Implementation:**
1. Select **Exercise - Practice Quiz** element
2. Configure as ungraded self-assessment
3. Add the following 5 multiple choice questions:

---

### Question 1: Salary Cap Evolution

Kevin describes how the Giants' approach to salary cap management has evolved. What metaphor does he use to describe their current approach?

A) Checking account (track expenses in/out)
B) Investment portfolio (manage assets for returns) ✅
C) Spreadsheet (optimize numbers)
D) Budget committee (annual planning cycle)

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Kevin describes evolving from a "checking account" mentality (simple expense tracking) to a "portfolio" approach where salary cap dollars are viewed as investments requiring consensus building across stakeholders with different time horizons (coaches vs. GMs).

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Kevin specifically contrasts their old approach with their current, more sophisticated method. Listen for how he describes the evolution—the new approach involves thinking about cap dollars as assets that require investment committee-style consensus building.

---

### Question 2: AI Implementation

According to Kevin, what determines the quality of output from their enterprise ChatGPT implementation?

A) The processing power of the system
B) The amount of training data available
C) The quality of prompts users create ✅
D) The number of employees using it

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Kevin emphasizes that "quality of prompts dictates output" when discussing their AI rollout. This principle applies broadly: AI tools are only as useful as the questions and instructions given to them. The Giants are learning prompt engineering across departments.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Kevin discusses their enterprise AI rollout and mentions a specific factor that determines success. It's not about the technology itself—it's about how employees interact with it. Think about what input users provide.

---

### Question 3: Business-Football Integration

Kevin mentions that heavyweight sponsors like Moody's and MetLife serve a function beyond just paying for naming rights. What additional value do they provide?

A) They recruit talent from their companies to work for the Giants
B) They serve as an advisory board for facility planning and business decisions ✅
C) They provide free financial services to players
D) They handle all stadium construction contracts

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Kevin explains that sponsors like Moody's (analytics/financial expertise) and MetLife (risk management) serve as informal advisors on facility planning and business strategy. It's a win-win: the Giants get expert consultation, and sponsors gain deeper integration with the organization.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Kevin describes an unexpected benefit from their corporate sponsors. Beyond the money, these Fortune 500 companies bring expertise in their fields. Think about what a financial analytics firm or insurance giant could advise on.

---

### Question 4: Career Path Insight

Based on Kevin's career journey from Canada to NY Giants leadership, what factor does he emphasize as critical for breaking into sports business?

A) Having an MBA from a top business school
B) Geographic and financial flexibility in early career ✅
C) Family connections to team ownership
D) Previous professional athletic experience

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Kevin completed 6-7 internships before landing his first full-time role. He emphasizes knowing your "geographic and financial flexibility"—being willing to relocate and accept lower initial pay. He also advises saying yes to everything early in your career and doing research before meetings.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Kevin shares his career advice based on completing multiple internships before his first full-time position. He emphasizes practical considerations about what you're willing to sacrifice early in your career to get your foot in the door.

---

### Question 5: NIL Era Impact

How does Kevin describe the Giants' approach to player branding in the NIL (Name, Image, Likeness) era?

A) They prohibit players from pursuing outside brand deals
B) They help connect players to corporate partners, creating win-win-win outcomes ✅
C) They require players to share all NIL revenue with the team
D) They discourage player marketing to minimize distractions

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Kevin describes a "win-win-win" approach: players earn more, sponsors get authentic athlete partnerships, and the team benefits from reduced off-field distractions and increased organizational integration. Players now arrive as established brands from college NIL experience.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Kevin describes the NIL era positively and explains how the Giants work with it rather than against it. Think about how connecting players with the team's existing corporate partners (like Moody's, MetLife) could benefit everyone involved.
