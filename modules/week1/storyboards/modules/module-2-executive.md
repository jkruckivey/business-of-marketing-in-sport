### Element 1: Connecting Introduction Text
**Copy this markdown directly into Uplimit:**

```markdown
You now understand where you're headed this week—the four learning objectives that will transform how you analyze sports business. You've been introduced to the five major revenue streams and seen why they operate as an interconnected ecosystem rather than independent channels.

Before diving into the details of each stream, you need context from someone who's actually done this work. In this module, you'll hear from a senior sports business executive who has negotiated multi-million dollar media deals, built sponsorship portfolios, and navigated the complex economics of Canadian sports markets. Their insights will ground the theory you're about to explore in Module 3 with real-world experience, strategic trade-offs, and lessons learned from the field.

**FULL SCRIPT:**

```
[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]
[ON-SCREEN: Five revenue stream icons appearing]

NARRATOR:
Professional sports generates revenue from five major sources. Understanding these
streams is essential for analyzing sports business strategy.

Let's break them down quickly.

---

[SECTION: THE FIVE STREAMS - 0:15-1:45]
[ANIMATION: Each stream appears with percentage]

NARRATOR:
Stream #1: Media Rights (40-60% of revenue)
Broadcasting and streaming deals. The NFL's current media rights total $110 billion
over 11 years. This is the foundation of modern sports economics.

Stream #2: Ticketing & Live Events (20-30%)
Not just ticket sales—luxury suites, dynamic pricing, concessions, parking. Teams
generate $40-50 per attendee beyond the ticket price.

Stream #3: Sponsorship & Partnerships (15-25%)
Corporate deals like naming rights, jersey sponsors, and category partnerships.
Scotiabank Arena pays $30-50 million per year for naming rights.

Stream #4: Merchandising & Licensing (5-10%)
Jerseys, hats, video games. Often pooled and shared equally across teams to maintain
competitive balance.

Stream #5: Betting & Gaming (2-8%, growing fast)
The newest frontier. Leagues earn billions through betting partnerships, data licensing,
and media integration. Growing 30-40% year-over-year.

---

[CONCLUSION - 1:45-2:00]
[ANIMATION: Five streams connecting as ecosystem]

NARRATOR:
Key insight: These streams don't exist in isolation. They're interconnected.
Investment in one stream amplifies others.

Successful organizations build revenue ecosystems, not portfolios.

### Element 5: Video 2 - Revenue Sharing Models
- **File:** `week1-video2-revenue-sharing.mp4`
- **Duration:** 2 minutes
- **VTT Transcript:** `week1-video2-revenue-sharing.vtt` (required for accessibility)
- **Poster Image:** `week1-video2-poster.jpg` (thumbnail)
- **Video Title:** "Revenue Sharing Models Across Leagues"
- **Video Caption:** "2-minute comparison of NHL, NFL, and EPL revenue sharing approaches"

**Content Summary:**
- NHL model (50% of national media shared equally)
- NFL model (60% of all revenue shared)
- EPL model (more entrepreneurial, less sharing)
- Why revenue sharing maintains competitive balance
- Prepares for Module 5 Canucks case

**FULL SCRIPT:**

```
[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]
[ANIMATION: Team logos circling around league shield]

NARRATOR:
Unlike most industries, professional sports leagues NEED their competitors to thrive. Why?

Because competitive balance creates a better product—and makes everyone more money.

This is the logic behind revenue sharing.

---

[SECTION: THREE MODELS - 0:15-1:45]
[ANIMATION: Three league models side-by-side]

NARRATOR:
Model #1: NFL—Maximum Socialism (60% shared)
Nearly all revenue is shared equally. Result? The Green Bay Packers—population 105,000—
generate similar revenue to the New York Giants. Highest competitive parity in sports.

Model #2: NHL—Moderate Sharing (50% shared)
National media rights, streaming, and merchandise are shared. Local media rights and
ticket sales stay with teams. Plus a revenue sharing pool for struggling teams.

The complication? Canadian teams earn in Canadian dollars but pay players in U.S. dollars.
Currency fluctuations create major challenges.

Model #3: Premier League—Tiered Distribution
TV revenue split three ways: 50% equal, 25% based on finishing position, 25% based on
TV appearances. Rewards success while maintaining baseline competitiveness.

---

[CONCLUSION - 1:45-2:00]
[ON-SCREEN: Key principle]

NARRATOR:
Why this matters: Revenue sharing limits strategic options, creates governance tensions,
and affects team valuations.

In the Vancouver Canucks case, you'll see how revenue sharing—and currency headwinds—
affect strategic decisions.

## 🎯 FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION

**How Module 2 Supports Your Final Strategic Vision:**

Module 2 delivered authentic practitioner insights from executives who negotiate media deals and build revenue strategies. This real-world perspective grounds your Week 5 strategic vision in operational reality.

**What You Learned:**
- Media rights (40-60%) dominate modern sports economics—executives prioritize this revenue stream above all others
- Revenue sharing creates governance tensions and limits strategic flexibility (Canadian teams face currency headwinds)
- Real-world media deals involve complex trade-offs: exclusivity vs. reach, guaranteed fees vs. revenue share, linear broadcast vs. streaming

**How to Apply This to Your Final Project:**

When you craft your strategic vision in Week 5, reference executive decision-making frameworks from Module 2:

- **Media Rights Strategy:** Cite the executive interview insights when explaining your media approach. Example: "Following TSN's model of balancing linear broadcast (reach) with streaming (data/engagement), our property will..."
- **Strategic Constraints:** Acknowledge real-world limitations executives face. If your property is in a revenue-sharing league, explain how this constrains your options (like Canadian NHL teams dealing with currency risk).
- **Stakeholder Management:** Executives must justify decisions to boards, owners, and partners. Your strategic vision should anticipate skeptical questions and pre-emptively address them with data.

**Real-World Application:** The Bell Media/TSN executive shared how they evaluate partnership opportunities and navigate league politics. When you pitch your 5-year vision, you'll face similar scrutiny from skeptical stakeholders. Module 2 taught you how practitioners defend strategic choices.
