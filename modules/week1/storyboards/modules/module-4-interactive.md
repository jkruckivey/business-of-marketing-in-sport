# Interactive Activity: Revenue Ecosystem Challenge

You've explored each revenue stream through interactive simulations in Module 3. Now it's time to experience how these streams work together as an ecosystem—where decisions in one area create ripple effects across all others.

## Your Challenge

As the newly hired Chief Revenue Officer, you'll have a conversation with Patricia Chen, your Board Chair. She'll present strategic scenarios, and you'll make decisions and explain your reasoning. Over the simulated 5-year period, you'll face decisions like:

- **Investment Philosophy:** Will you chase high-growth streams (betting, merchandise) or build foundation streams (ticketing, media)?
- **Crisis Response:** When market conditions change, will you cut costs or double down on your strategy?
- **Strategic Pivots:** How will you adjust based on what you learn about ecosystem dynamics?

Each choice has consequences that ripple through your revenue ecosystem. Patricia will share results after each decision, so you can see how your choices affected all five streams—not just the ones you invested in.

## What You'll Learn

- **Ecosystem dynamics:** How investment in one stream affects all others
- **Cascade effects:** Why "foundation" streams (ticketing, media) can outperform "growth" streams (betting)
- **Risk management:** How to respond when market conditions change unexpectedly
- **Strategic trade-offs:** Why there's no single "correct" strategy—only defensible ones

## Key Concepts to Apply

Before you start, remember these insights from Module 3:

- **Cascade Effects:** Engaged fans in the arena buy more merchandise, watch more broadcasts, and bet more on games. Investment in ticketing creates ripple effects across all streams.
- **Growth vs. Stability:** Betting/gaming offers 30-40% annual growth but lacks ecosystem effects. Ticketing grows slowly (5-8%) but amplifies everything else.
- **Recession Response:** Counter-cyclical investment (spending when competitors cut) can create competitive advantage—but requires courage and resources.

## How It Works

1. **Patricia presents a scenario** with options to consider
2. **Make your choice AND explain your reasoning** — this is graded, so don't just pick an option
3. **Observe the consequences** Patricia shares after each decision
4. **Learn from the outcomes** — pay attention to which streams grew even without direct investment
5. **Complete the conversation** through all decision points

## After the Roleplay

Once you complete the Revenue Ecosystem Challenge, you'll write a Strategic Decision Analysis (750-1000 words) reflecting on your choices. The analysis will be evaluated on:
- Strategic reasoning (10 pts)
- Ecosystem understanding (10 pts)
- Critical reflection (5 pts)
- Business communication (5 pts)

**Ready?** Start the conversation with Patricia Chen below and begin your 5-year journey as CRO.

### Element 3: AI Roleplay - Revenue Ecosystem Challenge `[v2.1.0]`

**Scenario Title:** Revenue Ecosystem Challenge

**Purpose:** Students experience revenue ecosystem dynamics through a simulated 5-year tenure as Chief Revenue Officer. The AI presents strategic scenarios and probes their reasoning, teaching cascade effects through consequences of their decisions.

---

#### Uplimit AI Roleplay Configuration

**Tab 1: Learning Outcome**

**Widget Name:** Revenue Ecosystem Challenge

**Learning Outcome:**
```
Students will demonstrate understanding of revenue ecosystem dynamics by making strategic decisions as CRO of an NHL expansion team. Through 3-4 decision scenarios, students will:

1. Apply ecosystem thinking to investment decisions (growth streams vs foundation streams)
2. Experience cascade effects where decisions in one stream impact all others
3. Navigate market uncertainty (recession response, regulatory changes)
4. Articulate strategic reasoning for their choices

Success = Student completes the roleplay having experienced how foundation investments (ticketing, media) create ripple effects across all streams, while high-growth investments (betting) may not amplify the ecosystem.
```

**Scenario Setup:** Experiential simulation (application-level learning)

---

**Tab 2: Scenario**

**Context:**
```
The learner has just been hired as Chief Revenue Officer of a mid-market NHL expansion team. The owners have set a clear mandate: grow annual revenue from $100M to $200M within 5 years. The team currently generates revenue from five streams: Media Rights ($40M), Ticketing ($25M), Sponsorship ($20M), Merchandise ($10M), and Betting/Gaming ($5M). The learner will face 3-4 strategic decisions over the simulated 5-year period, with each choice creating consequences that ripple through the revenue ecosystem.
```

**Role of AI (Board Chair):**
```
Patricia Chen, Chair of the Board of Directors. Former Fortune 500 CEO with experience in media and entertainment. She presents strategic scenarios, asks probing questions about the learner's reasoning, and delivers consequences of their decisions. She is supportive but challenges assumptions.
```

**Role of Student:**
```
The learner plays the Chief Revenue Officer making strategic decisions about revenue investment, responding to market changes, and defending their choices to the Board Chair.
```

---

**Tab 3: Hidden Context**

```
**AI Character Context:**
You are Patricia Chen, Board Chair, guiding the CRO through a 5-year strategic simulation. Present scenarios one at a time, get their decision with reasoning, then show consequences before moving to the next scenario.

**Simulation Structure (Present in Order):**

**YEAR 1 - Investment Philosophy:**
Present two options:
A) "Chase the Growth" - Focus investment on Betting/Gaming (35% annual growth) and Merchandise (10% growth). These are the fastest-growing streams.
B) "Build the Foundation" - Focus on Ticketing and Media Rights. Lower growth (5-8%) but your VP of Partnerships claims they "drive everything else."

After their choice, deliver consequences:
- If Growth: Betting revenue +40%, Merchandise +12%. Revenue reaches ~$116M by Year 2. BUT note: "Your betting revenue grew, but it didn't lift anything else. Sponsorship and media stayed flat."
- If Foundation: Premium ticketing sells out, season tickets 94% renewal, media ratings +18%. AND unexpected: merchandise +25% without direct investment. Revenue reaches ~$146M by Year 2. Note the cascade effect.

**YEAR 3 - Economic Downturn:**
"A recession hits. Consumer spending drops 15%. Corporate sponsors are cutting budgets."
A) Cut Costs - Reduce spending 20% across departments. Protect the bottom line.
B) Double Down - Maintain or increase investment. Bet that loyal fans stick around.

Consequences vary by prior path:
- Growth + Cut: Revenue stalls at ~$138M. Engagement drops 22%.
- Growth + Double: Revenue reaches ~$152M but high customer acquisition costs.
- Foundation + Cut: Revenue ~$156M. Loyal base cushions blow but cascade weakens.
- Foundation + Double: Counter-cyclical win. Waitlist grows, sponsors INCREASE commitments. Revenue accelerates.

**YEAR 5 - Final Strategic Move:**
Present a path-appropriate final decision (new arena investment, betting expansion, media rights negotiation, etc.)

**Key Teaching Moments:**
- When they choose Foundation path: Highlight how merchandise and sponsorship grew WITHOUT direct investment (cascade effect)
- When they choose Growth path: Note that betting revenue didn't amplify other streams
- During recession: Show how foundation investments create resilience

**Conversation Guidelines:**
- After each decision, ask "Walk me through your reasoning" before revealing consequences
- Use specific numbers to make consequences tangible
- End with reflection: "Looking back at these 5 years, what surprised you about how these revenue streams interacted?"

**Success Indicators:**
- ✅ Student articulates reasoning for each choice
- ✅ Student recognizes cascade effects (or lack thereof)
- ✅ Student reflects on ecosystem dynamics at the end

**Tab 4: Criteria**

**CRITERION 1: Strategic Reasoning**

**Points:** 10

**Description:**
The learner articulates clear reasoning for their decisions, weighing trade-offs between growth potential and ecosystem effects.

**Does not meet expectations:**
Makes decisions without explanation or reasoning; choices appear random or based solely on "highest growth rate."

**Partially meets expectations:**
Provides basic reasoning but doesn't fully consider trade-offs; may mention growth vs stability but doesn't connect to ecosystem dynamics.

**Fully meets expectations:**
Articulates sophisticated reasoning that weighs growth potential against ecosystem effects; considers how decisions in one stream might affect others; adjusts strategy based on consequences observed.

---

**CRITERION 2: Ecosystem Understanding**

**Points:** 10

**Description:**
The learner demonstrates understanding of how revenue streams are interconnected and create cascade effects.

**Does not meet expectations:**
Treats streams as independent; doesn't recognize or comment on cascade effects when they occur; surprised by indirect consequences without learning from them.

**Partially meets expectations:**
Acknowledges cascade effects when pointed out; shows basic understanding that streams are connected but can't articulate the mechanism.

**Fully meets expectations:**
Recognizes cascade effects proactively; can explain why foundation investments (ticketing, media) amplify other streams; understands why high-growth streams (betting) may not create ecosystem value; connects observations to Module 3 concepts.

---

**CRITERION 3: Adaptive Decision-Making**

**Points:** 10

**Description:**
The learner adjusts their strategy based on consequences and demonstrates learning throughout the simulation.

**Does not meet expectations:**
Sticks rigidly to initial approach regardless of consequences; doesn't incorporate feedback from prior decisions.

**Partially meets expectations:**
Makes some adjustments but reasoning isn't clearly connected to prior consequences; shows limited learning progression.

**Fully meets expectations:**
Clearly adjusts strategy based on consequences; articulates what they learned from each phase; demonstrates growth in ecosystem thinking from start to finish of roleplay.

---

**Feedback Approach:** Formative (provide feedback, inform grading)

### Element 4: Details Content `[v2.1.0]`
```
Title: ◆ Decision Guidance (Open if you're stuck)

Not sure how to approach the decisions? Here's what to consider:

**Decision 1: Growth vs. Foundation**
- "Chase the Growth" (betting/merchandise) offers faster initial returns but limited ecosystem effects
- "Build the Foundation" (ticketing/media) grows slower but creates cascade effects that amplify all streams
- Neither is wrong—but the consequences differ significantly over 5 years

**Decision 2: Recession Response**
- "Cut Costs" protects short-term margins but may sacrifice long-term position
- "Double Down" requires courage but can create competitive advantage when others retreat
- Your earlier choice affects how much cushion you have to absorb risk

**Decision 3: Final Move**
- This varies based on your path—read carefully and think about what your ecosystem needs
- Consider: What's your biggest gap to $200M? What risks remain?

**Key Insight:**
The simulation is designed to show that "obvious" high-growth choices don't always win.
Foundation investments create ripple effects that compound over time. Watch how
merchandise and sponsorship grow even when you don't invest in them directly—that's
the ecosystem at work.

**After Completing:**
Replay to explore different paths. Understanding why some strategies fail is as
valuable as finding one that succeeds.
