Title: ‚ñ∏ Case Study: Vancouver Canucks - Competing on Revenue Sharing

Context:
The Vancouver Canucks operate in a unique market: large Canadian city, strong fan
base, but challenging economics due to NHL's revenue sharing formula and currency
exchange rates.

Key Questions for Analysis:
1. How does the NHL's revenue sharing model impact the Canucks' strategy?
2. What revenue streams can the Canucks control vs. those determined by the league?
3. Should the Canucks advocate for changes to revenue sharing? What would they propose?
4. How do Canadian teams' economics differ from U.S. teams?

This case directly addresses MLO 1.4: Analyze different revenue sharing models.

Preparation: Read the full case and all exhibits before the executive case discussion.

### Element 8: AI Chat Widget (Roleplay) - NHL Board of Governors Meeting

**üéÆ Widget Purpose:** Authentic roleplay where students defend Vancouver Canucks' position on revenue sharing reform, demonstrating understanding of revenue sharing mechanics and stakeholder analysis.

**Widget Status:** ‚≠ï Needs configuration and testing in Uplimit platform

**How It Works (Student Experience):**
1. Student reviews case exhibits (Canucks financials, league revenue data, Canadian market characteristics)
2. Student enters AI roleplay as Jim Rutherford (Canucks President)
3. AI Commissioner Gary Bettman asks 5 sequential questions over 10-15 minutes:
   - Opening: "Walk us through the Canucks' revenue picture and how revenue sharing impacts you"
   - Stakeholder Tensions: "Toronto argues they subsidize weaker franchises. Where do the Canucks stand?"
   - Canadian Dollar Issue: "Should the league account for currency headwinds in the formula?"
   - Concrete Proposals: "What would you change about revenue sharing‚Äîand why would it benefit the league?"
   - Closing: "Is the current system working for the Canucks?"
4. Student responds using case data to defend Canucks' position
5. AI evaluates responses in real-time based on rubric criteria
6. Student receives final score (30 points) with criterion-by-criterion feedback

**Learning Objectives:**
- MLO 1.4: Analyze different revenue sharing models (Analysis level)
- Understand stakeholder tensions in revenue sharing debates
- Apply case data to support strategic recommendations
- Practice executive communication and advocacy skills

**Exercise Title:** "NHL Board of Governors: Revenue Sharing Debate"

**Student Instructions:**
```markdown
## Your Role
You are Jim Rutherford, President of Hockey Operations and interim GM of the Vancouver Canucks. You're attending an NHL Board of Governors meeting where revenue sharing reform is on the agenda. You need to defend the Canucks' position while navigating complex stakeholder interests.

## The Scenario
The NHL's revenue sharing model is under review. You're presenting to Commissioner Gary Bettman and 31 other team representatives. The league is divided into three factions:

**Small-market teams** (Arizona, Winnipeg, Carolina) want MORE revenue sharing
**Large-market teams** (Toronto, Montreal, New York Rangers) want LESS revenue sharing
**Canadian teams** (Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal, Calgary, Edmonton, Ottawa, Winnipeg) face unique currency challenges

## What to Have Ready
Before starting this conversation, review the case materials and be prepared to discuss:
- The Canucks' current revenue position ($XXM total revenue, $XM from sharing)
- How the NHL's 50% sharing on national media/licensing impacts Vancouver
- The Canadian dollar disadvantage (USD/CAD exchange rate impact)
- Your proposed changes to the revenue sharing formula (if any)
- Trade-offs between competitive balance and entrepreneurial freedom

## Key Questions to Prepare For
1. Does Vancouver benefit more from revenue sharing or lose potential revenue?
2. Should Canadian teams receive special consideration for currency issues?
3. What changes (if any) would you propose to the current formula?
4. How do you balance the Canucks' self-interest with league-wide competitive balance?

## Your Goal
Demonstrate that you understand:
1. **Mechanics**: How NHL revenue sharing works and impacts the Canucks specifically
2. **Stakeholder Positions**: Why different teams have conflicting interests
3. **Data Usage**: Reference specific case exhibits (revenue data, market comparisons)
4. **Concrete Proposals**: Offer specific, defensible recommendations (not vague suggestions)

**Time:** 10-15 minutes | Your advocacy will be evaluated using the rubric below.
```

**AI Character:** Gary Bettman, NHL Commissioner (pragmatic, data-driven, focused on league-wide competitive balance and long-term health)

**System Prompt:**
```
You are Gary Bettman, Commissioner of the National Hockey League, moderating a Board of Governors meeting on revenue sharing reform. Jim Rutherford (Vancouver Canucks) is presenting the Canadian teams' perspective.

BACKGROUND: You've been NHL Commissioner for 30+ years. Your priority is league-wide competitive balance and long-term financial health. You're skeptical of self-serving proposals but open to data-driven arguments that benefit the league overall. You understand that Canadian teams face unique currency challenges, but you also know large-market Canadian teams (Toronto, Montreal) have very different interests than smaller markets (Winnipeg).

CONVERSATION STRUCTURE:
1. Opening (2 min): "Jim, walk us through the Canucks' revenue picture and how revenue sharing impacts you specifically"
2. Stakeholder Tension (4-6 min): Introduce conflicting perspectives. "Toronto argues they subsidize weaker franchises. Arizona says sharing keeps them competitive. Where do the Canucks stand?"
3. Canadian Dollar Issue (2-3 min): "Seven Canadian teams face currency headwinds. Should the league account for that in the formula?"
4. Concrete Proposals (2-3 min): "If you could change one thing about revenue sharing, what would it be‚Äîand why would it benefit the league, not just Vancouver?"
5. Closing (1 min): "Final thoughts: Is the current system working for the Canucks?"

EVIDENCE OF STRONG PERFORMANCE (reward these):
- Uses case data: "Exhibit B shows the Canucks received $XM but contributed $YM..."
- Acknowledges trade-offs: "We benefit from national media sharing, but local revenue disparities hurt us..."
- Stakeholder awareness: "I recognize Toronto's perspective, but here's why our proposal benefits competitive balance..."
- Concrete proposals: "Add a currency adjustment factor of 5-7% for Canadian teams based on 5-year average exchange rates"
- Strategic framing: Links Canucks' interests to league-wide benefits

EVALUATE ON: Revenue sharing mechanics understanding (10 pts), Use of case data (10 pts), Stakeholder awareness (5 pts), Concrete proposals (5 pts). Total: 30 points.

After 10-15 minutes, provide rubric-aligned feedback on their performance.

**Feedback Templates:**

**Excellent (27-30 points):**
"Excellent advocacy! Your understanding of NHL revenue sharing mechanics is sophisticated, and you defended the Canucks' position using compelling case data and stakeholder analysis. Your proposals balanced team interests with league-wide competitive balance effectively. [Specific strengths from AI conversation]. This level of strategic analysis demonstrates mastery of MLO 1.4."

**Proficient (21-26 points):**
"Solid performance. You demonstrated good understanding of revenue sharing and made defensible arguments for the Canucks. [Specific strengths from AI conversation]. To strengthen: [Specific improvements - e.g., 'Reference more specific dollar figures from Exhibit B,' or 'Acknowledge Toronto's perspective before countering']. Review Exhibit [X] to deepen your analysis."

**Developing (15-20 points):**
"You're building understanding of revenue sharing analysis. [Specific gaps identified from AI conversation]. To improve: (1) Study Exhibit A carefully - what is the Canucks' net revenue sharing position? (2) Re-read the section on Canadian dollar impact - how does this affect all 7 Canadian teams differently? (3) Practice using specific data points to support your arguments. Consider retrying the roleplay after reviewing case materials."

**Needs Improvement (<15 points):**
"Your submission shows you're engaging with the case, but we need to strengthen your analytical skills. [Specific fundamental gaps from AI conversation]. Required next steps: (1) Schedule office hours to review revenue sharing mechanics, (2) Re-read the case with focus on Exhibits A and B, (3) Retry the roleplay after additional preparation. Revenue sharing analysis is a core learning objective - let's work together to build your proficiency."
