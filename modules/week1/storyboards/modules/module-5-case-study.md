### Element 1: Connecting Introduction Text
**Copy this markdown directly into Uplimit:**

```markdown
You've now built your own theoretical revenue strategy through the Revenue Empire Builder simulation, making allocation decisions across all five streams while managing growth and risk. You've written a Board Strategy Defense memo justifying your choices.

Now it's time to see how theory meets reality. The Vancouver Canucks face actual constraints that your simulation didn't include: NHL revenue sharing formulas, Canadian dollar currency challenges, a competitive Western Conference, and market-size limitations. In this module, you'll analyze real financial data, real strategic dilemmas, and real stakeholder tensions. This is where sports business gets messy‚Äîand interesting.

Title: ‚ñ∏ Case Study: Vancouver Canucks - Competing on Revenue Sharing

Context:
The Vancouver Canucks operate in a unique market: large Canadian city, strong fan
base, but challenging economics due to NHL's revenue sharing formula and currency
exchange rates.

Key Questions for Analysis:
1. How does the NHL's revenue sharing model impact the Canucks' strategy?
2. What revenue streams can the Canucks control vs. those determined by the league?
3. Should the Canucks advocate for changes to revenue sharing? What would they propose?
4. How do Canadian teams' economics differ from U.S. teams?

This case directly addresses MLO 1.4: Analyze different revenue sharing models.

Preparation: Read the full case and all exhibits before the executive case discussion.

### Element 9: AI Roleplay - NHL Board of Governors Meeting

**üéÆ Widget Purpose:** Authentic roleplay where students defend Vancouver Canucks' position on revenue sharing reform, demonstrating understanding of revenue sharing mechanics and stakeholder analysis.

**Widget Status:** ‚≠ï Needs configuration in Uplimit platform

**Element Type:** AI Roleplay

---

## UPLIMIT CONFIGURATION

**Step 1: Select "AI Roleplay Scenario" element in Uplimit builder**

**Step 2: Set Learning Objective**

Choose: **"Add objective myself"** (to test specific skills and ensure learning goals are achieved)

Copy this into the **Objective** field:

```
Students will analyze the NHL's revenue sharing model and defend the Vancouver Canucks' position by applying case data, acknowledging stakeholder tensions, and proposing concrete reforms that balance team interests with league-wide competitive balance. (MLO 1.4 - Analysis level)
```

**Scenario Setup:** Debate/Negotiation

---

**Step 3: Create Scenario**

Choose: **"Create your own scenario"**

Copy this into the **Scenario Context** field:

```
The NHL is conducting a Board of Governors meeting where revenue sharing reform is on the agenda. The league's current revenue sharing model is under review, and Commissioner Gary Bettman is hearing from team representatives across 32 franchises. The league is divided into three factions: small-market teams (Arizona, Winnipeg, Carolina) seeking increased revenue sharing, large-market teams (Toronto, Montreal, New York Rangers) advocating for reduced sharing, and Canadian teams facing unique currency challenges due to USD/CAD exchange rates.

You are presenting the Vancouver Canucks' position on revenue sharing reform to Commissioner Bettman and the Board.

Conversation structure: Commissioner Bettman will ask 5 questions to test your understanding and strategic thinking.
```

Copy this into the **AI Role** field:

```
You are Gary Bettman, NHL Commissioner for 30+ years. You are pragmatic, data-driven, and focused on league-wide competitive balance and long-term financial health. You're moderating a Board of Governors meeting on revenue sharing reform.

Your personality:
- Pragmatic: You care about league-wide benefits, not individual team interests
- Data-driven: You respect arguments backed by case exhibits and financial data
- Skeptical: You're wary of self-serving proposals that don't benefit competitive balance
- Fair: You genuinely listen to well-reasoned arguments that acknowledge trade-offs

Your conversation strategy:

Ask 5 questions to test the student's understanding:

1. **Opening:** "Jim, walk us through the Canucks' revenue picture and how revenue sharing impacts you specifically"
   - Test if they understand the basic mechanics (which streams are shared, Canucks' net position)

2. **Stakeholder Tension:** "Toronto argues they subsidize weaker franchises. Arizona says sharing keeps them competitive. Where do the Canucks stand?"
   - Probe for stakeholder awareness and ability to navigate conflicting interests

3. **Canadian Dollar Issue:** "Seven Canadian teams face currency headwinds. Should the league account for that in the formula?"
   - Test if they can make a compelling case for special consideration without alienating U.S. teams

4. **Concrete Proposals:** "If you could change one thing about revenue sharing, what would it be‚Äîand why would it benefit the league, not just Vancouver?"
   - Demand specificity (not vague "we need more sharing")
   - Reward proposals framed as league-wide benefits

5. **Closing:** "Final thoughts: Is the current system working for the Canucks?"
   - Allow final summary and advocacy

After these 5 questions, provide rubric-aligned feedback on their performance.
```

Copy this into the **Student Role** field:

```
You are Jim Rutherford, President of Hockey Operations for the Vancouver Canucks, presenting to the NHL Board of Governors on revenue sharing reform. Use case data to support your position and acknowledge competing stakeholder interests.
```

**Note:** Keep this field minimal since it displays to students without formatting. The detailed instructions will appear in the "Student Instructions" section (Step 6) with proper markdown formatting.

---

**Step 4: Hidden Context (AI-only information)**

Copy this into the **Hidden Context** field:

```
**AI Character Context:**
You are Gary Bettman conducting a case-based executive debate. The student has read the Vancouver Canucks case (Exhibits A, B, C) and must now defend a position on revenue sharing reform.

**Key Constraints (inform your skepticism):**
- Canadian teams face unique currency challenges (USD/CAD exchange rates)
- Large-market Canadian teams (Toronto, Montreal) have very different interests than smaller markets (Winnipeg)
- Small-market U.S. teams depend on revenue sharing for survival
- Executives who acknowledge trade-offs are more credible than those claiming win-win solutions

**What Strong Performance Looks Like (use for evaluation):**
- ‚úÖ Uses case data: "Exhibit B shows the Canucks received $XM but contributed $YM..."
- ‚úÖ Acknowledges trade-offs: "We benefit from national media sharing, but local revenue disparities hurt us..."
- ‚úÖ Stakeholder awareness: "I recognize Toronto's perspective, but here's why our proposal benefits competitive balance..."
- ‚úÖ Concrete proposals: "Add a currency adjustment factor of 5-7% for Canadian teams based on 5-year average exchange rates"
- ‚úÖ Strategic framing: Links Canucks' interests to league-wide benefits (competitive balance, fan engagement, market stability)

**Conversation Objectives (5 questions):**
1. Test revenue sharing mechanics understanding (which streams are shared)
2. Probe stakeholder awareness (Toronto vs. Arizona vs. Vancouver tensions)
3. Assess ability to make data-driven arguments from case exhibits
4. Evaluate strategic framing (league-wide benefits, not just Canucks' interests)
5. Determine specificity of reform proposals (concrete vs. vague)

**After completing 5 questions:** Provide rubric-aligned feedback using the 4 criteria defined in the rubric.

## üéØ FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION

**How Module 5 Supports Your Final Strategic Vision:**

Module 5 applied all Week 1 frameworks to a real NHL franchise facing complex revenue-sharing and currency challenges. This case analysis prepares you to analyze YOUR chosen property in Week 5.

**What You Learned:**
- Revenue sharing creates strategic constraints (NHL's 50% sharing limits Canucks' flexibility)
- Mid-market teams face unique challenges (contributing to large-market sharing pools while competing with small-market recipients)
- Currency headwinds impact Canadian teams (earn CAD, pay salaries in USD)
- Real cases involve governance politics, not just financial optimization

**How to Apply This to Your Final Project:**

When you analyze your chosen property in Week 5, use the Canucks case as your analytical template:

- **Contextual Constraints:** Acknowledge the structural factors beyond your control. The Canucks can't exit NHL revenue sharing; you likely face similar constraints in your property's league/sport. Your vision should work within these realities.
- **Strategic Positioning:** The Canucks are a mid-market team‚Äîneither dominant like NYR/TOR nor struggling like ARI/FLA. Where does YOUR property fit? Module 5 taught you to analyze positioning: Are you a market leader, challenger, or underdog? Each requires different strategies.
- **Financial Modeling:** Use the Canucks' revenue breakdown as a benchmark. If your property is an NHL team, compare your projections to the Canucks' actual financials. If you're in a different sport, adapt the framework.

**Real-World Application:** The Canucks case revealed that financial statements don't tell the whole story. Governance structures, league politics, and macroeconomic forces shape strategy. Your Week 5 capstone must account for these non-financial factors‚ÄîModule 5 taught you how.

---

## Module 5 Complete - Transition to Module 6

**What You've Learned:**
You've analyzed a real professional sports organization facing complex revenue-sharing challenges. The Vancouver Canucks case revealed how NHL's revenue-sharing formula impacts team strategy, how Canadian teams face unique currency headwinds, and how mid-market franchises navigate tensions between large-market contributors and small-market recipients. You've seen theory applied to actual financial constraints and governance dynamics.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Revenue sharing creates winners and losers‚Äîmid-market teams face complex trade-offs
- Canadian dollar fluctuations add major financial risk for Canadian franchises
- Revenue sharing limits strategic autonomy while maintaining competitive balance
- Real organizations face constraints theoretical models don't capture (currency, market size, ownership priorities)
- Stakeholder analysis reveals competing interests (Toronto vs. Arizona vs. Vancouver)

**Up Next: Module 6 - Your Assessment**
You've learned the framework (Modules 2-3), applied it strategically (Module 4), and analyzed a real case (Module 5). Now it's time to demonstrate mastery. In Module 6, you'll write a comprehensive Reflection Memo synthesizing all Week 1 learning and applying it to a strategic investment decision.

Ready to show what you've learned? Let's wrap up Week 1!
