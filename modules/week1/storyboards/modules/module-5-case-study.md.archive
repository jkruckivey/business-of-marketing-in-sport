### Element 1: Connecting Introduction Text
**Copy this markdown directly into Uplimit:**

```markdown
You've now experienced revenue ecosystem dynamics firsthand through the Revenue Ecosystem Challenge, making strategic decisions as CRO while observing how your choices created ripple effects across all five streams. You've written a Strategic Decision Analysis reflecting on what you learned.

Now it's time to see how theory meets reality. The Nashville Predators face actual constraints that your simulation didn't include: market size limitations, competition from other sports, arena economics, and the challenge of building a hockey fanbase in the American South. In this module, you'll analyze real financial data, real strategic dilemmas, and real stakeholder tensions. This is where sports business gets messy—and interesting.

Title: ▸ Case Study: Nashville Predators - Marketing Strategy for an NHL Franchise

Context:
It's summer 2008. The Nashville Predators management team must consider the future
of the franchise. After ownership instability and potential relocation threats from
Canadian billionaire Jim Balsillie, management needs to prepare a comprehensive
strategy—whether staying in Nashville or recommending one of five candidate cities.

Key Questions for Analysis:
1. What criteria should drive the location decision? (Market size, corporate support, hockey culture, arena economics)
2. How do revenue projections differ across the six options? (Nashville, Hamilton, Winnipeg, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Houston)
3. Which marketing strategies are most effective for each market type?
4. How should the team balance financial returns with on-ice success?

Case: Ivey Publishing 9B09A006 - Nashville Predators: Marketing Strategy for an NHL Franchise

This case directly addresses WLO 1.3 (evaluate growth potential) and WLO 1.4 (analyze revenue models).

Preparation: Read the full case and all exhibits before the ownership pitch roleplay.

CASE ACCESS INSTRUCTIONS:

📚 Required Reading: Nashville Predators: Marketing Strategy for an NHL Franchise
Publisher: Ivey Publishing (Richard Ivey School of Business)
Case Number: 9B09A006
Length: 30 pages including exhibits

HOW TO ACCESS:
1. Visit Ivey Publishing: https://www.iveypublishing.ca/

CASE OVERVIEW:
The Nashville Predators entered the NHL in 1998 as part of the league's expansion
into non-traditional hockey markets. Despite strong on-ice performance (playoff
appearances every year since 2003), the team struggled financially—ranking 27th
in attendance (14,910/game) and 24th in gate revenue despite competitive success.

After multiple ownership changes and a failed sale to Jim Balsillie (who planned
to move the team to Hamilton, Ontario), management must prepare strategic options
for any potential new owner.

YOUR TASK:
Analyze whether the Predators should stay in Nashville or relocate to one of five
candidate cities. Your recommendation must include:
- Location decision with supporting rationale
- Revenue projections for your recommended city
- Marketing strategy tailored to that market
- Implementation considerations

### Element 7A: Practice Quiz - Case Comprehension Check

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Exercise - Practice Quiz** element
2. Configure as ungraded self-assessment
3. Add the following 5 multiple choice questions:

**Purpose:** Ensure students have understood the key case data before proceeding to the AI Roleplay ownership pitch.

---

### Question 1: Nashville's Current Financial Position

Based on Exhibit A, what is the Nashville Predators' estimated EBITDA for 2007/08?

A) +$5.3 million profit
B) -$5.3 million loss ✅
C) Break-even ($0)
D) -$15 million loss

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! The Predators are losing approximately $5.3 million annually ($58M revenue vs. $63.3M expenses). This financial pressure drives the strategic question: can Nashville be turned around, or should the franchise relocate?

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Review Exhibit A carefully. Compare total revenue ($58M) against total expenses ($63.3M). The difference represents whether the team is profitable or losing money.

---

### Question 2: Corporate Revenue Weakness

According to the case data, what percentage of Nashville's ticket revenue comes from corporate purchases versus the NHL average?

A) Nashville: 60%, NHL average: 30%
B) Nashville: 45%, NHL average: 60%
C) Nashville: 30%, NHL average: 60% ✅
D) Nashville: 50%, NHL average: 50%

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Nashville's corporate ticket purchases are only 30% versus the NHL average of 60%. This represents a major revenue opportunity—if corporate support could match league average, ticket revenue would increase substantially.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Review the Key Observations in Exhibit A. Corporate support is one of Nashville's biggest weaknesses compared to other NHL markets. Look for the comparison between Nashville's performance and the NHL average.

---

### Question 3: Marketing Efficiency

Based on Exhibit B, which city has the MOST efficient marketing cost per incremental ticket sold?

A) Nashville ($750/ticket)
B) Houston ($545/ticket)
C) Hamilton ($375/ticket) ✅
D) Las Vegas ($625/ticket)

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Hamilton has the most efficient marketing at $375/incremental ticket. This reflects the strong existing hockey culture from Toronto spillover—fans are already interested, requiring less promotional spending to convert them to ticket buyers.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Review Exhibit B's TV/Radio Advertising data. Marketing efficiency is calculated as cost divided by incremental tickets gained. Traditional hockey markets tend to be more efficient because fans are already interested.

---

### Question 4: Corporate Sponsorship Potential

Which city offers the HIGHEST estimated corporate sponsorship potential for 2008/09?

A) Las Vegas ($8.5M - gaming industry)
B) Winnipeg ($7.5M - historic hockey market)
C) Kansas City ($5.0M - Fortune 500 base)
D) Hamilton ($10M - Toronto market access) ✅

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Hamilton offers the highest corporate sponsorship potential at $10M, benefiting from proximity to Toronto's massive corporate base. Houston ($9M) is second, followed by Las Vegas ($8.5M). Nashville's current sponsorship revenue of $5M ranks among the lowest.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Review Exhibit C's Estimated Corporate Sponsorship section. Consider which markets have the deepest corporate bases and strongest business communities to support NHL-level sponsorship deals.

---

### Question 5: Strategic Trade-offs

Based on all three exhibits, what is the MAIN strategic trade-off when comparing Hamilton vs. Houston as relocation options?

A) Hamilton has better weather; Houston has a larger population
B) Hamilton requires territorial fees and new arena costs; Houston has more corporate support but no hockey culture ✅
C) Hamilton fans will pay more; Houston arena is newer
D) Hamilton has better media deals; Houston has cheaper player salaries

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Hamilton's strengths (passionate fans, Toronto spillover, high sponsorship) come with significant costs: $100M+ territorial fees to NHL and need for a new $200M arena. Houston offers excellent corporate support and the largest market, but must develop hockey culture from scratch. This trade-off illustrates why relocation decisions are complex.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Think about what makes each city attractive AND what challenges each presents. Hamilton has strong hockey culture but faces what barriers? Houston has what advantages but lacks what element? The strategic decision involves weighing multiple factors.

## UPLIMIT CONFIGURATION

### Tab 1: Learning Outcome

**Name:** Predators Ownership Pitch: Market Feasibility Analysis

**Learning Outcome:**
Students will analyze market feasibility for an NHL franchise by evaluating six potential cities, developing revenue projections, and presenting a strategic recommendation that balances financial returns with market development potential. This supports WLO 1.3 (evaluate growth potential) and WLO 1.4 (analyze revenue models) at the Analysis level.

**Scenario Setup:** Consulting Presentation

---

### Tab 2: Scenario

**Context:**
It's summer 2008. The Nashville Predators are seeking new ownership after the previous owner filed for bankruptcy. A potential ownership group—led by Margaret Chen, a successful private equity investor with experience in entertainment and hospitality—is conducting due diligence.

You are a sports business consultant who has been hired to analyze the franchise's strategic options. Ms. Chen has asked you to present your findings: Should the new ownership keep the team in Nashville, or pursue relocation to one of five candidate cities (Hamilton, Winnipeg, Kansas City, Las Vegas, or Houston)?

This is a collaborative conversation—Ms. Chen genuinely wants to understand your analysis and reasoning. She's smart but new to sports business, so she'll ask clarifying questions about your methodology.

**Role of AI (Margaret Chen):** Margaret Chen is a successful private equity investor with experience in entertainment and hospitality investments. She's smart, analytical, and asks probing questions. She's new to sports business and genuinely wants to understand how NHL economics work before committing $200-300 million.

**Role of Student:** You are a sports business consultant presenting your market feasibility analysis for the Nashville Predators to a potential ownership group. Use case data to support your recommendation for which city the franchise should call home.

---

### Tab 3: Hidden Context

**Hidden Context (AI knows, student doesn't see):**

```
CHARACTER CONTEXT:
You are Margaret Chen, a PE investor considering purchasing the Nashville Predators. The student has read the full Ivey case (9B09A006) with 30 pages of exhibits and must now present their strategic recommendation.

YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO THE STUDENT:
- You're the potential buyer, but this is collaborative—you genuinely want to understand their analysis
- You haven't done the calculations yourself—that's why you hired them
- You're curious, not testing or trying to trip them up
- You need confidence in their recommendation before writing a $200-300M check

---
REFERENCE DATA (Use to guide your questions - NEVER reveal these numbers):

CURRENT NASHVILLE SITUATION:
- Total revenue: ~$58M
- Total expenses: ~$63.3M

- Winnipeg: ~$2.5M (passionate fans, but smallest market)

TICKET REVENUE POTENTIAL (per season):
- Hamilton: ~$68M (21,000 capacity, 94% fill, premium pricing)

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - DO NOT REVEAL THESE NUMBERS:
You have this data to help you ask smart follow-up questions, but you must NEVER:
- State any of these figures yourself
- Confirm or deny if the student's numbers are correct
- Say "that's right" or "that's wrong" about specific figures
- Provide the "answer" if they seem stuck

HOW TO USE THE REFERENCE DATA:
You've reviewed the case materials, so you have a general sense of the numbers—but you haven't built the financial model yourself. Use this knowledge to ask good follow-up questions.

If their number is CLOSE (within ~10%):
- Accept it naturally and ask: "And what does that mean for profitability?"
- Or: "Interesting—how does that compare to the other options?"

If their number seems OFF (more than ~20% different):
- Don't say it's wrong, but show curiosity: "Help me understand how you got to that figure"
- Or: "Walk me through that calculation—I want to make sure I can defend it to my partners"

If their number is WAY OFF (wrong order of magnitude):
- Gently probe: "Hmm, that doesn't quite match what I saw in the exhibits. Can we walk through it?"
- Or: "Before I take this to my partners, let's double-check those numbers. Where did that come from?"

---
WHAT STRONG PERFORMANCE LOOKS LIKE:
- ✅ Clear recommendation: States a specific city with confidence
- ✅ Uses case data: "Exhibit 14 shows Nashville is losing $5.3M annually..."
- ✅ Revenue projections: Provides specific numbers for ticket revenue, sponsorship, broadcast
- ✅ Marketing strategy: References Exhibit 18 data on promotional effectiveness
- ✅ Risk awareness: Acknowledges downsides of their recommendation
- ✅ Trade-off analysis: Explains why they rejected other options

WHAT NEEDS PROBING:
- ❌ Vague recommendations: Respond with "Can you be more specific? Which city exactly?"
- ❌ No numbers: Respond with "What's the revenue projection? I need actual figures."
- ❌ Ignoring risks: Respond with "What could go wrong with this plan?"
- ❌ One-dimensional analysis: Respond with "Why not [alternative city]? Walk me through that trade-off."
