# Reflecting on Your Revenue Ecosystem Journey

You've just completed five simulated years as Chief Revenue Officer, making strategic decisions that shaped your franchise's future. You chose between chasing high-growth streams and building foundations. You navigated an economic downturn. You made a final strategic move.

But here's what matters most: **What did you learn about how revenue streams interact?**

Some of you doubled revenue. Some fell short. The outcome matters less than understanding *why* your choices led to those results. The cascade effects you observed—or missed—reveal something important about sports business strategy.

In this module, you'll:
- **Reflect on your decision path** and what surprised you
- **Examine the cascade effects** you observed (or didn't)
- **Connect your experience** to real-world team strategies
- **Prepare for your CFL project** where you'll apply these insights

The goal isn't to figure out if you were "right"—it's to understand the ecosystem dynamics that determine which strategies succeed in which contexts.
```

## Element 2: Infobox - The Four Paths

**Uplimit Callout Configuration:**
- **Variant:** Blue (informational)
- **Title:** The Four Strategic Paths

```
Here are four common strategic paths teams take when building revenue. As you reflect on your Revenue Ecosystem Challenge conversation, consider which approach best describes your decisions—or whether you charted a different course entirely.

**Path 1: Growth → Cut**
Chase high-growth streams (betting, merchandise), then cut costs during a recession. Typical outcome: Revenue stalls around $138M. New customers don't stick around when times get tough.

**Path 2: Growth → Double Down**
Chase growth, then double down during a recession. Typical outcome: Revenue reaches ~$152M, but customer acquisition costs are brutal. Growth feels expensive and fragile.

**Path 3: Foundation → Cut**
Build the foundation (ticketing, media), then cut during a recession. Typical outcome: Revenue hits ~$156M. A loyal base cushions the blow, but the cascade effect weakens when investment stops.

**Path 4: Foundation → Double Down**
Build the foundation, then double down during a recession. Typical outcome: Revenue accelerates to ~$178M. Counter-cyclical investment pays off—competitors cut while you gain market share.

**Which path most closely matches your approach? What did you learn about why certain strategies succeed or struggle?**

## Element 3: Details - Real-World Examples

## From Simulation to Reality

The strategic paths you just explored aren't just simulation mechanics—they reflect real decisions that actual teams make every day. How do professional franchises balance growth opportunities against foundation-building? Let's look at three teams that represent distinctly different approaches.

As you read these examples, consider: Which strategy most closely resembles the path you took in your simulation? And which might fit your CFL expansion city?
```

**Accordion Title:** Real-World Examples: How Actual Teams Apply These Strategies

```markdown
## Dallas Cowboys: The Commercial Maximizer

The Cowboys generate more revenue than any NFL franchise (~$1.2 billion annually) despite not winning a Super Bowl since 1996. How?

**Strategy:** Maximize every commercial opportunity

- **AT&T Stadium:** Jones operates the venue with full revenue control under a long-term agreement with the City of Arlington; captures 100% of game-day and non-game revenue
- **Sponsorship:** ~$250M annually from corporate partnerships, including unprecedented stadium naming rights; among the highest in professional sports
- **Merchandising:** Consistently #1 in NFL merchandise sales globally
- **Media:** Primetime games, "America's Team" brand commands premium advertising rates

**Why it works:** Dallas is a massive market (4th largest metro), the Cowboys brand transcends local geography, and Jerry Jones has full operational control of the stadium. They can monetize every revenue stream without league constraints.

**Trade-off:** Fan criticism of commercialization; tension between revenue optimization and "authenticity"

**Connection to your simulation:** This is what "Chase the Growth" looks like when you have the market size and brand to support it. In smaller markets, this approach may not generate the same cascade effects.

## Green Bay Packers: The Community Anchor

The only publicly-owned franchise in major North American sports, the Packers prioritize community connection over commercial maximization.

**Strategy:** Fan experience and tradition first

- **Stock sales:** Community ownership creates intense loyalty (but no dividends); 360,000+ shareholders own the franchise collectively
- **Ticket pricing:** Below-market prices; season ticket waiting list is 148,000 people as of 2024, representing 30+ years of wait time
- **Sponsorship:** Selective partnerships that fit brand values; lower total sponsorship revenue than comparable markets
- **Lambeau Field:** Historic venue drives tourism; generates approximately $18 million in economic impact per home game; 2025 NFL Draft alone generated $72.9 million

**Why it works:** Green Bay is the smallest market in major pro sports, but fanatical fans and national brand ("Frozen Tundra," "Titletown") create sustainable revenue through media and merchandise. Community ownership structure prevents relocation threats and maintains fan commitment.

**Trade-off:** Lower per-game revenue than possible; can't relocate or threaten relocation for stadium leverage; ownership structure limits financial flexibility for major capital investments

**Connection to your simulation:** This is "Build the Foundation" taken to its logical extreme. The cascade effect is powerful—loyal fans drive media value, which drives merchandise, which attracts sponsors who want "authentic" association.

## Vegas Golden Knights: The Growth Gambler

Expansion franchise (2017) that immediately became one of the most valuable in the NHL, growing from a $500 million expansion fee to a $1.85 billion valuation (Sportico 2024).

**Strategy:** Entertainment-first, bet on emerging streams

- **In-game experience:** Vegas-style production, medieval knight theme, elaborate pre-game shows designed to maximize entertainment value
- **Betting integration:** First major pro team in legal sports betting capital; integrated betting mechanics into fan engagement strategy
- **Premium seating:** High percentage of luxury/premium tickets targeting Vegas corporate and tourist market; premium pricing strategy unique in NHL
- **Merchandise:** Expansion novelty drove exceptional merchandise sales; maintained top-5 NHL merchandise ranking for multi-year period
- **Stanley Cup success:** Won 2023 Stanley Cup in just their sixth season, accelerating brand value and fan engagement

**Why it works:** Vegas has no established sports loyalties, massive tourist flow (~42 million annually), legal betting infrastructure, and entertainment-industry mindset. Market expansion potential and novelty premium attracted national attention and premium sponsorship deals.

**Trade-off:** Long-term fan sustainability remains unproven; heavily reliant on novelty effect and tourism; championship success improved trajectory but initial growth was entertainment/novelty-driven rather than traditional sports loyalty

**Connection to your simulation:** Vegas shows what happens when you "Chase Growth" in a market perfectly suited for it. The question is whether they're building foundation (loyal local fans) or just capturing growth (tourists, novelty). Sound familiar?

## Comparative Analysis: Revenue Generation Models

| Model | Primary Revenue Driver | Growth Trajectory | Risk Profile | Sustainability |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Cowboys (Commercial Max)** | Sponsorship + merchandising + venue control | Steady 3-5% annual growth | High (market saturation risk) | Long-term stable if brand maintained |
| **Packers (Community Anchor)** | Media rights + merchandise + selective sponsorship | Modest 2-3% annual growth | Low (structural stability) | Very long-term sustainable; limited upside |
| **Vegas Knights (Growth Gambler)** | Premium seating + novelty effect + betting integration | Aggressive 8-12% annual growth (slowing post-championship) | High (novelty cliff risk; post-championship reset) | Medium-term depends on community adoption |

**Key Takeaways:**

Each model reflects different strategic priorities: maximizing commercial value, ensuring stability through community ties, or pursuing rapid growth through market timing and premium positioning.

- **Cowboys:** Prioritizes sponsorship, merchandising, and venue control. Delivers steady growth with high saturation risk but remains sustainable if brand strength is maintained.
- **Packers:** Built on media rights, merchandise, and selective sponsorship. Offers modest growth with low structural risk and exceptional sustainability, though with limited upside.
- **Vegas Knights:** Leverages premium seating, novelty appeal, and betting integration for aggressive growth. Carries high novelty cliff risk, with sustainability dependent on building genuine community foundation.

**The simulation lesson applies:** High growth rates (Vegas) can be misleading if they don't create cascade effects. Foundation investments (Packers) compound over time. The "right" strategy depends entirely on your market context.

# Applying Ecosystem Thinking to Your CFL Project

Everything you've explored this week—the five revenue streams, the trade-offs, the market-dependent strategies—comes together in your Anchor Project: building a revenue strategy for a CFL expansion franchise.

**Your CFL city will face the same questions you just wrestled with:**

- **What's your market size?** A Toronto expansion plays differently than Halifax or Saskatoon.
- **Who's your competition?** Are you the only game in town, or fighting for attention?
- **What's your venue situation?** Building new? Sharing? What does that mean for revenue capture?
- **What's your fanbase like?** Established CFL culture? Or building from scratch?

**The strategy that worked in your simulation may or may not fit your CFL city.** That's the challenge—and the opportunity.

**Consider what you learned:**
- If Foundation → Double Down succeeded for you, does your CFL city have the conditions to replicate that? (Loyal fanbase potential, media interest, corporate base?)
- If Growth strategies hit ceilings, what does that mean for a market without an established fan base?
- Which real-world model (Cowboys, Packers, Vegas) best fits your target city?

In the coming weeks, you'll apply these frameworks to a real market analysis. The revenue philosophy you articulated in your simulation? Keep it in mind. You might need to defend it—or change it—once you dig into your city's specifics.

Your simulation experience isn't a template—it's a lens. Use it wisely.

## Element 5: Infobox - What's Next

**Uplimit Infobox Configuration:**
- **Variant:** Green (Next Steps)

```
Title: ✓ What's Next: Module 6

**You've completed the Revenue Ecosystem Challenge and reflection.**

In Module 6, you'll write a brief reflection (300 words) capturing what you learned about sports revenue ecosystems. This isn't about defending your choices—it's about demonstrating you understand how the pieces fit together.

**Module 6 asks:**
- What makes sports revenue different from other businesses?
- How do revenue streams connect to each other?
- What worked in your simulation, and what would you do differently?

Then in Module 7, you'll apply everything to your CFL Expansion Milestone 1: selecting a city and projecting 5-year revenue.

Continue to Module 6 when ready.

## Instructor Notes

**Module 5 Purpose:**
- Bridge between experiential learning (Module 4 roleplay) and assessment (Module 6)
- Help students connect their simulation experience to real-world examples
- Prepare students for CFL project application

**Why This Structure:**
- Students need time to PROCESS the simulation before being assessed
- Four Paths framing gives them reference points without assuming a specific experience
- Real-world examples validate that cascade effects aren't just simulation mechanics
- CFL bridge makes the learning immediately applicable

**Assessment Note:**
- Module 5 is formative (reflection, not graded)
- Module 6 is summative (25-point written reflection)
- This sequence: Experience → Reflect → Assess follows sound pedagogical practice

**For Students Who Took Different Paths:**
The Four Paths are presented as reference points, not prescriptive outcomes. Students whose AI roleplay conversation went in different directions can still compare their approach to the strategic frameworks. All paths teach valuable lessons about ecosystem dynamics.
