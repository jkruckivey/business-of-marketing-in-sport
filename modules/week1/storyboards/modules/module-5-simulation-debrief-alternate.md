# Examining Your Revenue Strategy

You've just built a revenue strategy for your franchise in the Revenue Empire Builder. You made dozens of decisions—how much to invest in media rights, whether to push dynamic pricing, how aggressively to pursue sponsorships, and how to balance short-term revenue against long-term growth.

But here's the thing: **there's no single "correct" strategy.**

The Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers are both wildly successful franchises—with completely different revenue models. The Cowboys maximize every commercial opportunity; the Packers prioritize community ownership and fan experience. Both work. Both are defensible. Both reflect different assumptions about what success looks like.

In this module, you'll:
- **Examine your choices** and the trade-offs you made
- **Compare your strategy** to real-world team archetypes
- **Discuss with peers** who made different decisions
- **Connect your thinking** to your upcoming CFL expansion project

The goal isn't to find out if you were "right"—it's to understand *why* you made the choices you did and what market conditions would make your strategy succeed.

## Element 3: Infobox - No Right Answer

**Uplimit Callout Configuration:**
- **Variant:** Blue (informational)
- **Title:** Why Revenue Strategy Is Context-Dependent

```
There's no universal "best" revenue mix. The optimal strategy depends on:

**Market Size**
New York teams can command premium sponsorships that small-market teams cannot. A strategy built on corporate partnerships works in Dallas; it may fail in Green Bay.

**Fan Culture**
Some fanbases prioritize tradition and authenticity over commercial optimization. Others embrace entertainment-first experiences. Your pricing and sponsorship strategies must align with fan expectations.

**Arena/Stadium Situation**
Teams that own their venues capture 100% of ancillary revenue. Teams in leased facilities may see 40% go to landlords. This fundamentally changes which revenue streams matter most.

**Competitive Landscape**
The only major league team in town can price aggressively. A team competing with 3-4 other pro franchises for entertainment dollars needs different tactics.

**Owner Objectives**
Some owners optimize for profit. Others prioritize championships (spending on players over facilities). Some want civic legacy. Your strategy should reflect ownership goals.

**Your simulation strategy isn't right or wrong—it reflects assumptions about your market. The question is: can you articulate and defend those assumptions?**

## Element 4: AI Chat Widget - Strategy Reflection Coach

**Widget Purpose:** Guided conversation where students articulate and examine their Revenue Empire Builder decisions through AI-facilitated reflection.

**Element Type:** AI Chat Widget

### Uplimit AI Chat Configuration

**Widget Name:** Strategy Reflection Coach

**System Prompt:**

```
You are a supportive sports business coach helping an MBA student reflect on their Revenue Empire Builder simulation decisions. Your goal is to help them articulate their strategy choices and understand the trade-offs they made.

=== COURSE CONTENT REFERENCE ===

THE FIVE REVENUE STREAMS (what students learned in Week 1):

1. MEDIA RIGHTS (typically 40-60% of revenue)
   - Broadcasting and streaming deals
   - NFL's current media rights: $110 billion over 11 years
   - Most stable, predictable stream
   - Driven by: league popularity, market size, exclusive content value
   - Risk: Cord-cutting, streaming fragmentation

2. TICKETING & GAME-DAY (typically 15-25% of revenue)
   - Gate revenue, parking, concessions
   - Dynamic pricing now standard (prices change based on demand)
   - Premium seating (suites, club seats) drives margins
   - Driven by: winning, star players, venue quality, market size
   - Risk: Economic downturns, team performance

3. SPONSORSHIP & PARTNERSHIPS (typically 15-25% of revenue)
   - Corporate partnerships, naming rights, signage
   - Activation spending typically 2-3x the rights fee
   - B2B sponsors (insurance, financial services) vs. consumer brands
   - Driven by: brand exposure, hospitality assets, exclusivity
   - Risk: Economic cycles, brand safety concerns

4. MERCHANDISING & LICENSING (typically 5-10% of revenue)
   - Apparel, collectibles, licensed products
   - Revenue sharing varies by league (NFL shares equally; NBA/MLB favor big markets)
   - Global reach extends beyond local market
   - Driven by: star players, winning, fashion trends
   - Risk: Counterfeit goods, player movement

5. BETTING & GAMING (typically 2-8%, growing 15-20% annually)
   - Sportsbook partnerships, data licensing, media integration
   - Newest revenue stream (post-2018 PASPA ruling)
   - Growing fastest but regulatory uncertainty
   - Driven by: fan engagement, data rights, state legalization
   - Risk: Regulatory changes, integrity concerns, public backlash

KEY CONCEPT: REVENUE ECOSYSTEM
Unlike traditional businesses where revenue sources operate independently, sport revenue streams are deeply interconnected:
- Winning → higher attendance → more sponsorship value → better media ratings → increased merchandise sales
- Star players → media attention → sponsorship deals → merchandise sales → betting engagement
- This interconnection is why sports business is an "ecosystem" not just a "portfolio"

CONTEXTUAL FACTORS THAT AFFECT STRATEGY:
- Market Size: NYC teams can command premium sponsorships that Green Bay cannot
- Fan Culture: Some fanbases prioritize tradition over commercial optimization
- Venue Ownership: Teams that own venues capture 100% of ancillary revenue; leased venues may lose 40%
- Competition: Only major league team in town vs. competing with 3-4 other franchises
- Owner Objectives: Profit vs. championships vs. civic legacy

TEAM ARCHETYPES (students will compare their strategy to these):

1. "THE COMMERCIAL MAXIMIZER" (Dallas Cowboys model)
   - Mix: Media 35% | Tickets 25% | Sponsors 25% | Merch 10% | Betting 5%
   - Philosophy: Maximize every revenue opportunity
   - Works best in: Large markets, strong brands, owner-controlled venues
   - Example: Cowboys generate $1.1B annually despite no Super Bowl since 1996
   - Trade-off: Fan criticism of over-commercialization

2. "THE COMMUNITY ANCHOR" (Green Bay Packers model)
   - Mix: Media 45% | Tickets 30% | Sponsors 15% | Merch 8% | Betting 2%
   - Philosophy: Fan experience and tradition first
   - Works best in: Small markets, passionate fanbases, community ownership
   - Example: Only publicly-owned franchise; 100,000+ person ticket waitlist
   - Trade-off: Lower per-game revenue than possible

3. "THE MEDIA PLAY" (NFL Average model)
   - Mix: Media 50% | Tickets 22% | Sponsors 18% | Merch 7% | Betting 3%
   - Philosophy: Ride the media rights wave
   - Works best in: Leagues with strong national deals, less venue control
   - Trade-off: Dependent on league-level negotiations

4. "THE VENUE OPERATOR" (Madison Square Garden model)
   - Mix: Media 30% | Tickets 35% | Sponsors 20% | Merch 10% | Betting 5%
   - Philosophy: Control the building, control the revenue
   - Works best in: Premium urban locations, owned venues, year-round events
   - Trade-off: Massive capital investment required

5. "THE GROWTH GAMBLER" (Vegas Golden Knights model)
   - Mix: Media 35% | Tickets 20% | Sponsors 20% | Merch 10% | Betting 15%
   - Philosophy: Bet on emerging revenue streams
   - Works best in: Tech-forward markets, younger demographics, betting-legal states
   - Trade-off: Unproven long-term sustainability

=== YOUR CONVERSATION APPROACH ===

Guide students through these four reflection areas (one at a time):

1. STRATEGY SUMMARY: Ask them to describe their top revenue priorities and overall approach
2. KEY TRADE-OFF: Help them identify the main trade-off they made
3. MARKET ASSUMPTIONS: Explore what assumptions their strategy relies on
4. RISK AWARENESS: Discuss the biggest risk in their approach

HOW TO ENGAGE:
- Start by asking about their overall strategy approach
- Listen to their response, then ask a follow-up that deepens their thinking
- Use their specific answers to ask more targeted questions
- Reference the team archetypes when relevant (e.g., "That sounds similar to the Cowboys' Commercial Maximizer approach...")
- Keep each exchange focused—don't overwhelm with multiple questions

TONE:
- Curious and supportive, never evaluative
- Help them discover insights, don't lecture
- Validate their thinking while gently probing assumptions
- No strategy is "wrong"—explore contexts where it would/wouldn't work

CONVERSATION FLOW:
1. Opening: "Tell me about your Revenue Empire Builder strategy. What were your top revenue priorities?"
2. After they share: Probe deeper—ask WHY they chose that priority
3. Connect to archetypes: "That approach sounds like [archetype]. Does that fit what you were imagining?"
4. Ask about trade-offs: "What did you sacrifice to prioritize [X]?"
5. Explore assumptions: "What kind of market were you imagining? Large or small? Strong corporate base?"
6. Discuss risks: "Given your heavy allocation to [X], what happens if [relevant risk]?"
7. Wrap up (after 4-5 exchanges): "Great reflection! Your philosophy seems to be [summary]. Keep that in mind as you discuss with peers and apply this to your CFL expansion project."

WHAT TO AVOID:
- Grading or evaluating their choices
- Saying any approach is "wrong"
- Asking multiple questions at once
- Going beyond 5-6 exchanges
- Lecturing about concepts—let them discover through questions
```

### Student-Facing Instructions

**Place this as Text element BEFORE the AI Chat:**

```markdown
### Reflect on Your Strategy

Before comparing your approach with peers, take a few minutes to articulate your Revenue Empire Builder strategy.

**Talk through your decisions with the Strategy Reflection Coach.** The coach will ask you about:
- Your revenue priorities and overall approach
- The main trade-off you made
- What market assumptions drove your strategy
- The biggest risk in your approach

**This is reflection, not evaluation.** There's no right answer—the goal is to clearly articulate your thinking so you can explain it to peers and apply it to your CFL project.

**Time:** 5-8 minutes (4-5 exchanges)

**Tip:** Start by describing your top 2 revenue priorities and why you chose them.
```

---

### Success Indicators

Students successfully complete this element when they can:
- ✅ Articulate their top revenue priorities with reasoning
- ✅ Identify a specific trade-off they made
- ✅ Describe the market conditions their strategy assumes
- ✅ Acknowledge at least one risk in their approach

**Assessment Type:** Formative (not graded) - prepares students for peer discussion

# How Do Real Teams Approach Revenue Strategy?

Your simulation forced you to make choices. Real sports executives face the same dilemmas—and they've landed on very different answers.

Let's look at how actual franchises balance their revenue streams, and what market conditions drive their strategies.

Use the **Strategy Comparison Tool** below to see how your allocation compares to different team archetypes. Then explore the real-world examples to understand why these teams made the choices they did.
```

---

## Element 7: Details - Real-World Examples

**Accordion Title:** Real-World Examples: How Actual Teams Balance Revenue Streams

```markdown
## Dallas Cowboys: The Commercial Maximizer

The Cowboys generate more revenue than any NFL franchise (~$1.1 billion annually) despite not winning a Super Bowl since 1996. How?

**Strategy:** Maximize every commercial opportunity
- **AT&T Stadium:** $1.3B venue they own outright, capturing 100% of game-day and non-game revenue
- **Sponsorship:** 200+ corporate partners, including unprecedented stadium naming rights
- **Merchandising:** Consistently #1 in NFL merchandise sales globally
- **Media:** Primetime games, "America's Team" brand commands premium advertising

**Why it works:** Dallas is a massive market (4th largest metro), the Cowboys brand transcends local geography, and Jerry Jones owns the stadium. They can monetize everything.

**Trade-off:** Fan criticism of commercialization; tension between revenue optimization and "authenticity"

---

## Green Bay Packers: The Community Anchor

The only publicly-owned franchise in major North American sports, the Packers prioritize community connection over commercial maximization.

**Strategy:** Fan experience and tradition first
- **Stock sales:** Community ownership creates intense loyalty (but no dividends)
- **Ticket pricing:** Below-market prices; waitlist is 100,000+ people over 30 years
- **Sponsorship:** Selective partnerships that fit brand values
- **Lambeau Field:** Historic venue drives tourism ($290M annual economic impact)

**Why it works:** Green Bay is the smallest market in major pro sports, but fanatical fans and national brand ("Frozen Tundra," "Titletown") create sustainable revenue through media and merchandise.

**Trade-off:** Lower per-game revenue than possible; can't relocate or threaten relocation for stadium leverage

---

## Vegas Golden Knights: The Growth Gambler

Expansion franchise (2017) that immediately became one of the most valuable in the NHL.

**Strategy:** Entertainment-first, bet on emerging streams
- **In-game experience:** Vegas-style production, medieval knight theme, pre-game shows
- **Betting integration:** First major pro team in legal sports betting capital
- **Premium seating:** High percentage of luxury/premium tickets (Vegas corporate/tourist market)
- **Merchandise:** Expansion = everyone needs gear; top seller for years

**Why it works:** Vegas has no established sports loyalties, massive tourist flow, legal betting infrastructure, and entertainment-industry mindset.

**Trade-off:** Unproven long-term fan sustainability; reliant on novelty and tourism
```

## Element 8: Discussion - Peer Strategy Exchange

**Uplimit Discussion Configuration:**

**Prompt:**

```markdown
### Peer Strategy Exchange

Your Revenue Empire Builder strategy reflects your assumptions about what works in sports business. Now let's see what happens when different strategies collide.

**Your Task:**

1. **Share your strategy summary** (from the Reflection Tool):
   - Your top 2 revenue priorities
   - The market type your strategy targets
   - Your one-sentence revenue philosophy

2. **Find a classmate with a DIFFERENT approach** and reply to their post:
   - What did they prioritize that you didn't?
   - What market conditions would make THEIR strategy outperform yours?
   - What's one thing you'd "steal" from their approach?

3. **Respond to someone who commented on YOUR strategy:**
   - Did their feedback change how you think about your approach?
   - What would you adjust if you ran the simulation again?

**Post length:** 150-200 words initial post, 75-100 words per reply

**Example opening:**
> "My strategy prioritized media rights (45%) and sponsorship (25%), targeting a large-market team with strong corporate presence. My philosophy: 'Build the brand nationally, monetize locally.' I assumed consistent media rights growth and Fortune 500 headquarters nearby. The biggest risk? Media rights bubble bursting—I'm exposed if streaming economics shift..."
```

**Discussion Settings:**
- Require initial post before viewing others
- Minimum 1 reply required
- Instructor participation encouraged but not required

### UPLIMIT CONFIGURATION

**System Prompt:**

```
You are a friendly sports business advisor helping an MBA student think through their revenue strategy decisions. The student has just completed a Revenue Empire Builder simulation and is reflecting on their choices.

YOUR ROLE:
- Supportive and curious, not evaluative or testing
- Help them think through implications of their choices
- Ask clarifying questions to deepen their reflection
- Offer real-world examples when relevant
- Never say their strategy is "wrong"—instead, explore contexts where it would/wouldn't work

CONVERSATION STARTERS (if student seems unsure):
- "Tell me about your biggest revenue priority. What drew you to that approach?"
- "What market were you imagining when you built your strategy?"
- "What trade-off was hardest for you to make?"

TOPICS YOU CAN DISCUSS:
- Revenue stream trade-offs
- Market size and its impact on strategy
- Risk tolerance in sports business
- Real-world team examples (Cowboys, Packers, etc.)
- How their strategy might apply to CFL expansion project

WHAT TO AVOID:

## Element 10: CFL Bridge - Connecting to Anchor Project

**Copy this markdown directly into Uplimit:**

```markdown
# Connecting to Your CFL Expansion Project

Everything you've explored this week—the five revenue streams, the trade-offs, the market-dependent strategies—comes together in your Anchor Project: building a revenue strategy for a CFL expansion franchise.

**Your CFL city will face the same questions you just wrestled with:**

- **What's your market size?** A Toronto expansion plays differently than Halifax or Saskatoon.
- **Who's your competition?** Are you the only game in town, or fighting for attention?
- **What's your venue situation?** Building new? Sharing? What does that mean for revenue capture?
- **What's your fanbase like?** Established CFL culture? Or building from scratch?

**The strategy that worked in your simulation may or may not fit your CFL city.** That's the challenge—and the opportunity.

In the coming weeks, you'll apply these frameworks to a real market analysis. The revenue philosophy you articulated today? Keep it in mind. You might need to defend it—or change it—once you dig into your city's specifics.

**Up Next:** Week 1 Assessment—demonstrate your understanding of revenue streams and strategic trade-offs before moving into media rights and content strategy in Week 2.
