# Examining Your Revenue Strategy

You've just built a revenue strategy for your franchise in the Revenue Empire Builder. You made dozens of decisions—how much to invest in media rights, whether to push dynamic pricing, how aggressively to pursue sponsorships, and how to balance short-term revenue against long-term growth.

But here's the thing: **there's no single "correct" strategy.**

The Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers are both wildly successful franchises—with completely different revenue models. The Cowboys maximize every commercial opportunity; the Packers prioritize community ownership and fan experience. Both work. Both are defensible. Both reflect different assumptions about what success looks like.

In this module, you'll:
- **Examine your choices** and the trade-offs you made
- **Compare your strategy** to real-world team archetypes
- **Discuss with peers** who made different decisions
- **Connect your thinking** to your upcoming CFL expansion project

The goal isn't to find out if you were "right"—it's to understand *why* you made the choices you did and what market conditions would make your strategy succeed.

## Element 3: Infobox - No Right Answer

**Uplimit Callout Configuration:**
- **Variant:** Blue (informational)
- **Title:** Why Revenue Strategy Is Context-Dependent

```
There's no universal "best" revenue mix. The optimal strategy depends on:

**Market Size**
New York teams can command premium sponsorships that small-market teams cannot. A strategy built on corporate partnerships works in Dallas; it may fail in Green Bay.

**Fan Culture**
Some fanbases prioritize tradition and authenticity over commercial optimization. Others embrace entertainment-first experiences. Your pricing and sponsorship strategies must align with fan expectations.

**Arena/Stadium Situation**
Teams that own their venues capture 100% of ancillary revenue. Teams in leased facilities may see 40% go to landlords. This fundamentally changes which revenue streams matter most.

**Competitive Landscape**
The only major league team in town can price aggressively. A team competing with 3-4 other pro franchises for entertainment dollars needs different tactics.

**Owner Objectives**
Some owners optimize for profit. Others prioritize championships (spending on players over facilities). Some want civic legacy. Your strategy should reflect ownership goals.

**Your simulation strategy isn't right or wrong—it reflects assumptions about your market. The question is: can you articulate and defend those assumptions?**

# How Do Real Teams Approach Revenue Strategy?

Your simulation forced you to make choices. Real sports executives face the same dilemmas—and they've landed on very different answers.

Let's look at how actual franchises balance their revenue streams, and what market conditions drive their strategies.

Use the **Strategy Comparison Tool** below to see how your allocation compares to different team archetypes. Then explore the real-world examples to understand why these teams made the choices they did.

## Element 7: Details - Real-World Examples

**Accordion Title:** Real-World Examples: How Actual Teams Balance Revenue Streams

```markdown
## Dallas Cowboys: The Commercial Maximizer

The Cowboys generate more revenue than any NFL franchise (~$1.1 billion annually) despite not winning a Super Bowl since 1996. How?

**Strategy:** Maximize every commercial opportunity
- **AT&T Stadium:** $1.3B venue they own outright, capturing 100% of game-day and non-game revenue
- **Sponsorship:** 200+ corporate partners, including unprecedented stadium naming rights
- **Merchandising:** Consistently #1 in NFL merchandise sales globally
- **Media:** Primetime games, "America's Team" brand commands premium advertising

**Why it works:** Dallas is a massive market (4th largest metro), the Cowboys brand transcends local geography, and Jerry Jones owns the stadium. They can monetize everything.

**Trade-off:** Fan criticism of commercialization; tension between revenue optimization and "authenticity"

---

## Green Bay Packers: The Community Anchor

The only publicly-owned franchise in major North American sports, the Packers prioritize community connection over commercial maximization.

**Strategy:** Fan experience and tradition first
- **Stock sales:** Community ownership creates intense loyalty (but no dividends)
- **Ticket pricing:** Below-market prices; waitlist is 100,000+ people over 30 years
- **Sponsorship:** Selective partnerships that fit brand values
- **Lambeau Field:** Historic venue drives tourism ($290M annual economic impact)

**Why it works:** Green Bay is the smallest market in major pro sports, but fanatical fans and national brand ("Frozen Tundra," "Titletown") create sustainable revenue through media and merchandise.

**Trade-off:** Lower per-game revenue than possible; can't relocate or threaten relocation for stadium leverage

---

## Vegas Golden Knights: The Growth Gambler

Expansion franchise (2017) that immediately became one of the most valuable in the NHL.

**Strategy:** Entertainment-first, bet on emerging streams
- **In-game experience:** Vegas-style production, medieval knight theme, pre-game shows
- **Betting integration:** First major pro team in legal sports betting capital
- **Premium seating:** High percentage of luxury/premium tickets (Vegas corporate/tourist market)
- **Merchandise:** Expansion = everyone needs gear; top seller for years

**Why it works:** Vegas has no established sports loyalties, massive tourist flow, legal betting infrastructure, and entertainment-industry mindset.

**Trade-off:** Unproven long-term fan sustainability; reliant on novelty and tourism
```

## Element 8: Discussion - Peer Strategy Exchange

**Uplimit Discussion Configuration:**

**Prompt:**

```markdown
### Peer Strategy Exchange

Your Revenue Empire Builder strategy reflects your assumptions about what works in sports business. Now let's see what happens when different strategies collide.

**Your Task:**

1. **Share your strategy summary** (from the Reflection Tool):
   - Your top 2 revenue priorities
   - The market type your strategy targets
   - Your one-sentence revenue philosophy

2. **Find a classmate with a DIFFERENT approach** and reply to their post:
   - What did they prioritize that you didn't?
   - What market conditions would make THEIR strategy outperform yours?
   - What's one thing you'd "steal" from their approach?

3. **Respond to someone who commented on YOUR strategy:**
   - Did their feedback change how you think about your approach?
   - What would you adjust if you ran the simulation again?

**Post length:** 150-200 words initial post, 75-100 words per reply

**Example opening:**
> "My strategy prioritized media rights (45%) and sponsorship (25%), targeting a large-market team with strong corporate presence. My philosophy: 'Build the brand nationally, monetize locally.' I assumed consistent media rights growth and Fortune 500 headquarters nearby. The biggest risk? Media rights bubble bursting—I'm exposed if streaming economics shift..."
```

**Discussion Settings:**
- Require initial post before viewing others
- Minimum 1 reply required
- Instructor participation encouraged but not required

## Element 9: AI Chat Widget - Strategy Advisor (Optional)

**Widget Purpose:** Supportive AI conversation where students can ask questions about their revenue strategy and get constructive feedback. Lower stakes than the ownership pitch roleplay in the original module.

**Widget Status:** ⭕ Needs configuration in Uplimit platform

**Element Type:** AI Chat (NOT Roleplay - more conversational)

---

### UPLIMIT CONFIGURATION

**System Prompt:**

```
You are a friendly sports business advisor helping an MBA student think through their revenue strategy decisions. The student has just completed a Revenue Empire Builder simulation and is reflecting on their choices.

YOUR ROLE:
- Supportive and curious, not evaluative or testing
- Help them think through implications of their choices
- Ask clarifying questions to deepen their reflection
- Offer real-world examples when relevant
- Never say their strategy is "wrong"—instead, explore contexts where it would/wouldn't work

CONVERSATION STARTERS (if student seems unsure):
- "Tell me about your biggest revenue priority. What drew you to that approach?"
- "What market were you imagining when you built your strategy?"
- "What trade-off was hardest for you to make?"

TOPICS YOU CAN DISCUSS:
- Revenue stream trade-offs
- Market size and its impact on strategy
- Risk tolerance in sports business
- Real-world team examples (Cowboys, Packers, etc.)
- How their strategy might apply to CFL expansion project

WHAT TO AVOID:
- Grading or scoring their strategy
- Saying any choice was "wrong"
- Providing the "correct" answer
- Going beyond 4-5 exchanges (guide them to wrap up)

END THE CONVERSATION:
After 4-5 substantive exchanges, say something like: "Great reflection! You've clearly thought through your approach. As you head into the CFL expansion project, keep these trade-offs in mind—the market you choose will determine which of these strategies makes sense."
```

**Student Instructions:**

```markdown
### Strategy Advisor (Optional)

Want to talk through your revenue strategy? This AI advisor can help you:
- Explore the implications of your choices
- Think through how your strategy would work in different markets
- Prepare for applying these concepts to your CFL expansion project

This is a **low-stakes conversation**—there's no grade, no "right answer." Just a chance to think out loud with a knowledgeable advisor.

**Suggested conversation starters:**
- "I prioritized [X] in my strategy. What are the risks of that approach?"
- "My strategy assumes a large market. What would I need to change for a small market?"
- "I'm not sure if I balanced growth and stability well. Can you help me think through that?"
```

# Connecting to Your CFL Expansion Project

Everything you've explored this week—the five revenue streams, the trade-offs, the market-dependent strategies—comes together in your Anchor Project: building a revenue strategy for a CFL expansion franchise.

**Your CFL city will face the same questions you just wrestled with:**

- **What's your market size?** A Toronto expansion plays differently than Halifax or Saskatoon.
- **Who's your competition?** Are you the only game in town, or fighting for attention?
- **What's your venue situation?** Building new? Sharing? What does that mean for revenue capture?
- **What's your fanbase like?** Established CFL culture? Or building from scratch?

**The strategy that worked in your simulation may or may not fit your CFL city.** That's the challenge—and the opportunity.

In the coming weeks, you'll apply these frameworks to a real market analysis. The revenue philosophy you articulated today? Keep it in mind. You might need to defend it—or change it—once you dig into your city's specifics.

**Up Next:** Week 1 Assessment—demonstrate your understanding of revenue streams and strategic trade-offs before moving into media rights and content strategy in Week 2.
