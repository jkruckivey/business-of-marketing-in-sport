### Element 2: AI Roleplay Exercise - Private Equity Practice Pitch

**Exercise Title:** "Private Equity Investment Pitch: Revenue Ecosystem Recommendation"

**Student Instructions:**
```markdown
## Your Role
You are a sports business consultant advising a private equity firm (Brookfield Capital) that's considering investing in a mid-market professional sports team. Before you submit your written memo, you'll present your investment recommendation orally to the Managing Partner.

## The Scenario
Sarah Chen, Managing Partner at Brookfield Capital, has asked you to present your findings on sports revenue ecosystems. She's evaluating whether to invest $500M-$1B in acquiring a team. This conversation happens BEFORE you write your final memoâ€”it's your chance to test your arguments, receive feedback, and refine your thinking.

Sarah is sophisticated but not a sports expert. She needs you to explain:
- Why sports teams are unique investment opportunities (or risks)
- Which revenue streams offer growth potential and which are saturated
- The 2-3 factors that would most influence her investment decision
- Whether revenue sharing models help or hurt potential returns

## What to Have Ready
Before starting this conversation, organize your thoughts on:
- **The unique characteristics** of sport's revenue model (vs. traditional businesses)
- **3 revenue streams you'll analyze** (e.g., media rights, ticketing, betting)
- **2-3 investment factors** you'll recommend Sarah prioritize (e.g., "market size," "revenue sharing terms," "emerging stream potential")
- **Evidence from the week**: Executive session insights, Canucks case data, Revenue Empire Builder lessons

## Key Questions to Prepare For
1. "Explain how sports revenue works differently than a hotel chain or restaurant group"
2. "Which revenue stream has the most upside, and which is hitting a ceiling?"
3. "Should I be worried about revenue sharing eating into returns?"
4. "What are the 2-3 factors I should prioritize in my investment decision?"

## Your Goal
This is a rehearsal for your written memo. Use this conversation to:
1. **Test your arguments**: See if your logic holds up under questioning
2. **Refine your thinking**: Sarah will challenge weak pointsâ€”listen and adjust
3. **Practice executive communication**: Be concise, data-driven, and confident
4. **Get feedback**: AI will provide rubric-aligned feedback you can use to improve your memo

**Time:** 10-15 minutes | This is formative practice (not graded), but feedback will help you write a stronger memo.
```

**AI Character:** Sarah Chen, Managing Partner at Brookfield Capital (experienced private equity investor, data-driven, asks probing questions, no sports industry experience)

**System Prompt:**
```
You are Sarah Chen, Managing Partner at Brookfield Capital, a private equity firm. You're evaluating whether to invest $500M-$1B in acquiring a mid-market professional sports team. You've hired a sports business consultant to advise you on revenue ecosystems.

BACKGROUND: You're a seasoned PE investor with 15 years of experience in traditional industries (hospitality, real estate, retail). You understand business fundamentals but NOT sports-specific nuances. You're skeptical of "sports is different" claims unless backed by data. You ask tough, clarifying questions to test the consultant's expertise.

CONVERSATION STRUCTURE:
1. Opening (2 min): "Walk me through how sports revenue works. Why should I think about it differently than other businesses?"
2. Revenue Streams (4-6 min): "Talk me through 3 revenue streams. Where's the growth? Where are the limits?"
3. Investment Factors (3-4 min): "If you could only give me 2-3 factors to prioritize in my decision, what would they be and why?"
4. Challenges (2 min): "What am I not seeing? What concerns should I have about this investment?"
5. Closing (1 min): "Bottom line: Would you recommend I invest, and why?"

EVIDENCE OF STRONG PERFORMANCE (reward these):
- Clear explanation of sport's unique characteristics (ecosystem thinking, competitive balance, uncertainty of outcome)
- Specific revenue stream analysis with growth projections and risks
- Data-driven investment factors: "Media rights are 50% of revenue, but streaming disruption creates risk..."
- Application of case evidence: "The Canucks case shows how revenue sharing protects downside risk..."
- Executive communication: Concise, confident, uses analogies for complex concepts

PROVIDE CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK:
- If vague: "That's interesting, but can you be more specific? What's the data?"
- If jargon-heavy: "I'm not familiar with that termâ€”can you explain it in plain language?"
- If missing evidence: "How do you know that? What's your source?"
- If strong: "That's a compelling point. Tell me more about [specific aspect]..."

After 10-15 minutes, provide rubric-aligned feedback:
- Clarity of revenue ecosystem explanation (How well did they explain sport's unique model?)
- Quality of revenue stream analysis (Did they identify growth potential and risks?)
- Strength of investment factors (Were their recommendations specific and defensible?)
- Executive communication (Were they concise, confident, and data-driven?)

Frame feedback as: "Here's what worked well... Here's where you can strengthen your written memo..."
```

**Rubric:**
| **Criterion** | **Feedback Focus** | **What to Look For** |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Revenue Ecosystem Explanation** | Clarity & Depth | Did they explain how sport revenue differs from traditional business? (interdependence, competitive balance, shared economics) |
| **Revenue Stream Analysis** | Specificity & Balance | Did they analyze 3 streams with growth potential AND risks? Used data/percentages? Showed trade-offs? |
| **Investment Factors** | Actionable & Defensible | Were their 2-3 factors specific (not vague)? Backed by evidence? Framed as prioritization for investment decision? |
| **Executive Communication** | Conciseness & Confidence | Were they concise (no rambling)? Used data to support claims? Handled challenges professionally? |

**Note:** This is formative feedback (not graded). Students should use AI insights to strengthen their written memo before submission.

Upload your 80% complete draft to the shared Google Drive folder:
- **Format:** Google Doc (enable "Commenting" permissions)
- **Filename:** `YourLastName_ReflectionMemo_Draft.docx`
- **Completeness:** Must have all major sections (not rough notes)

**Draft Requirements:**
- Revenue stream analysis (at least 3 streams)
- Investment factors (2-3 specific recommendations)
- Evidence from course content
- Memo format (To/From/Date/Re)
- 400-500 words (can expand to 500 in revision)

---

## Step 2A: Peer Review (Due: [Date] by 11:59 PM)

You've been paired with a classmate (check announcement for your partner). Complete the structured peer review form for your partner's draft.

**Access Peer Review Form:** [Link to Google Form or PDF]

**Review Focus:**
1. **Revenue Stream Analysis** (10 pts): Are 3+ streams analyzed? Do they show interdependencies?
2. **Investment Factors** (10 pts): Are 2-3 factors specific and well-justified?
3. **Application of Concepts** (5 pts): Do they reference executive session, readings, Canucks case?
4. **Business Communication** (5 pts): Professional format? Clear? Within word limit?

**Time Estimate:** 20-30 minutes

**Reminder:** Be constructive and specific. Your goal is to help your peer improve their work.

---

## Step 2B: AI Feedback (Due: [Date] by 11:59 PM)

Use an AI writing assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini) to get feedback on the same draft you submitted for peer review.

### AI Feedback Prompt Template

**Copy this prompt into your AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.):**

3. Take screenshots showing the AI conversation (for your reflection)

**Time Estimate:** 5-10 minutes

---

## Step 3: Comparative Reflection (Due: [Date] by 11:59 PM)

Now that you have feedback from BOTH sources, critically compare them.

**Answer these questions in 150-200 words:**

### Question 1: Feedback Quality Comparison
- What did your peer reviewer notice that the AI missed?
- What did the AI notice that your peer missed?
- Were there areas where they disagreed? Which feedback seemed more accurate?

### Question 2: Strengths and Limitations
**Peer Feedback:**
- Strength: [What was most valuable about peer feedback?]
- Limitation: [What was missing or unclear?]

**AI Feedback:**
- Strength: [What was most valuable about AI feedback?]
- Limitation: [What was inaccurate or generic?]

### Question 3: Application Strategy
- Which feedback will you prioritize in your revision? Why?
- What criteria are you using to decide which suggestions to implement?
- How does this exercise change how you'll use AI in future writing tasks?

**Submit your reflection here:** [Link to submission box]

---

## Step 4: Revise Your Memo (Days 7-8)

Apply the insights from BOTH feedback sources:

**Revision Checklist:**
- [ ] Addressed peer feedback on revenue stream analysis
- [ ] Addressed AI feedback on business communication
- [ ] Evaluated competing suggestions and chose best approach
- [ ] Maintained executive memo format and tone
- [ ] Stayed within 500-word limit
- [ ] Cited course content appropriately

**Tip:** You are NOT required to implement ALL suggestions. Use your judgment to prioritize changes that most improve your argument.

---

## Step 5: Post-Revision Reflection (Submit with final memo)

After revising your memo, complete this brief reflection (100 words):

**Prompt:**
"Which feedback source (peer or AI) had the most influence on your revisions? Give 1-2 specific examples of changes you made based on each source. Did the comparative reflection process help you make better revision decisions than you would have with a single feedback source?"

**Format:** Include this reflection as an addendum to your final memo submission (does not count toward 500-word limit).

---

## Grading

**Final Memo:** 30 points (evaluated using original rubric criteria)

**PAIRR Participation Bonus:** Up to 5 bonus points
- Completed peer review form: 2 points
- Obtained AI feedback (verified by screenshot): 1 point
- Completed comparative reflection: 1 point
- Completed post-revision reflection: 1 point

**Total Possible:** 35 points (30 base + 5 bonus)

## Why PAIRR?

**Prepares you for AI-integrated workplaces:**
Sports marketing professionals increasingly use AI tools for content creation, fan engagement analysis, and campaign optimization. This exercise teaches you to:
- Leverage AI for writing improvement (not replacement)
- Critically evaluate AI output (it's not always right!)
- Combine human insight with AI efficiency
- Maintain your voice and strategic thinking

**Benefits you'll experience:**
1. **Multiple perspectives:** Peer sees reader experience; AI sees technical patterns
2. **Critical thinking:** You decide what feedback is valid (not blindly accepting)
3. **Better writing:** Two sources catch more issues than one
4. **Workplace readiness:** Practice balancing AI assistance with human judgment

**Research shows:** Students who use PAIRR write stronger final drafts than those who receive only peer feedback OR only AI feedback. The comparative reflection is the keyâ€”it develops your evaluation skills.

### Element 4: Details - Rubric Examples Content
```
Title: Rubric Details & Example Excerpts

[Expand to see evaluation criteria and examples]

## Revenue Stream Analysis (10 points)

**Excellent (9-10 pts):**
"Demonstrates sophisticated understanding of at least 3 revenue streams, explaining
not just what they are but how they interconnect. For example, shows how media
rights value depends on competitive talent, which requires revenue sharing to
maintain balance."

**Example Excerpt:**
"Media rights generate 55% of NHL revenue, but this value depends entirely on
competitive balance maintained through revenue sharing. Without sharing, wealthy
teams would monopolize talent, creating predictable outcomes that decrease media
value for all. The Canucks benefit from shared national media revenue ($XX million)
but must compete for scarce local sponsorship dollars..."

**Proficient (7-8 pts):**
"Accurately describes 3+ revenue streams with some analysis of characteristics.
May miss some interdependencies or deeper implications."

**Developing (5-6 pts):**
"Lists revenue streams but provides limited analysis. May treat streams as
independent rather than interconnected."

**Needs Improvement (0-4 pts):**
"Describes fewer than 3 streams, or descriptions are inaccurate or incomplete."

---

## Investment Factors (10 points)

**Excellent (9-10 pts):**
"Identifies 2-3 specific, defensible investment factors supported by evidence.
Factors show strategic thinking and business acumen."

**Example Excerpt:**
"Two factors would drive my investment decision: (1) Revenue sharing stabilityâ€”
leagues with proven revenue sharing models (like the NFL) protect downside risk,
and (2) Emerging stream potentialâ€”teams with rights to betting partnerships and
digital content can capture high-growth revenue outside traditional sharing pools."

**Proficient (7-8 pts):**
"Identifies 2-3 reasonable factors with some justification. May lack specificity
or deep supporting evidence."
