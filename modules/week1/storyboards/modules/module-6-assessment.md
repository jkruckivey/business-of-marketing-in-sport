### Element 1: Connecting Introduction Text
**Copy this markdown directly into Uplimit:**

```markdown
You've explored revenue streams through interactive discovery in Module 3, built a five-year strategy in Module 4, and analyzed the Vancouver Canucks' real-world challenges in Module 5. You've seen how revenue ecosystems work in theory and in practice.

Now it's time to demonstrate what you've learned. In this final assessment, you'll step into the role of a strategic advisor to a private equity firm considering a major investment in professional sports. They need to understand whether sports teams operate like other businesses—and if not, what makes them different. Your task: write a clear, evidence-based executive memo that synthesizes everything you've learned this week into actionable investment guidance.
```

### Element 2: Infobox Content

```
Title: ▪ Assessment: Revenue Ecosystem Reflection Memo

You'll write a 1-page executive memo advising a private equity firm considering investing in a professional sports team. Your memo should explain the unique characteristics of sport's revenue model and identify 2-3 factors that would influence their investment decision. This assessment measures WLOs 1.1-1.4 and is worth 30 points. Use the rubric below to guide your work.

### Element 3: AI Roleplay - Private Equity Practice Pitch

**🎮 Widget Purpose:** Formative practice where students rehearse their investment recommendation before writing the final memo, receiving AI feedback to strengthen their arguments and executive communication.

**Widget Status:** ⭕ Needs configuration in Uplimit platform

**Element Type:** AI Roleplay (4-tab configuration)

---

## UPLIMIT CONFIGURATION

### Tab 1: Learning Objective

**Name:** Private Equity Investment Pitch: Revenue Ecosystem Recommendation

**Learning Objective:**
Students will practice articulating revenue ecosystem analysis and investment recommendations in professional conversation, testing their arguments and receiving formative feedback before writing their final memo. This supports WLOs 1.1-1.4 (Analysis level) while developing executive communication skills.

**Scenario Setup:**
Formative practice conversation (not graded)

---

### Tab 2: Scenario

**Context:**
Brookfield Capital, a private equity firm, is considering investing $500M-$1B in acquiring a mid-market professional sports team. The firm's Managing Partner, Sarah Chen, has hired a sports business consultant to advise on the investment opportunity. The learner will present findings on sports revenue ecosystems, explaining why sports teams represent unique investment opportunities (or risks), identifying which revenue streams offer growth potential versus saturation, recommending 2-3 factors that would most influence the investment decision, and assessing whether revenue sharing models help or hurt potential returns. This is a formative practice conversation (not graded) designed to help the learner rehearse their arguments before writing a final memo.

**Role of AI (Sarah Chen):** Sarah Chen is the Managing Partner at Brookfield Capital with 15 years of private equity experience in traditional industries (hospitality, real estate, retail). She understands business fundamentals but not sports-specific nuances, and she is sophisticated, data-driven, and skeptical of "sports is different" claims unless backed by data.

**Role of Student:** The learner plays the role of a sports business consultant advising Brookfield Capital on revenue ecosystem analysis and investment recommendations.

---

### Tab 3: Hidden Context

**Hidden Context (AI knows, student doesn't see):**

**AI Character Personality:**
You are Sarah Chen, Managing Partner at Brookfield Capital with 15 years of private equity experience in traditional industries (hospitality, real estate, retail). You understand business fundamentals but NOT sports-specific nuances. You're sophisticated, data-driven, and skeptical of "sports is different" claims unless backed by data. You ask tough, clarifying questions to test the consultant's expertise.

**Key Constraints:**
- No sports industry experience—need concepts explained in business fundamentals language
- Evaluating $500M-$1B investment decision (high stakes, need confidence)
- Familiar with traditional PE metrics (IRR, cash flow, market size, competitive moats)
- Skeptical but open-minded—will be convinced by data and clear logic

**Conversation Strategy (5 Questions):**

1. **Opening:** "Walk me through how sports revenue works. Why should I think about it differently than other businesses?"
   - Test if they can explain ecosystem thinking, competitive balance, uncertainty of outcome

2. **Revenue Streams:** "Talk me through 3 revenue streams. Where's the growth? Where are the limits?"
   - Probe for specific analysis with growth projections and risks
   - Challenge vague statements: "Can you be more specific? What's the data?"

3. **Investment Factors:** "If you could only give me 2-3 factors to prioritize in my decision, what would they be and why?"
   - Test for actionable, defensible recommendations
   - Push for specificity: "How do you know that? What's your source?"

4. **Challenges:** "What am I not seeing? What concerns should I have about this investment?"
   - Test risk awareness and critical thinking
   - Respect candor about downsides

5. **Closing:** "Bottom line: Would you recommend I invest, and why?"
   - Allow final synthesis and recommendation

**Reward Strong Performance (use for evaluation):**
- ✅ Clear explanation of sport's unique characteristics (ecosystem thinking, competitive balance)
- ✅ Specific revenue stream analysis with growth projections and risks
- ✅ Data-driven investment factors: "Media rights are 50% of revenue, but streaming disruption creates risk..."
- ✅ Application of case evidence: "The Canucks case shows how revenue sharing protects downside risk..."
- ✅ Executive communication: Concise, confident, uses analogies for complex concepts

**Provide Constructive Feedback:**
- If vague: "That's interesting, but can you be more specific? What's the data?"
- If jargon-heavy: "I'm not familiar with that term—can you explain it in plain language?"
- If missing evidence: "How do you know that? What's your source?"
- If strong: "That's a compelling point. Tell me more about [specific aspect]..."

**After completing 5 questions:** Provide rubric-aligned feedback framed as: "Here's what worked well in your pitch... Here's where you can strengthen your written memo..."

---

## Step 3: Comparative Reflection (Due: [Date] by 11:59 PM)

Now that you have feedback from BOTH sources, critically compare them.

**Answer these questions in 150-200 words:**

### Question 1: Feedback Quality Comparison
- What did your peer reviewer notice that the AI missed?
- What did the AI notice that your peer missed?
- Were there areas where they disagreed? Which feedback seemed more accurate?

### Question 2: Strengths and Limitations
**Peer Feedback:**
- Strength: [What was most valuable about peer feedback?]
- Limitation: [What was missing or unclear?]

**AI Feedback:**
- Strength: [What was most valuable about AI feedback?]
- Limitation: [What was inaccurate or generic?]

### Question 3: Application Strategy
- Which feedback will you prioritize in your revision? Why?
- What criteria are you using to decide which suggestions to implement?
- How does this exercise change how you'll use AI in future writing tasks?

**Submit your reflection here:** [Link to submission box]

---

## Step 4: Revise Your Memo (Days 7-8)

Apply the insights from BOTH feedback sources:

**Revision Checklist:**
- [ ] Addressed peer feedback on revenue stream analysis
- [ ] Addressed AI feedback on business communication
- [ ] Evaluated competing suggestions and chose best approach
- [ ] Maintained executive memo format and tone
- [ ] Stayed within 500-word limit
- [ ] Cited course content appropriately

**Tip:** You are NOT required to implement ALL suggestions. Use your judgment to prioritize changes that most improve your argument.

---

## Step 5: Post-Revision Reflection (Submit with final memo)

After revising your memo, complete this brief reflection (100 words):

**Prompt:**
"Which feedback source (peer or AI) had the most influence on your revisions? Give 1-2 specific examples of changes you made based on each source. Did the comparative reflection process help you make better revision decisions than you would have with a single feedback source?"

**Format:** Include this reflection as an addendum to your final memo submission (does not count toward 500-word limit).

---

### Element 6: Details - Rubric Examples Content
```
Title: Rubric Details & Example Excerpts

[Expand to see evaluation criteria and examples]

## Revenue Stream Analysis (10 points)

**Excellent (9-10 pts):**
"Demonstrates sophisticated understanding of at least 3 revenue streams, explaining
not just what they are but how they interconnect. For example, shows how media
rights value depends on competitive talent, which requires revenue sharing to
maintain balance."

**Example Excerpt:**
"Media rights generate 55% of NHL revenue, but this value depends entirely on
competitive balance maintained through revenue sharing. Without sharing, wealthy
teams would monopolize talent, creating predictable outcomes that decrease media
value for all. The Canucks benefit from shared national media revenue ($XX million)
but must compete for scarce local sponsorship dollars..."

**Proficient (7-8 pts):**
"Accurately describes 3+ revenue streams with some analysis of characteristics.
May miss some interdependencies or deeper implications."

**Developing (5-6 pts):**
"Lists revenue streams but provides limited analysis. May treat streams as
independent rather than interconnected."

**Needs Improvement (0-4 pts):**
"Describes fewer than 3 streams, or descriptions are inaccurate or incomplete."

---

## Investment Factors (10 points)

**Excellent (9-10 pts):**
"Identifies 2-3 specific, defensible investment factors supported by evidence.
Factors show strategic thinking and business acumen."

**Example Excerpt:**
"Two factors would drive my investment decision: (1) Revenue sharing stability—
leagues with proven revenue sharing models (like the NFL) protect downside risk,
and (2) Emerging stream potential—teams with rights to betting partnerships and
digital content can capture high-growth revenue outside traditional sharing pools."

**Proficient (7-8 pts):**
"Identifies 2-3 reasonable factors with some justification. May lack specificity
or deep supporting evidence."
