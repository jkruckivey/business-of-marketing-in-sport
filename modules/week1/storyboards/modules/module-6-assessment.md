# MODULE 6: Assessment - Revenue Ecosystem Reflection
**Version:** 3.0.0 | **Last Updated:** 2026-01-20

### Version 3.0.0 Changes
- **ALIGNED:** Assessment now matches simplified Module 5 (simulation debrief, not case study)
- **REDUCED:** From 40 points to 25 points (lighter assessment)
- **SIMPLIFIED:** 300-word reflection instead of 500-word memo
- **UPDATED:** Rubric references simulation experience, not Nashville case
- **REMOVED:** File upload - now text response

**Purpose:** Assess student understanding of Week 1 content (measures WLO 1.1-1.4)

**Uplimit Structure:** Sixth module in Unit 1

## Element 1: Connecting Introduction

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Text** element
2. Copy markdown below:

```markdown
## What Did You Learn?

You've explored revenue streams through interactive discovery, built a strategy in Build Your Revenue Empire, and reflected on what worked (and what didn't) in the simulation.

Now capture what you learned. This isn't about getting the "right answer"—it's about showing you understand how sports revenue ecosystems work.
```

## Element 2: Infobox - Assessment Overview

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Infobox** element
2. Choose variant: **Assessment** (purple)
3. Copy markdown below:

```markdown
Title: ▪ Assessment: Revenue Ecosystem Reflection (25 points)

**Your Task:** In 300 words or less, reflect on what you learned about sports revenue ecosystems.

**Your reflection should address:**

1. **The Big Picture** - What makes sports revenue different from other businesses?
2. **Interdependencies** - How do revenue streams connect to each other? Give one example.
3. **Your Strategy** - What worked in your simulation? What would you do differently?

**Grading (25 points):**
- Revenue ecosystem understanding (10 pts)
- Interdependency example (8 pts)
- Strategic reflection (7 pts)

**Tip:** Be specific. "Media drives everything" is vague. "Media rights fund player salaries, which drive on-field success, which increases ticket demand" shows ecosystem thinking.
```

## Element 3: Text Response - Revenue Ecosystem Reflection

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Exercise → Text Response Question**
2. Configure the following fields:

**Question:**
```
What did you learn about sports revenue ecosystems? Reflect in 300 words or less.
```

**Additional Instructions:**
```
Your response will be evaluated on:

**Revenue Ecosystem Understanding (10 pts)**
- Explains what makes sports revenue unique (not like traditional businesses)
- Shows understanding of the five revenue streams
- Demonstrates "ecosystem thinking" (not just listing streams)

**Interdependency Example (8 pts)**
- Provides a specific example of how streams connect
- Shows cause-and-effect relationship
- Example: "Winning increases ticket demand, which increases sponsorship value, which funds better players..."

**Strategic Reflection (7 pts)**
- Reflects honestly on simulation experience
- Identifies what worked and what didn't
- Shows learning from the experience (not just describing what happened)

**Reference your simulation:**
- What strategy did you try?
- What surprised you about the results?
- What would you do differently next time?
```

**AI Feedback Prompt:**
```
Evaluate this revenue ecosystem reflection. Check for:
1. Do they understand what makes sports revenue unique?
2. Did they provide a specific interdependency example (not vague)?
3. Did they reflect on their simulation experience (not just describe it)?

Provide brief, encouraging feedback. If their interdependency example is vague, ask for more specifics.
```

**Rubric Configuration:**

---

**CRITERION 1: Revenue Ecosystem Understanding**

**Points:** 10

**Does not meet expectations (0-3 pts):**
Lists revenue streams without explaining what makes sports unique. No ecosystem thinking—treats streams as independent.

**Partially meets expectations (4-6 pts):**
Shows some understanding of sports revenue characteristics. May mention interdependencies but doesn't develop them fully.

**Fully meets expectations (7-10 pts):**
Clearly articulates what makes sports revenue unique (e.g., emotional fan attachment, media value of live content, league revenue sharing). Demonstrates ecosystem thinking—understands that streams reinforce each other.

---

**CRITERION 2: Interdependency Example**

**Points:** 8

**Does not meet expectations (0-2 pts):**
No specific example provided, or example is too vague to demonstrate understanding (e.g., "all streams are connected").

**Partially meets expectations (3-5 pts):**
Provides an example but doesn't fully develop the cause-and-effect chain. May only show two streams connecting, not the broader ecosystem.

**Fully meets expectations (6-8 pts):**
Provides a specific, well-developed example showing how multiple streams connect. Example: "My simulation showed that investing in player talent increased winning percentage, which drove 15% higher ticket sales, which made our sponsorship packages more valuable because brands wanted access to a winning team's engaged fans."

---

**CRITERION 3: Strategic Reflection**

**Points:** 7

**Does not meet expectations (0-2 pts):**
No reflection on simulation experience. Just describes what happened without learning insights.

**Partially meets expectations (3-4 pts):**
Some reflection present but surface-level. May say "I would do things differently" without specifying what or why.

**Fully meets expectations (5-7 pts):**
Honest, specific reflection on simulation experience. Identifies what worked, what surprised them, and what they'd change. Shows genuine learning—not just "I should have invested more in X" but explains the reasoning.

## Element 4: Infobox - What's Next

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Infobox** element
2. Choose variant: **Next Steps** (green)
3. Copy markdown below:

```
Title: ✓ What's Next: Module 7

**After submitting your reflection:**

Module 7 wraps up Week 1 with key takeaways and your first CFL Expansion Project milestone. You'll apply the revenue ecosystem frameworks to select an expansion city and project 5-year revenue.

**Coming Up:**
- Week 1 Key Takeaways (5 critical insights)
- CFL Expansion Milestone 1: Market Selection & Revenue Projections

Submit your reflection, then continue to Module 7.
```

## Instructor Notes

**Module 6 Purpose:**
- Assess Week 1 learning through reflection on simulation experience
- Lighter assessment aligned with simplified Module 5 (simulation debrief)
- Clean handoff to Module 7 (CFL Expansion milestone)

**Assessment Flow (Simplified Modules 5-6):**
1. Module 5: Students debrief their simulation, compare strategies with peers (~30-40 min)
2. Module 6: Students write 300-word reflection on what they learned (25 pts)

**Why Lighter Assessment:**
- Simplified Module 5 focuses on simulation debrief, not Nashville case analysis
- Assessment should match the learning investment
- 300 words is enough to demonstrate ecosystem understanding
- Reflection format encourages honest learning insights over "right answers"

**For Students Who Want More Challenge:**
Students who engaged deeply with the simulation can provide more detailed strategy analysis. The rubric rewards specificity—students who can explain *why* their strategy worked (or didn't) with specific numbers will score higher.

**Grading Notes:**
- Look for ecosystem thinking (interdependencies), not just stream listing
- The interdependency example is the key differentiator between surface and deep responses
- Accept any reasonable reflection on simulation strategy—no "right answer"
- Specific examples and numbers beat vague generalizations

**Alternative Formats:**
- Video response (90 seconds) acceptable for accessibility
- Screenshot of simulation results with brief explanation acceptable
