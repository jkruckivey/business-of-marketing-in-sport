### Element 1: Connecting Introduction Text
**Copy this markdown directly into Uplimit:**

```markdown
You've explored revenue streams through interactive discovery in Five Revenue Streams, built a five-year strategy in Build Your Revenue Empire, and analyzed the Vancouver Canucks' real-world challenges in The Canucks Challenge. You've seen how revenue ecosystems work in theory and in practice.

Now it's time to demonstrate what you've learned. In this final assessment, you'll step into the role of a strategic advisor to a private equity firm considering a major investment in professional sports. They need to understand whether sports teams operate like other businesses—and if not, what makes them different. Your task: write a clear, evidence-based executive memo that synthesizes everything you've learned this week into actionable investment guidance.
```

### Element 2: Infobox Content

```
Title: ▪ Assessment: Revenue Ecosystem Reflection Memo

You'll write a 1-page executive memo advising a private equity firm considering investing in a professional sports team. Your memo should explain the unique characteristics of sport's revenue model and identify 2-3 factors that would influence their investment decision. This assessment measures WLOs 1.1-1.4 and is worth 30 points. Use the rubric below to guide your work.

**VIDEO SCRIPT: "Writing Your Executive Memo - A Guided Walkthrough" (6 min)**

```
[0:00-0:30] INTRODUCTION

[Screen: Title slide "Writing Your Executive Memo: A Guided Walkthrough"]

NARRATOR: "Hi, I'm [Instructor Name]. In the next six minutes, I'm going to walk you through exactly how I would approach this executive memo assignment. I'll show you my thinking process—including the parts where I get stuck and have to revise. Let's write this together."

[Screen: Opens blank Word document]

---

[0:30-1:30] STEP 1: UNDERSTANDING THE PROMPT

[Screen: Assignment prompt visible on screen]

NARRATOR: "First, I always read the prompt twice. Let me highlight the key requirements..."

[Highlights on screen as narrator speaks]

"One-page memo... advising a private equity firm... unique characteristics of sport's revenue model... 2-3 investment decision factors. Okay, so I need to do TWO things: explain what makes sports different, AND give them actionable guidance."

[Opens rubric in split screen]

"Let me check the rubric... Revenue Stream Analysis is worth 10 points, Investment Factors is 10 points... So these are equally weighted. I shouldn't spend 80% of my memo on one and ignore the other."

[Types quick outline]

"I'm going to sketch a quick outline before I write:
- Opening: Set up the context (1-2 sentences)
- Section 1: How sports revenue is unique (150-200 words)
- Section 2: 2-3 factors for investment decision (150-200 words)
- Closing: Bottom-line recommendation (1-2 sentences)"

---

[1:30-3:00] STEP 2: WRITING THE ANALYSIS

[Screen: Starts typing memo format]

NARRATOR: "I'll start with the memo header—this is standard business format."

[Types: To: Brookfield Capital Investment Committee / From: [Name], Sports Business Consultant / Date: [Today] / Re: Sports Team Investment Analysis]

"Now the opening. I want to get straight to the point—executives don't want fluff."

[Types, speaking aloud]: "Professional sports teams operate under a fundamentally different economic model than traditional businesses. Before investing $500M-$1B, you need to understand three characteristics that make sports unique—and why they matter for your returns."

"See how I'm setting up expectations? They know I'm going to cover three things. Now let me deliver on that promise."

[Types Section 1, thinking aloud]

"First characteristic... I'll talk about revenue ecosystem interdependence. Let me pull data from the course..."

[Types]: "First, revenue streams are deeply interconnected. Media rights (55% of NHL revenue) depend on competitive balance, which requires revenue sharing among teams. This means individual team profitability is partially determined by league-wide policies, not just team management decisions."

"Good—I've made a claim AND supported it with a specific percentage from the course content. Let me add the Canucks example..."

[Continues typing, showing the process of drafting, pausing, checking notes]

---

[3:00-4:30] STEP 3: INVESTMENT FACTORS

NARRATOR: "Now for the investment factors section. The rubric says 'specific, defensible factors backed by evidence.' Let me think about what Sarah Chen—our PE investor—would actually care about..."

[Types, thinking aloud]

"If I were investing $500M, I'd want to know about downside protection AND upside potential. Let me frame it that way."

[Types]: "Two factors should guide your investment decision:

1. Revenue sharing structure: Leagues with robust sharing (NFL) protect downside risk. The Canucks case shows that even struggling teams receive $XX million in shared national media revenue, creating a floor on losses.

2. Emerging revenue exposure: Teams with rights to betting partnerships and digital content can capture high-growth revenue streams outside traditional sharing pools. These streams could represent 15-20% of revenue by 2030."

"Notice I'm being specific—not just 'look at revenue sharing' but explaining WHY it matters for an investor. And I'm citing the case."

---

[4:30-5:30] STEP 4: REVISION AND POLISH

[Screen: Shows full draft, ~400 words]

NARRATOR: "Okay, I have a draft. But I'm at 420 words and the limit is 500. Let me check if everything earns its place..."

[Scrolls through, highlighting sections]

"This sentence is redundant... delete. This phrase is wordy—'in order to' can just be 'to'... And here I said 'unique' twice in the same paragraph."

[Makes edits on screen]

"Now let me check against the rubric one more time. Revenue streams analyzed? Yes, I covered media rights and mentioned interdependencies. Investment factors? Yes, two specific factors with evidence. Business communication? Memo format, clear writing... looks good."

"One more thing—do I have a clear bottom-line recommendation?"

[Scrolls to end, adds closing]

"I'll add: 'Bottom line: Sports teams are not traditional businesses, but with proper due diligence on league revenue structures and emerging stream potential, they can deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns.'"

---

[5:30-6:00] CLOSING

NARRATOR: "That's it. Total time from blank page to finished draft: about 45 minutes for me, and that's with experience. Give yourself 60-90 minutes for your first draft, then use the PAIRR process to get feedback and revise."

"Key takeaways:
1. Read the prompt and rubric BEFORE writing
2. Make an outline to organize your thinking
3. Support every claim with specific evidence
4. Revise for concision—every word should earn its place
5. Check your draft against the rubric before submitting"

"Good luck with your memo. You've got this."

[End screen: "Ready to write? Try the AI Roleplay to practice your pitch first, or dive into your draft."]

**Content - Developing Draft (with 8 annotation hotspots):**

```markdown
**TO:** Investment Committee
**FROM:** Sports Consultant
**RE:** Sports Investment

[HOTSPOT 1: "Vague header - missing date, full titles"]

Professional sports teams are different from other businesses. [HOTSPOT 2: "Too vague - HOW are they different?"] They make money from several sources including media, tickets, sponsorship, merchandise, and betting.

The revenue streams are connected to each other. [HOTSPOT 3: "Claims without evidence - no data"] For example, media rights are important for teams. Revenue sharing also matters because it helps teams stay competitive.

If you invest, you should think about a few things. [HOTSPOT 4: "Weak transition - 'a few things' is vague"] First, look at how the league shares revenue. [HOTSPOT 5: "Generic advice - not specific to THIS investment"] Second, consider the growth potential. Third, think about the risks involved.

Overall, sports teams can be good investments but there are also risks to consider. [HOTSPOT 6: "Wishy-washy conclusion - no clear recommendation"] You should do more research before deciding. [HOTSPOT 7: "Passes the buck - they hired YOU for a recommendation"]

[HOTSPOT 8: "Missing word count indicator, no memo formatting polish"]

**Content - Exemplary Draft:**

```markdown
**TO:** Brookfield Capital Investment Committee
**FROM:** [Name], Sports Business Consultant
**DATE:** [Current Date]
**RE:** Professional Sports Team Investment Analysis: Revenue Model Assessment

Professional sports teams operate under a fundamentally different economic model than traditional businesses. Before committing $500M-$1B, you must understand three characteristics that create both opportunity and risk.

**1. Revenue Ecosystem Interdependence**
Unlike traditional businesses, sports revenue streams are deeply interconnected. Media rights (55% of NHL revenue) depend on competitive balance maintained through revenue sharing. The Vancouver Canucks case demonstrates this: despite market challenges, the team receives $XX million annually in shared national media revenue—a floor that protects downside risk regardless of on-ice performance.

**2. Shared Economics Create Unusual Incentives**
Sports teams must collaborate with competitors to maximize value. Strong league governance (salary caps, draft systems, revenue pools) correlates with franchise stability. Leagues with robust sharing—NFL distributes 63% of revenue equally—show lower variance in team valuations.

**Investment Decision Factors**

Two factors should guide your due diligence:

1. **Revenue sharing structure:** Prioritize leagues/teams where sharing protects downside. Calculate the "floor" revenue a team receives regardless of performance.

2. **Emerging stream exposure:** Evaluate the team's position in betting partnerships and digital content rights. These streams (projected 15-20% of revenue by 2030) sit outside traditional sharing pools, creating upside for first-movers.

**Recommendation:** Sports teams are not traditional businesses, but with proper due diligence on league revenue structures and emerging stream potential, they offer attractive risk-adjusted returns for patient capital. I recommend proceeding to Phase 2 due diligence on the shortlisted properties.

**Annotation Content (8 annotations):**

| # | Section | Annotation Text |
|---|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | Header | **What's missing:** Professional memos include full recipient/sender titles, specific date, and descriptive subject line. The exemplary version tells the reader exactly what this memo covers before they read it. |
| 2 | Opening claim | **Show, don't just tell:** "Different" is vague. The exemplary version specifies HOW they're different (interdependent revenue, shared economics) with a hook that promises three specific insights. |
| 3 | Unsupported claims | **Evidence matters:** Every claim needs support. Notice how the exemplary version cites "55% of NHL revenue" and references the Canucks case. Your reader is a data-driven PE investor—give them numbers. |
| 4 | Weak transition | **Signpost your structure:** "A few things" forces the reader to count. The exemplary version uses a clear header ("Investment Decision Factors") and numbers each factor explicitly. |
| 5 | Generic advice | **Be specific and actionable:** "Look at revenue sharing" is advice anyone could give. The exemplary version tells them exactly WHAT to look for: "Calculate the 'floor' revenue a team receives regardless of performance." |
| 6 | Weak conclusion | **Take a position:** Executives hire consultants to make recommendations, not hedge. The exemplary version gives a clear verdict: "I recommend proceeding to Phase 2 due diligence." |
| 7 | Deflection | **Own your expertise:** "Do more research" sounds like you're not confident in your analysis. If you need more information, specify exactly what data you need and why. Otherwise, make the call. |
| 8 | Missing polish | **Professional formatting matters:** Word count shows you respect the limit. Clean formatting (headers, bold, bullets) makes the memo scannable—executives skim before they read. |

**AUDIO SCRIPT: "Your Executive Memo Assignment - Audio Overview" (4 min)**

```
[0:00-0:30] INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the audio overview of your Week 1 Executive Memo assignment. This recording covers everything you need to know to succeed. Feel free to listen while you review the written instructions, or use this as a refresher before you start writing.

---

[0:30-1:15] THE ASSIGNMENT

Your task is to write a one-page executive memo—that's 500 words maximum—advising a private equity firm that's considering investing in a professional sports team.

Your memo needs to do two things. First, explain what makes sports teams different from traditional businesses. Think about what you learned about revenue ecosystems, competitive balance, and revenue sharing. Second, identify two to three factors that should influence their investment decision. These should be specific and evidence-based, not generic advice.

This assignment measures all four of this week's learning outcomes and is worth 30 points.

---

[1:15-2:00] HOW YOU'LL BE EVALUATED

The rubric has four criteria.

Revenue Stream Analysis is worth 10 points. You need to accurately describe at least three revenue streams and show how they're interconnected—not just list them separately.

Investment Factors is also worth 10 points. Identify two to three specific factors backed by evidence from the course content. Generic advice like "consider the risks" won't earn full credit.

Application of Concepts is worth 5 points. Reference the executive session, readings, and especially the Canucks case study.

Business Communication is worth 5 points. Use proper memo format, write clearly and concisely, and stay within the 500-word limit.

---

[2:00-2:45] RESOURCES TO HELP YOU

Before you start writing, you have several optional resources available.

The Guided Demo Video shows an instructor writing a memo from scratch, thinking aloud through the process. It's about six minutes and shows you what good looks like.

The Annotated Exemplar Explorer is an interactive tool that compares a developing draft to an exemplary draft. Click on highlighted sections to see what makes the difference.

The Micro-Tutorial Library has five short videos—one to two minutes each—on specific skills like writing executive summaries, citing evidence, and editing for concision. Pick the ones you need.

And of course, you're listening to the audio instructions right now.

---

[2:45-3:30] THE PROCESS

Here's the recommended workflow. First, use the AI Roleplay to practice your pitch. You'll have a conversation with Sarah Chen, a fictional PE investor, and get feedback on your arguments before you write.

Then write your first draft. Give yourself 60 to 90 minutes.

Next, use the PAIRR process. Get feedback from both a peer and an AI writing tool, compare the feedback, and revise.

Finally, submit your polished memo through the submission box.

The PAIRR feedback is optional but earns up to 5 bonus points—and research shows students who use it write stronger memos.

---

[3:30-4:00] CLOSING

That's everything you need to know. To summarize: one-page memo, 500 words max, explain what makes sports different, give two to three investment factors, use evidence from the course, and write in professional memo format.

You have all the tools. Now go write something great. Good luck!

### Element 3: AI Roleplay - Private Equity Practice Pitch

**🎮 Widget Purpose:** Formative practice where students rehearse their investment recommendation before writing the final memo, receiving AI feedback to strengthen their arguments and executive communication.

**Widget Status:** ⭕ Needs configuration in Uplimit platform

**Element Type:** AI Roleplay (4-tab configuration)

---

## UPLIMIT CONFIGURATION

### Tab 1: Learning Objective

**Name:** Private Equity Investment Pitch: Revenue Ecosystem Recommendation

**Learning Objective:**
Students will practice articulating revenue ecosystem analysis and investment recommendations in professional conversation, testing their arguments and receiving formative feedback before writing their final memo. This supports WLOs 1.1-1.4 (Analysis level) while developing executive communication skills.

**Scenario Setup:**
Formative practice conversation (not graded)

---

### Tab 2: Scenario

**Context:**
Brookfield Capital, a private equity firm, is considering investing $500M-$1B in acquiring a mid-market professional sports team. The firm's Managing Partner, Sarah Chen, has hired a sports business consultant to advise on the investment opportunity. The learner will present findings on sports revenue ecosystems, explaining why sports teams represent unique investment opportunities (or risks), identifying which revenue streams offer growth potential versus saturation, recommending 2-3 factors that would most influence the investment decision, and assessing whether revenue sharing models help or hurt potential returns. This is a formative practice conversation (not graded) designed to help the learner rehearse their arguments before writing a final memo.

**Role of AI (Sarah Chen):** Sarah Chen is the Managing Partner at Brookfield Capital with 15 years of private equity experience in traditional industries (hospitality, real estate, retail). She understands business fundamentals but not sports-specific nuances, and she is sophisticated, data-driven, and skeptical of "sports is different" claims unless backed by data.

**Role of Student:** The learner plays the role of a sports business consultant advising Brookfield Capital on revenue ecosystem analysis and investment recommendations.

---

### Tab 3: Hidden Context

**Hidden Context (AI knows, student doesn't see):**

**AI Character Personality:**
You are Sarah Chen, Managing Partner at Brookfield Capital with 15 years of private equity experience in traditional industries (hospitality, real estate, retail). You understand business fundamentals but NOT sports-specific nuances. You're sophisticated, data-driven, and skeptical of "sports is different" claims unless backed by data. You ask tough, clarifying questions to test the consultant's expertise.

**Key Constraints:**
- No sports industry experience—need concepts explained in business fundamentals language
- Evaluating $500M-$1B investment decision (high stakes, need confidence)
- Familiar with traditional PE metrics (IRR, cash flow, market size, competitive moats)
- Skeptical but open-minded—will be convinced by data and clear logic

**Conversation Strategy (5 Questions):**

1. **Opening:** "Walk me through how sports revenue works. Why should I think about it differently than other businesses?"
   - Test if they can explain ecosystem thinking, competitive balance, uncertainty of outcome

2. **Revenue Streams:** "Talk me through 3 revenue streams. Where's the growth? Where are the limits?"
   - Probe for specific analysis with growth projections and risks
   - Challenge vague statements: "Can you be more specific? What's the data?"

3. **Investment Factors:** "If you could only give me 2-3 factors to prioritize in my decision, what would they be and why?"
   - Test for actionable, defensible recommendations
   - Push for specificity: "How do you know that? What's your source?"

4. **Challenges:** "What am I not seeing? What concerns should I have about this investment?"
   - Test risk awareness and critical thinking
   - Respect candor about downsides

5. **Closing:** "Bottom line: Would you recommend I invest, and why?"
   - Allow final synthesis and recommendation

**Reward Strong Performance (use for evaluation):**
- ✅ Clear explanation of sport's unique characteristics (ecosystem thinking, competitive balance)
- ✅ Specific revenue stream analysis with growth projections and risks
- ✅ Data-driven investment factors: "Media rights are 50% of revenue, but streaming disruption creates risk..."
- ✅ Application of case evidence: "The Canucks case shows how revenue sharing protects downside risk..."
- ✅ Executive communication: Concise, confident, uses analogies for complex concepts

**Provide Constructive Feedback:**
- If vague: "That's interesting, but can you be more specific? What's the data?"
- If jargon-heavy: "I'm not familiar with that term—can you explain it in plain language?"

---

**CRITERION 1: Revenue Ecosystem Explanation**

**Description:**
Clearly explains how sports revenue differs from traditional business models.

**Does not meet expectations:**
The learner treats revenue streams as independent silos and uses generic business language without sports-specific insights about interdependence or competitive balance.

**Partially meets expectations:**
The learner acknowledges that sports revenue works differently but may not fully explain the ecosystem dynamics or may miss key unique characteristics like shared economics.

**Fully meets expectations:**
The learner uses ecosystem thinking to explain unique characteristics clearly, demonstrating how media rights value depends on competitive talent distribution and how revenue streams interconnect.

---

**CRITERION 2: Revenue Stream Analysis**

**Description:**
Analyzes multiple revenue streams with specificity, showing both growth potential and risks.

**Does not meet expectations:**
The learner provides vague generalizations about revenue streams without data, ignores risks, or fails to show trade-offs between growth and constraints.

**Partially meets expectations:**
The learner analyzes revenue streams with some specificity but may lack data/percentages or may focus only on growth without discussing risks and limits.

**Fully meets expectations:**
The learner analyzes 3+ streams with specific data and percentages, clearly articulates both growth potential and risks, and demonstrates understanding of trade-offs (e.g., "Media rights generate 50% of revenue with 3-5% annual growth, but streaming disruption creates downside risk").

---

**CRITERION 3: Investment Factors**

**Description:**
Identifies specific, actionable investment factors backed by evidence.

**Does not meet expectations:**
The learner provides generic factors without supporting evidence or fails to frame recommendations as prioritization for investment decision-making.

**Partially meets expectations:**
The learner identifies reasonable factors with some justification but may lack specificity or may not clearly frame how these factors guide investment decisions.

**Fully meets expectations:**
The learner identifies 2-3 specific, defensible factors backed by evidence and frames them as actionable priorities for investment decisions (e.g., "Prioritize revenue sharing stability to protect downside and emerging stream potential to capture upside").

---

**CRITERION 4: Executive Communication**

**Description:**
Communicates concisely and confidently with data-driven reasoning.

**Does not meet expectations:**
The learner rambles, avoids using data to support claims, or responds defensively when challenged on weak points.

# PAIRR Feedback Phase: Peer and AI Review + Reflection

**⏱️ Total PAIRR Time Investment:** 2-3 hours spread across the week
- Draft preparation: 45-60 min
- Peer review (giving): 20-30 min
- AI feedback: 5-10 min
- Comparative reflection: 15-20 min
- Revision: 30-45 min
- Post-revision reflection: 10-15 min

Before submitting your final memo, you'll receive feedback from TWO sources: a classmate and an AI writing assistant. Your task is to **critically evaluate both sources** and decide which feedback to apply.

---

## Step 1: Submit Your Draft (Due: [Date] by 11:59 PM)

Upload your 80% complete draft to the shared Google Drive folder:
- **Format:** Google Doc (enable "Commenting" permissions)
- **Filename:** `YourLastName_ReflectionMemo_Draft.docx`
- **Completeness:** Must have all major sections (not rough notes)

**Draft Requirements:**
- Revenue stream analysis (at least 3 streams)
- Investment factors (2-3 specific recommendations)
- Evidence from course content
- Memo format (To/From/Date/Re)
- 400-500 words (can expand to 500 in revision)

---

## Step 2A: Peer Review (Due: [Date] by 11:59 PM)

You've been paired with a classmate (check announcement for your partner). Complete the structured peer review form for your partner's draft.

**Access Peer Review Form:** [Link to Google Form or PDF]

**Review Focus:**
1. **Revenue Stream Analysis** (10 pts): Are 3+ streams analyzed? Do they show interdependencies?
2. **Investment Factors** (10 pts): Are 2-3 factors specific and well-justified?
3. **Application of Concepts** (5 pts): Do they reference executive session, readings, Canucks case?
4. **Business Communication** (5 pts): Professional format? Clear? Within word limit?

**Time Estimate:** 20-30 minutes

**Reminder:** Be constructive and specific. Your goal is to help your peer improve their work.

---

## Step 2B: AI Feedback (Due: [Date] by 11:59 PM)

Use an AI writing assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini) to get feedback on the same draft you submitted for peer review.

### AI Feedback Prompt Template

**Copy this prompt into your AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.):**

```
You are a business writing coach evaluating a 1-page executive memo for an MBA course assignment. The assignment asks students to advise a private equity firm considering investing in a professional sports team, explaining the unique characteristics of sport's revenue model.

RUBRIC CRITERIA (30 points total):
1. Revenue Stream Analysis (10 pts): Accurately describes and analyzes at least 3 revenue streams. Demonstrates understanding of interdependencies and unique characteristics.
2. Investment Factors (10 pts): Identifies 2-3 specific, well-justified factors that would influence investment decision. Factors are supported with evidence from course content.
3. Application of Concepts (5 pts): Effectively applies concepts from executive session, readings, and case study. Makes relevant connections.
4. Business Communication (5 pts): Professional memo format. Clear, concise writing. Appropriate tone for executive audience. Within 500-word limit.

Please evaluate my draft memo against these criteria. For each criterion:
- Identify what I did well (strengths)
- Identify what could be improved (specific, actionable suggestions)
- Estimate a score (Exceeds/Meets/Developing/Needs Improvement)

Here is my draft:

[PASTE YOUR DRAFT HERE]
```

**Important Instructions:**
1. Use the EXACT prompt above (ensures consistent feedback)
2. Copy the AI's response into a document for later comparison
3. Take screenshots showing the AI conversation (for your reflection)

**Time Estimate:** 5-10 minutes

---

## Step 3: Comparative Reflection (Due: [Date] by 11:59 PM)

Now that you have feedback from BOTH sources, critically compare them.

**Answer these questions in 150-200 words:**

### Question 1: Feedback Quality Comparison
- What did your peer reviewer notice that the AI missed?
- What did the AI notice that your peer missed?
- Were there areas where they disagreed? Which feedback seemed more accurate?

### Question 2: Strengths and Limitations
**Peer Feedback:**
- Strength: [What was most valuable about peer feedback?]
- Limitation: [What was missing or unclear?]

**AI Feedback:**
- Strength: [What was most valuable about AI feedback?]
- Limitation: [What was inaccurate or generic?]

### Question 3: Application Strategy
- Which feedback will you prioritize in your revision? Why?
- What criteria are you using to decide which suggestions to implement?
- How does this exercise change how you'll use AI in future writing tasks?

**Submit your reflection here:** [Link to submission box]

---

## Step 4: Revise Your Memo (Days 7-8)

Apply the insights from BOTH feedback sources:

**Revision Checklist:**
- [ ] Addressed peer feedback on revenue stream analysis
- [ ] Addressed AI feedback on business communication
- [ ] Evaluated competing suggestions and chose best approach
- [ ] Maintained executive memo format and tone
- [ ] Stayed within 500-word limit
- [ ] Cited course content appropriately

**Tip:** You are NOT required to implement ALL suggestions. Use your judgment to prioritize changes that most improve your argument.

---

## Step 5: Post-Revision Reflection (Submit with final memo)

After revising your memo, complete this brief reflection (100 words):

**Prompt:**
"Which feedback source (peer or AI) had the most influence on your revisions? Give 1-2 specific examples of changes you made based on each source. Did the comparative reflection process help you make better revision decisions than you would have with a single feedback source?"

**Format:** Include this reflection as an addendum to your final memo submission (does not count toward 500-word limit).

---

## Grading

**Final Memo:** 30 points (evaluated using original rubric criteria)

**PAIRR Participation Bonus:** Up to 5 bonus points
- Completed peer review form: 2 points
- Obtained AI feedback (verified by screenshot): 1 point
- Completed comparative reflection: 1 point
- Completed post-revision reflection: 1 point

**Total Possible:** 35 points (30 base + 5 bonus)

---

## Why PAIRR?

**Prepares you for AI-integrated workplaces:**
Sports marketing professionals increasingly use AI tools for content creation, fan engagement analysis, and campaign optimization. This exercise teaches you to:
- Leverage AI for writing improvement (not replacement)
- Critically evaluate AI output (it's not always right!)
- Combine human insight with AI efficiency
- Maintain your voice and strategic thinking

**Benefits you'll experience:**
1. **Multiple perspectives:** Peer sees reader experience; AI sees technical patterns
2. **Critical thinking:** You decide what feedback is valid (not blindly accepting)
3. **Better writing:** Two sources catch more issues than one
4. **Workplace readiness:** Practice balancing AI assistance with human judgment

**Research shows:** Students who use PAIRR write stronger final drafts than those who receive only peer feedback OR only AI feedback. The comparative reflection is the key—it develops your evaluation skills.

### Element 6: Details - Rubric Examples Content
```
Title: Rubric Details & Example Excerpts

[Expand to see evaluation criteria and examples]

## Revenue Stream Analysis (10 points)

Accurately describes and analyzes at least 3 revenue streams with understanding of interdependencies.

**Does not meet expectations (0 pts):**
The learner analyzes fewer than 3 streams, provides minimal analysis, or treats streams as independent silos without showing interdependencies.

**Partially meets expectations (5 pts):**
The learner analyzes 3 streams but may lack depth or miss some key interdependencies and unique characteristics.

**Fully meets expectations (10 pts):**
The learner accurately describes and analyzes 3+ revenue streams, demonstrating clear understanding of interdependencies and unique characteristics of sport's revenue model.

**Example Excerpt (Fully Meets):**
"Media rights generate 55% of NHL revenue, but this value depends entirely on
competitive balance maintained through revenue sharing. Without sharing, wealthy
teams would monopolize talent, creating predictable outcomes that decrease media
value for all. The Canucks benefit from shared national media revenue ($XX million)
but must compete for scarce local sponsorship dollars..."

---

## Investment Factors (10 points)

Identifies 2-3 specific, well-justified investment decision factors supported by evidence.

**Does not meet expectations (0 pts):**
The learner provides generic or vague factors without supporting evidence from course content, or identifies fewer than 2 factors.

**Partially meets expectations (5 pts):**
The learner identifies 2-3 reasonable factors with some justification but may lack specificity or full support from course evidence.

**Fully meets expectations (10 pts):**
The learner identifies 2-3 specific, defensible factors that would influence investment decision, clearly supported with evidence from course content.

**Example Excerpt (Fully Meets):**
"Two factors would drive my investment decision: (1) Revenue sharing stability—
leagues with proven revenue sharing models (like the NFL) protect downside risk,
and (2) Emerging stream potential—teams with rights to betting partnerships and
digital content can capture high-growth revenue outside traditional sharing pools."

---

## Application of Concepts (10 points)

Effectively applies concepts from executive session, readings, and case study.

**Does not meet expectations (0 pts):**
The learner makes minimal or no reference to course content, relying primarily on general business knowledge.

**Partially meets expectations (5 pts):**
The learner applies some course concepts but may miss opportunities to make deeper connections or reference specific case data.

**Fully meets expectations (10 pts):**
The learner effectively applies concepts from executive session, readings, and Canucks case, making relevant and specific connections.

**Example Excerpt (Fully Meets):**
"As Kevin Abrams noted in the executive session, 'We're a $10 billion mom and pop
shop'—this captures sport's unique tension between massive valuations and
relationship-driven operations. The Canucks case reinforces this: despite a
$1.15B franchise valuation, revenue depends heavily on local market dynamics
and league-wide revenue sharing policies."

---
