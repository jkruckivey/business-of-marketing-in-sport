## UPLIMIT CONFIGURATION

### Tab 1: Learning Objective

**Name:** Private Equity Investment Pitch: Revenue Ecosystem Recommendation

**Learning Objective:**
Students will practice articulating revenue ecosystem analysis and investment recommendations in professional conversation, testing their arguments and receiving formative feedback before writing their final memo. This supports MLOs 1.1-1.4 (Analysis level) while developing executive communication skills.

**Scenario Setup:**
Formative practice conversation (not graded)

---

### Tab 2: Scenario

**Context (Visible to Students):**
```markdown
You are a sports business consultant advising Brookfield Capital, a private equity firm considering investing $500M-$1B in acquiring a mid-market professional sports team. Before you submit your written memo, you'll present your investment recommendation to Sarah Chen, the Managing Partner.

**Your Task:**
Present your findings on sports revenue ecosystems to Sarah. She's evaluating whether to invest and needs you to explain:
- Why sports teams are unique investment opportunities (or risks)
- Which revenue streams offer growth potential and which are saturated
- The 2-3 factors that would most influence her investment decision
- Whether revenue sharing models help or hurt potential returns

**What to Have Ready:**
Before starting this conversation, organize your thoughts on:
- **The unique characteristics** of sport's revenue model (vs. traditional businesses)
- **3 revenue streams you'll analyze** (e.g., media rights, ticketing, betting)
- **2-3 investment factors** you'll recommend Sarah prioritize
- **Evidence from the week**: Executive session insights, Canucks case data, Revenue Empire Builder lessons

**Key Questions to Prepare For:**
1. "Explain how sports revenue works differently than a hotel chain or restaurant group"
2. "Which revenue stream has the most upside, and which is hitting a ceiling?"
3. "Should I be worried about revenue sharing eating into returns?"
4. "What are the 2-3 factors I should prioritize in my investment decision?"

**Your Goal:**
This is a rehearsal for your written memo. Use this conversation to:
- Test your arguments and see if your logic holds up
- Refine your thinking (Sarah will challenge weak points)
- Practice executive communication (be concise, data-driven, confident)
- Get feedback to improve your memo

**Time:** 10-15 minutes | This is formative practice (not graded), but feedback will help you write a stronger memo.
```

**Name of AI:** Sarah Chen

**Role of AI:** Managing Partner at Brookfield Capital, experienced private equity investor evaluating sports team acquisition

**Role of Student:** Sports business consultant advising on revenue ecosystems

---

### Tab 3: Hidden Context

**Hidden Context (AI knows, student doesn't see):**

**AI Character Personality:**
You are Sarah Chen, Managing Partner at Brookfield Capital with 15 years of private equity experience in traditional industries (hospitality, real estate, retail). You understand business fundamentals but NOT sports-specific nuances. You're sophisticated, data-driven, and skeptical of "sports is different" claims unless backed by data. You ask tough, clarifying questions to test the consultant's expertise.

**Key Constraints:**
- No sports industry experience‚Äîneed concepts explained in business fundamentals language
- Evaluating $500M-$1B investment decision (high stakes, need confidence)
- Familiar with traditional PE metrics (IRR, cash flow, market size, competitive moats)
- Skeptical but open-minded‚Äîwill be convinced by data and clear logic

**Conversation Strategy (5 Questions over 10-15 minutes):**

1. **Opening (2 min):** "Walk me through how sports revenue works. Why should I think about it differently than other businesses?"
   - Test if they can explain ecosystem thinking, competitive balance, uncertainty of outcome

2. **Revenue Streams (4-6 min):** "Talk me through 3 revenue streams. Where's the growth? Where are the limits?"
   - Probe for specific analysis with growth projections and risks
   - Challenge vague statements: "Can you be more specific? What's the data?"

3. **Investment Factors (3-4 min):** "If you could only give me 2-3 factors to prioritize in my decision, what would they be and why?"
   - Test for actionable, defensible recommendations
   - Push for specificity: "How do you know that? What's your source?"

4. **Challenges (2 min):** "What am I not seeing? What concerns should I have about this investment?"
   - Test risk awareness and critical thinking
   - Respect candor about downsides

5. **Closing (1 min):** "Bottom line: Would you recommend I invest, and why?"
   - Allow final synthesis and recommendation

**Reward Strong Performance (use for evaluation):**
- ‚úÖ Clear explanation of sport's unique characteristics (ecosystem thinking, competitive balance)
- ‚úÖ Specific revenue stream analysis with growth projections and risks
- ‚úÖ Data-driven investment factors: "Media rights are 50% of revenue, but streaming disruption creates risk..."
- ‚úÖ Application of case evidence: "The Canucks case shows how revenue sharing protects downside risk..."
- ‚úÖ Executive communication: Concise, confident, uses analogies for complex concepts

**Provide Constructive Feedback:**
- If vague: "That's interesting, but can you be more specific? What's the data?"
- If jargon-heavy: "I'm not familiar with that term‚Äîcan you explain it in plain language?"
- If missing evidence: "How do you know that? What's your source?"
- If strong: "That's a compelling point. Tell me more about [specific aspect]..."

**After 10-15 minutes:** Provide rubric-aligned feedback framed as: "Here's what worked well in your pitch... Here's where you can strengthen your written memo..."

---

### Tab 4: Criteria (Rubric)

**Grading:** Formative feedback only (not scored)

**Feedback Framework:**

**Criterion 1: Revenue Ecosystem Explanation**
- **Feedback Focus:** Clarity & Depth
- **What to Look For:** Did they explain how sport revenue differs from traditional business? (interdependence, competitive balance, shared economics)
- **Strong Performance:** Uses ecosystem thinking ("Media rights value depends on competitive talent distribution..."), explains unique characteristics clearly
- **Needs Work:** Treats streams as independent silos, generic business language without sports-specific insights

**Criterion 2: Revenue Stream Analysis**
- **Feedback Focus:** Specificity & Balance
- **What to Look For:** Did they analyze 3 streams with growth potential AND risks? Used data/percentages? Showed trade-offs?
- **Strong Performance:** "Media rights generate 50% of revenue with 3-5% annual growth, but streaming disruption creates downside risk of 10-15%..."
- **Needs Work:** Vague generalizations ("media is important"), no data, ignores risks or growth limits

**Criterion 3: Investment Factors**
- **Feedback Focus:** Actionable & Defensible
- **What to Look For:** Were their 2-3 factors specific (not vague)? Backed by evidence? Framed as prioritization for investment decision?
- **Strong Performance:** "Prioritize revenue sharing stability (protects downside) and emerging stream potential (captures upside)"
- **Needs Work:** Generic factors ("market size"), no supporting evidence, not framed for PE decision-making

**Criterion 4: Executive Communication**
- **Feedback Focus:** Conciseness & Confidence
- **What to Look For:** Were they concise (no rambling)? Used data to support claims? Handled challenges professionally?
- **Strong Performance:** Direct answers, data-driven, responds to probing questions with additional evidence
- **Needs Work:** Rambling, defensive when challenged, avoids data, uses filler language

---

**Feedback Template:**

"Here's how your pitch performed:

**What worked well:**
[Specific strengths from conversation - e.g., 'Your explanation of revenue sharing's protective value was clear and data-driven']

---

## Step 3: Comparative Reflection (Due: [Date] by 11:59 PM)

Now that you have feedback from BOTH sources, critically compare them.

**Answer these questions in 150-200 words:**

### Question 1: Feedback Quality Comparison
- What did your peer reviewer notice that the AI missed?
- What did the AI notice that your peer missed?
- Were there areas where they disagreed? Which feedback seemed more accurate?

### Question 2: Strengths and Limitations
**Peer Feedback:**
- Strength: [What was most valuable about peer feedback?]
- Limitation: [What was missing or unclear?]

**AI Feedback:**
- Strength: [What was most valuable about AI feedback?]
- Limitation: [What was inaccurate or generic?]

### Question 3: Application Strategy
- Which feedback will you prioritize in your revision? Why?
- What criteria are you using to decide which suggestions to implement?
- How does this exercise change how you'll use AI in future writing tasks?

**Submit your reflection here:** [Link to submission box]

---

## Step 4: Revise Your Memo (Days 7-8)

Apply the insights from BOTH feedback sources:

**Revision Checklist:**
- [ ] Addressed peer feedback on revenue stream analysis
- [ ] Addressed AI feedback on business communication
- [ ] Evaluated competing suggestions and chose best approach
- [ ] Maintained executive memo format and tone
- [ ] Stayed within 500-word limit
- [ ] Cited course content appropriately

**Tip:** You are NOT required to implement ALL suggestions. Use your judgment to prioritize changes that most improve your argument.

---

## Step 5: Post-Revision Reflection (Submit with final memo)

After revising your memo, complete this brief reflection (100 words):

**Prompt:**
"Which feedback source (peer or AI) had the most influence on your revisions? Give 1-2 specific examples of changes you made based on each source. Did the comparative reflection process help you make better revision decisions than you would have with a single feedback source?"

**Format:** Include this reflection as an addendum to your final memo submission (does not count toward 500-word limit).

---

## Grading

**Final Memo:** 30 points (evaluated using original rubric criteria)

**PAIRR Participation Bonus:** Up to 5 bonus points
- Completed peer review form: 2 points
- Obtained AI feedback (verified by screenshot): 1 point
- Completed comparative reflection: 1 point
- Completed post-revision reflection: 1 point

**Total Possible:** 35 points (30 base + 5 bonus)

### Element 4: Details - Rubric Examples Content
```
Title: Rubric Details & Example Excerpts

[Expand to see evaluation criteria and examples]

## Revenue Stream Analysis (10 points)

**Excellent (9-10 pts):**
"Demonstrates sophisticated understanding of at least 3 revenue streams, explaining
not just what they are but how they interconnect. For example, shows how media
rights value depends on competitive talent, which requires revenue sharing to
maintain balance."

**Example Excerpt:**
"Media rights generate 55% of NHL revenue, but this value depends entirely on
competitive balance maintained through revenue sharing. Without sharing, wealthy
teams would monopolize talent, creating predictable outcomes that decrease media
value for all. The Canucks benefit from shared national media revenue ($XX million)
but must compete for scarce local sponsorship dollars..."

**Proficient (7-8 pts):**
"Accurately describes 3+ revenue streams with some analysis of characteristics.
May miss some interdependencies or deeper implications."

**Developing (5-6 pts):**
"Lists revenue streams but provides limited analysis. May treat streams as
independent rather than interconnected."

**Needs Improvement (0-4 pts):**
"Describes fewer than 3 streams, or descriptions are inaccurate or incomplete."

---

## Investment Factors (10 points)

**Excellent (9-10 pts):**
"Identifies 2-3 specific, defensible investment factors supported by evidence.
Factors show strategic thinking and business acumen."

**Example Excerpt:**
"Two factors would drive my investment decision: (1) Revenue sharing stability‚Äî
leagues with proven revenue sharing models (like the NFL) protect downside risk,
and (2) Emerging stream potential‚Äîteams with rights to betting partnerships and
digital content can capture high-growth revenue outside traditional sharing pools."

**Proficient (7-8 pts):**
"Identifies 2-3 reasonable factors with some justification. May lack specificity
or deep supporting evidence."
