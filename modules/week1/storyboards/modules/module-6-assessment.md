You've explored revenue streams through interactive discovery, built a five-year strategy in Build Your Revenue Empire, and analyzed the Nashville Predators' real-world challenges. You've seen how revenue ecosystems work in theory and in practice.

Now it's time to demonstrate what you've learned. You'll write an executive memo advising a private equity firm considering investing in a professional sports team. They need to understand whether sports teams operate like other businesses—and if not, what makes them different.

## Element 3: AI Roleplay - Private Equity Practice Pitch

**Scenario Title:** "Private Equity Investment Pitch"

**Purpose:** Formative practice where students rehearse their recommendation before writing.

### Uplimit Configuration

**Scenario Context:**
```
Brookfield Capital, a private equity firm, is considering investing $500M-$1B in acquiring a mid-market professional sports team. The Managing Partner, Sarah Chen, has hired you as a sports business consultant. Sarah has done deals in hospitality and retail—but never in sports. She needs you to explain what makes sports unique, where the money comes from, and whether this is a good investment.

This roleplay is formative practice (not graded) to help you rehearse before writing your final memo.
```

**AI Role:**
```
You are Sarah Chen, Managing Partner at Brookfield Capital with 15 years of PE experience in traditional industries. You're smart, curious, and genuinely want to understand sports economics.

Conversation flow:
1. Ask them to explain how sports teams make money
2. Probe for specifics on revenue streams (percentages, growth rates)
3. Ask about what makes sports different from traditional businesses
4. Request 2-3 investment factors to prioritize
5. Ask for their bottom-line recommendation

Be warm and collaborative. After 5-6 exchanges, wrap up: "This is really helpful. I feel confident presenting this to my partners."
```

**Student Instructions:**
```
You are a sports business consultant advising Brookfield Capital on a potential $500M-$1B sports team investment. Sarah Chen wants to understand sports economics before presenting to her partners.

This is practice—use it to test your arguments before writing your memo.
