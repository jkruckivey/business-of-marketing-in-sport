Title: ◉ Week 1 Key Takeaways

You've completed your introduction to sport revenue ecosystems! The five critical insights: (1) revenue streams are interdependent (not isolated), (2) sport operates uniquely with on-field competition alongside economic collaboration, (3) revenue sharing balances competitive equality against entrepreneurial constraints, (4) centralized merchandising (like NFL Properties) creates league-wide value that individual teams couldn't achieve alone, and (5) frontier opportunities exist in betting and streaming. This foundation prepares you for Week 2's deep dive into media rights and fan engagement monetization—two of the highest-value and fastest-changing revenue streams. Well done!

## Connecting to Your Group Marketing Project

As you begin thinking about your Group Marketing Project (60% of final grade),
consider how this week's content applies:

Your task will be to develop a comprehensive marketing plan for a sport organization.
Revenue strategy is the foundation of any marketing plan—you can't make strategic
marketing decisions without understanding revenue generation and constraints.

Questions to consider as you form your project team and select your organization:
• Which revenue streams offer the most growth potential for your chosen organization?
• How does revenue sharing (if applicable) constrain or enable marketing strategy?
• What emerging revenue streams (betting, NFTs, metaverse) could your organization leverage?
• How can marketing investments increase multiple revenue streams simultaneously?

We'll explore these questions throughout the course. By Week 5, you'll integrate
everything into a cohesive marketing strategy.

Start thinking about project teams and organization selection. More details in
the Project Guide (available on course homepage).

## 🎯 FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION

**How Week 1 Supports Your Final Strategic Vision:**

Week 1 provided the foundational framework for analyzing ANY sports property. This is the analytical bedrock for your Week 5 capstone.

**What You Mastered:**
- The 5-stream revenue model (media, ticketing, sponsorship, merchandising, betting) and how to map any property's revenue mix
- Ecosystem thinking (investments in one stream cascade through all others)
- Revenue sharing models and their strategic constraints (NFL 60%, NHL 50%, EPL tiered)
- Strategic communication (defending recommendations with data)

**How to Apply This to Your Final Project:**

Your Week 5 strategic vision MUST begin with Week 1's frameworks. Every subsequent week (media rights, sponsorship/betting, athlete brands, heritage/innovation) builds on this foundation:

- **Revenue Analysis Section:** Structure your analysis using the 5-stream model. Show current state, then project 5-year growth by stream. Explain interdependencies (e.g., "Signing star player increases merchandise 30%, ticketing 15%, and media value 10%").
- **Constraint Mapping:** Identify structural constraints (revenue sharing, league rules, market size) that limit your strategic options. Week 1 taught you that great strategy works within reality—acknowledge constraints upfront.
- **Ecosystem Effects:** When you propose any major investment (new stadium, signing athlete, launching streaming service), quantify the cascade effects across all revenue streams. This is Week 1's core insight.

**Integration Across All Weeks:**
- Week 1 = Foundation (revenue ecosystem framework)
- Week 2 = Media rights specialization (how to evaluate and negotiate)
- Week 3 = Sponsorship/betting specialization (how to calculate and activate)
- Week 4 = Athlete brand specialization (how to build equity assets)
- Week 5 = Integration (synthesizing all frameworks into coherent 5-year vision)

**Real-World Application:** Every sports executive starts with the same question: "How do we make money?" Week 1 gave you the universal answer framework. Weeks 2-5 add depth and sophistication. Your capstone synthesizes everything.
