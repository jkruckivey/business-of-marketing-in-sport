## Element 1: Infobox Content

Title: ◉ Week 1 Key Takeaways

You've completed your introduction to sport revenue ecosystems! The five critical insights: (1) revenue streams are interdependent (not isolated), (2) sport operates uniquely with on-field competition alongside economic collaboration, (3) revenue sharing balances competitive equality against entrepreneurial constraints, (4) centralized merchandising (like NFL Properties) creates league-wide value that individual teams couldn't achieve alone, and (5) frontier opportunities exist in betting and streaming. This foundation prepares you for Week 2's deep dive into media rights and fan engagement monetization—two of the highest-value and fastest-changing revenue streams. Well done!

**Up Next:** CFL Expansion Milestone 1, then Week 2 preview.

## CFL Expansion Project: Milestone 1 - Market Selection & Revenue Projections

Welcome to your first Anchor Project milestone! Throughout this course, you'll develop a comprehensive expansion proposal for a new CFL franchise. Each week builds on the previous, culminating in a complete business plan.

**Your Challenge:** Select a Canadian city for CFL expansion and project its 5-year revenue potential using the frameworks you learned this week.

**Why This Matters:** Before any professional sports league expands, they conduct rigorous market analysis. You're doing the same work that real league executives do when evaluating expansion opportunities.

**Apply Week 1 Frameworks:**
- Use the 5-stream revenue model to project comprehensive revenue
- Consider how revenue sharing affects your franchise's economics
- Think about ecosystem effects—how do investments in one stream cascade to others?

**Suggested Cities:** Halifax, Quebec City, Saskatoon, London ON, Moncton—or propose your own with justification!
