Title: ✦ Week 1 Key Takeaways

You've completed your introduction to sport revenue ecosystems! Here's what you
should take away:

- Revenue streams are interdependent, not independent
- Sport's business model is unique—competition on field, collaboration on economics
- Revenue sharing creates competitive balance but constrains entrepreneurial upside
- Growth opportunities exist at the frontier (betting, streaming, international)

This foundation prepares you for Week 2, where we'll dive deep into media rights
and fan engagement monetization—two of the highest-value and fastest-changing
revenue streams.

Well done!

### Element 2: Text Content - Group Marketing Project Connection

## Connecting to Your Group Marketing Project

As you begin thinking about your Group Marketing Project (60% of final grade),
consider how this week's content applies:

Your task will be to develop a comprehensive marketing plan for a sport organization.
Revenue strategy is the foundation of any marketing plan—you can't make strategic
marketing decisions without understanding revenue generation and constraints.

Questions to consider as you form your project team and select your organization:
• Which revenue streams offer the most growth potential for your chosen organization?
• How does revenue sharing (if applicable) constrain or enable marketing strategy?
• What emerging revenue streams (betting, NFTs, metaverse) could your organization leverage?
• How can marketing investments increase multiple revenue streams simultaneously?

We'll explore these questions throughout the course. By Week 5, you'll integrate
everything into a cohesive marketing strategy.

Start thinking about project teams and organization selection. More details in
the Project Guide (available on course homepage).

## Looking Ahead: Week 2 - Media, Content & Fan Engagement

Next week, we go deep on the largest and most dynamic revenue stream: media rights.

You'll explore:
• How media rights are valued and negotiated
• The shift from traditional broadcasting to streaming
• Fan engagement strategies and monetization
• Major deals analysis (e.g., Rogers/NHL $5.2 billion)

Executive Leader: [Name, Title]
Core Case: Rogers Communications and the NHL Rights Deal

**PLUS: Anchor Project Launch!** ◉
Week 2 marks the beginning of your course-long Anchor Project (60% of final grade).
You'll form teams of 5-6 students and select a sport property to analyze over the
remaining weeks. Start thinking about potential teammates and organizations that
interest you!

**Estimated Time Commitment:** Week 2 = 7-9 hours total (includes 2-3 hours for team
formation and property selection)

Get ready for another intensive week of learning! See you in Week 2.
