Title: ◉ Week 1 Key Takeaways

You've completed your introduction to sport revenue ecosystems! The four critical insights: revenue streams are interdependent (not isolated), sport operates uniquely with on-field competition alongside economic collaboration, revenue sharing balances competitive equality against entrepreneurial constraints, and frontier opportunities exist in betting and streaming. This foundation prepares you for Week 2's deep dive into media rights and fan engagement monetization—two of the highest-value and fastest-changing revenue streams. Well done!

## Connecting to Your Group Marketing Project

As you begin thinking about your Group Marketing Project (60% of final grade),
consider how this week's content applies:

Your task will be to develop a comprehensive marketing plan for a sport organization.
Revenue strategy is the foundation of any marketing plan—you can't make strategic
marketing decisions without understanding revenue generation and constraints.

Questions to consider as you form your project team and select your organization:
• Which revenue streams offer the most growth potential for your chosen organization?
• How does revenue sharing (if applicable) constrain or enable marketing strategy?
• What emerging revenue streams (betting, NFTs, metaverse) could your organization leverage?
• How can marketing investments increase multiple revenue streams simultaneously?

We'll explore these questions throughout the course. By Week 5, you'll integrate
everything into a cohesive marketing strategy.

Start thinking about project teams and organization selection. More details in
the Project Guide (available on course homepage).
