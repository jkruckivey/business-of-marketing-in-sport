### Element 4: Anchor Project Connection Infobox
**Type:** Infobox (Callout) - Yellow variant

```
Title: ⭐ Anchor Project Connection: Your Success Criteria

Stewart Johnston just told you exactly what he's looking for in a CFL expansion market. This is your success criteria.

**The Three Priorities Your Proposal Must Address:**

**Priority 1: Entertainment**
How does your market enhance the CFL's entertainment value? Consider venue experience, media market reach, entertainment partnerships.

**Priority 2: Youth Engagement**
How does your expansion grow youth participation? Consider football programs, school partnerships, community engagement potential.

**Priority 3: Profitability**
Can your 10th team be profitable? Consider market size, corporate sponsor base, stadium economics, operating costs.

**Critical Insight:**
Stewart said expansion is NOT in his top 3 priorities. This means your business case must show how a 10th team **strengthens** entertainment, youth engagement, and profitability—not distracts from them.

**The Question Your Proposal Answers:**
"How does adding this franchise help the CFL achieve its three strategic priorities faster than it could with nine teams?"

- A: Merchandise sales and ticket revenue
- B: Media rights and commercial sponsorships ✅

Knowing what drives league revenue helps you understand why media market size and sponsor appeal matter for expansion decisions.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Correct! Stewart states: "The two biggest drivers of revenue at the league office are within the media rights and commercial partnerships with sponsors." Gate revenue goes to individual teams, not the league.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Review Stewart's discussion of league-level revenue. He emphasizes that media rights and commercial partnerships (sponsorships) are his primary focus as commissioner. Ticket revenue goes to teams, not the league.
```

**Points:** 1 | **Shuffle options:** Yes

---

**Question 3: Strategic Priorities**

**Question:**
```
Stewart identifies three strategic priorities for the CFL. Which is NOT one of his top three priorities?
```

**Options:**
- A: Relentless focus on entertainment
- B: Getting footballs into kids' hands (youth engagement)
- C: Creating nine profitable teams
- D: Expanding to a 10th team ✅

**After Submission:**
```
This is the most important insight for your Anchor Project. Expansion must support these three priorities—not compete with them.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Correct! Stewart explicitly states that expansion is NOT in his top 3 priorities, even though he expects a 10th team within 10 years. His priorities are: (1) entertainment, (2) youth engagement, and (3) nine profitable teams.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Stewart clearly says expansion is not in his top three priorities. His three priorities are entertainment, youth engagement, and making all nine current teams profitable. Your proposal must show how expansion advances these priorities.
```

**Points:** 1 | **Shuffle options:** Yes

---

**Question 4: Fan Base Challenge**

**Question:**
```
Stewart describes the CFL's core fans as having what characteristic that creates a strategic challenge?
```

**Options:**
- A: They're primarily young, tech-savvy viewers who demand streaming

- C: They're casual viewers who only watch playoffs

**After Submission:**
```
Understanding the existing fan base helps you think about how expansion markets can grow new audiences without alienating loyal fans.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Correct! Stewart describes the challenge of serving loyal 30-40 year season ticket holders who are "absolutely passionate" while also growing new audiences. This creates a tradition vs. innovation tension that any expansion must navigate.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Stewart specifically mentions that the CFL's core fans are long-term (30-40 year) season ticket holders. This creates a strategic challenge: how to grow new audiences without alienating passionate traditionalists.
```

**Points:** 1 | **Shuffle options:** Yes

---

**Question 5: Expansion Timeline**

**Question:**
```
What is Stewart's stated expectation for CFL expansion?
```

Stewart's timeline tells you this is a realistic goal—but not an urgent one. Your proposal should be compelling enough to accelerate the timeline.
```

**Feedback for correct answers:**
```
Correct! Stewart expects a 10th team within 10 years: "If we haven't got a 10th team... I'll be disappointed." He notes there are "great markets across this country that could support a team"—but expansion is not in his top 3 priorities.
```

**Feedback for incorrect answers:**
```
Stewart discusses a realistic timeline for expansion. He's not rushing it (not top 3 priority), but he expects the league to have a 10th team within the next decade. He'd be "disappointed" if it doesn't happen.
```

**Points:** 1 | **Shuffle options:** Yes

---
