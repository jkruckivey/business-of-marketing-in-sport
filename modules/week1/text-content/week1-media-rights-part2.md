# Media Rights Part 2: The Streaming Wars

The rise of streaming has fundamentally disrupted sports media economics. Companies like Amazon, Apple, and DAZN have entered bidding wars, driving rights values higher while introducing new business models.

## Major Streaming Entries

**Tech Company Investments:**
- **Amazon:** NFL Thursday Night Football - **$1 billion/year**
- **Apple:** MLS - **$250 million/year**
- **Apple:** MLB Friday Night Baseball
- **DAZN:** Boxing, soccer, international sports

## How Streaming Differs from Traditional Broadcasting

Streaming platforms operate with fundamentally different economics:

| **Factor** | **Traditional TV** | **Streaming** |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Revenue model** | Advertising-dependent | Subscription-based |
| **Geographic reach** | Regional licensing | Global distribution |
| **Engagement data** | Aggregated ratings (Nielsen) | Detailed viewer analytics |
| **Profitability timeline** | Immediate ROI expectations | 3-5 year payback periods |

## The Hybrid Model Emerges

Leagues increasingly split rights packages to maximize total revenue:
- Sell traditional TV rights to one partner (NBC, ESPN)
- Sell streaming rights to another (Apple, Amazon)
- Create direct-to-consumer platforms (NBA League Pass, NHL.TV, NFL+)

This **"hybrid model"** hedges against uncertainty about the future of television while capturing value from both worlds.

## Strategic Value for Tech Companies

Why do tech companies pay premium prices for sports rights?

**Defensive Value (Traditional Broadcasters):**
- ESPN pays top dollar to prevent subscriber exodus
- Sports are the main reason many consumers keep cable subscriptions
- "Sports is the glue holding the bundle together"

**Offensive Value (Streaming Disruptors):**
- Amazon uses NFL to drive Prime subscriptions
- Apple uses MLS to establish credibility in sports
- Sports become the "killer app" attracting subscribers

The most sophisticated valuations consider **strategic fit**, not just immediate profitability. Sports rights help platforms achieve broader goals, justifying prices that seem economically irrational based on direct advertising or subscription revenue alone.
