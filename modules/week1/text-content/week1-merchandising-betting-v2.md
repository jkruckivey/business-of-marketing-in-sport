# Merchandising & Betting: Established and Emerging Streams

## Merchandising: Brand Extension

Merchandising and licensing revenue represents **5-10% of revenue** for most teams. Professional leagues take different approaches:

**Centralized Model (NFL, NHL, MLB):**
- League office manages all licensing
- Revenue pooled and distributed equally to all teams
- Protects small-market teams from imbalance

**Decentralized Model (European Soccer):**
- Teams control their own merchandise rights
- Popular clubs generate 10-20× more than smaller clubs
- Rewards brand-building but creates wealth disparity

**Key Revenue Drivers:**
- **Championship runs:** Sales increase **200-400%** during playoffs
- **Star acquisitions:** LeBron's Lakers trade = **$1M+ in jersey sales within hours**
- **New designs:** NBA "City Edition" jerseys generate **$100M+ annually**

Digital commerce has transformed the economics—teams can test designs instantly, collect customer data, and sell globally. The Toronto Raptors ship merchandise to **85+ countries** through their online store.
