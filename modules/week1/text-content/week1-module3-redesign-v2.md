# MODULE 3: Core Reading & Revenue Stream Framework - REDESIGN V2
**Purpose:** Provide foundational knowledge about each revenue stream with MAXIMUM VARIED delivery methods (supports MLO 1.1, 1.2, 1.3)

**Uplimit Structure:** Third module in Unit 1

## Problem with V1 Redesign

While V1 broke up the 3,500-word text block into 14 elements, user feedback identified it's **still too text-heavy**:
- 6 text blocks (200, 500, 600, 650, 600, 550 words)
- Total: ~2,600 words of continuous reading
- Text blocks appear in clusters (3-4 min reading ‚Üí another 4-5 min reading)

## V2 Solution: Add More Visual/Interactive Breaks

**Key Changes:**
1. **Break longer text blocks** (500-650 words) into smaller chunks (300-400 words max)
2. **Add second video** (2 minutes) to break up text between streams
3. **Add interactive flashcard element** for key terminology
4. **Add more images** (4 total instead of 2)
5. **Add AI Chat Widget** for student questions
6. **Ensure no more than 2 consecutive text elements**

## Design Rationale (V2 vs V1)

### V1 Problem:
- 6 text blocks, some 4-5 minutes long
- Text clusters: Read 500 words ‚Üí Read 600 words ‚Üí Read 650 words (13 minutes of continuous reading)
- Only 2 images (often skipped as "recommended")
- Single 2-minute video at start
- User feedback: "still too text heavy"

### V2 Solution:
- **9 text blocks, all 2-3 minutes max** (300-400 words)
- **No text clusters**: Visual/interactive break every 2-3 elements
- **Second video at midpoint** (element 12 of 20) = major mental break
- **4 images instead of 2**: More visual reinforcement, specific image between each major stream
- **AI Chat Widget**: Encourages active engagement, student-driven exploration

### Pedagogical Improvements:
1. **Cognitive Load Reduction**: No single reading exceeds working memory capacity (~3 min)
2. **Dual Coding Theory**: Text + visual for each major stream enhances retention
3. **Active Learning**: AI Chat invites student questions and exploration
4. **UDL Compliance**: Multiple means of representation (text, video, image, interactive)
5. **Attention Management**: Video break at midpoint re-engages attention

---

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Required Elements):
1. Break existing text files into smaller chunks (300-400 words)
2. Create **second video script** (Element 12: Sponsorship & Merchandising)
3. Add **2 new images** (media timeline, sponsorship pyramid)
4. Configure **AI Chat Widget** with proper prompt

### Medium Priority (Recommended Elements):
- Create all 4 images (2 existing + 2 new)
- Ensure consistent visual style across images

### Low Priority (Optional Elements):
- Details accordion (already created)
- AI Chat Widget (nice-to-have, not critical)

---

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Write shortened/split text files** (9 new .md files)
2. **Write Video 2 script** (2 minutes, sponsorship + merchandising)
3. **Create image specifications** for 2 new visuals
4. **Update Week 1 storyboard** to reflect 20-element structure
5. **Update CLAUDE.md** development log with V2 redesign rationale

---

**This V2 redesign maintains the same learning objectives and total time (~20 minutes) while DRAMATICALLY reducing text density through strategic visual breaks, a second video at midpoint, and more interactive elements.**
