**Content:** 500-word focused reading on media rights

### Element 6: Infobox - Appointment Viewing Insight
```
Title: Key Insight: "Appointment Viewing" in an On-Demand World 📺

Sports are the last true appointment viewing. You can't watch a game "later" without
risking spoilers from social media, friends, or news alerts. This creates:

• Predictable, simultaneous audience (rare in 2024)
• Premium advertising rates (live = engaged = valuable)
• Subscription retention power (can't cancel during season)
• Cultural currency ("Did you see that play?")

This unique characteristic explains why sports rights command prices that seem
economically irrational—until you understand their strategic defensive value for
traditional broadcasters and offensive value for streaming disruptors.
```

### Element 7: Ticketing Deep Dive Text
**File:** `week1-ticketing-deep-dive.md`

**Caption:** "Premium Seating Economics: 10-15% of Capacity Generates 40-50% of Revenue"
**Size:** Optimized for web, max 800px width

**Visual to Create:**
- Stadium cross-section with three seating tiers
- Each tier labeled with:
  - % of total capacity
  - Average price per seat/season
  - % of total ticketing revenue
- Visual emphasis on premium tier generating disproportionate revenue

---

### Element 9: Sponsorship Deep Dive Text
**File:** `week1-sponsorship-deep-dive.md`
**Content:** 650-word focused reading on sponsorship and partnerships

### Element 10: Details - Sponsorship ROI Measurement
```
Title: How Sponsors Measure Success

[Expand for deeper understanding of sponsorship evaluation]

Sophisticated sponsors don't just count logo impressions. They measure three categories:

**1. Brand Awareness Metrics**
- Aided/unaided brand recall surveys
- Social media mentions and reach
- Media value equivalency (estimated PR value)
Example: "After 6 months of arena naming rights, unaided brand awareness increased from 22% to 38% in target market"

**2. Brand Favorability Tracking**
- Pre/post sponsorship sentiment analysis
- Net Promoter Score (NPS) changes
- Brand perception studies (quality, trust, innovation scores)
Example: "NHL partnership increased 'trustworthy' ratings by 12 points among males 25-54"

**3. Customer Acquisition Attribution**
- Promo code redemption (exclusive to sponsorship)
- Survey question: "How did you hear about us?"
- Cohort analysis (customers acquired during sponsorship period)
Example: "Suite hospitality events generated 47 qualified leads, 12 converted to customers, $480K revenue"

**Good Activation Example:**
Scotiabank's "Scene+ Night" at Leafs games—integrates loyalty program with ticket offers and in-arena experiences. Tracks Scene+ sign-ups, redemptions, and spending lift.

**Poor Activation Example:**
Logo on rink board with no activation. No way to attribute business impact beyond "people saw it."

• Growing 30-40% year-over-year
• 38+ U.S. states legalized (2024), covering 70%+ of population
• Canada legalized single-game betting (August 2021)
• Global market: $200+ billion annually

Impact Beyond Direct Revenue:
Fans with bets watch 30-40% more sports content, driving higher media rights values,
sponsorship engagement, and betting integration creates valuable first-party data for
marketing partners.

Betting is transforming fan engagement from passive viewing to active participation.

## Design Rationale for Redesigned Module

**Original Problem:**
- Single 3,500-word text block
- 20+ minute continuous reading
- Monotonous delivery
- Low engagement

**Redesigned Solution:**
- **14 varied elements** (6 text, 1 video, 2 images, 2 infoboxes, 1 list, 1 table, 1 details)
- **6 short text blocks** (2-5 minutes each) instead of one long block
- **Visual breaks** every 2-4 elements
- **Strategic callouts** highlight key insights
- **Optional depth** (Details accordion) for interested students

**Student Experience:**
1. Read brief intro (2 min)
2. Watch overview video (2 min)
3. Scan visual reference (list + table)
4. Read about media rights (3-4 min) + see callout
5. Read about ticketing (4-5 min) + see visual diagram
6. Read about sponsorship (4-5 min) + optional deep dive
7. Read about merchandising/betting (4-5 min) + see stats callout
8. Read final synthesis (3-4 min) + see ecosystem diagram

**Total Time:** ~20 minutes (same as original)
**Engagement:** Much higher due to varied delivery

**UDL Principles:**
- ✅ Multiple means of representation (text, video, visual, interactive)
- ✅ Strategic use of emphasis (infoboxes, callouts)
- ✅ Optional progressive disclosure (Details accordion)
- ✅ Digestible chunks (no single element over 5 minutes)

**This redesigned module maintains the same content and learning outcomes while dramatically improving student engagement through varied delivery methods.**
