### Element 6: Infobox - Appointment Viewing Insight
```
Title: Key Insight: "Appointment Viewing" in an On-Demand World ðŸ“º

Sports are the last true appointment viewing. You can't watch a game "later" without
risking spoilers from social media, friends, or news alerts. This creates:

â€¢ Predictable, simultaneous audience (rare in 2024)
â€¢ Premium advertising rates (live = engaged = valuable)
â€¢ Subscription retention power (can't cancel during season)
â€¢ Cultural currency ("Did you see that play?")

This unique characteristic explains why sports rights command prices that seem
economically irrationalâ€”until you understand their strategic defensive value for
traditional broadcasters and offensive value for streaming disruptors.
```

### Element 7: Ticketing Deep Dive Text
**File:** `week1-ticketing-deep-dive.md`

**Caption:** "Premium Seating Economics: 10-15% of Capacity Generates 40-50% of Revenue"
**Size:** Optimized for web, max 800px width

**Visual to Create:**
- Stadium cross-section with three seating tiers
- Each tier labeled with:
  - % of total capacity
  - Average price per seat/season
  - % of total ticketing revenue
- Visual emphasis on premium tier generating disproportionate revenue

---

### Element 9: Sponsorship Deep Dive Text

### Element 10: Details - Sponsorship ROI Measurement
```
Title: How Sponsors Measure Success

[Expand for deeper understanding of sponsorship evaluation]

Sophisticated sponsors don't just count logo impressions. They measure three categories:

**1. Brand Awareness Metrics**
- Aided/unaided brand recall surveys
- Social media mentions and reach
- Media value equivalency (estimated PR value)
Example: "After 6 months of arena naming rights, unaided brand awareness increased from 22% to 38% in target market"

**2. Brand Favorability Tracking**
- Pre/post sponsorship sentiment analysis
- Net Promoter Score (NPS) changes
- Brand perception studies (quality, trust, innovation scores)
Example: "NHL partnership increased 'trustworthy' ratings by 12 points among males 25-54"

**3. Customer Acquisition Attribution**
- Promo code redemption (exclusive to sponsorship)
- Survey question: "How did you hear about us?"
- Cohort analysis (customers acquired during sponsorship period)
Example: "Suite hospitality events generated 47 qualified leads, 12 converted to customers, $480K revenue"

**Good Activation Example:**
Scotiabank's "Scene+ Night" at Leafs gamesâ€”integrates loyalty program with ticket offers and in-arena experiences. Tracks Scene+ sign-ups, redemptions, and spending lift.

**Poor Activation Example:**
Logo on rink board with no activation. No way to attribute business impact beyond "people saw it."
```

### Element 12: Infobox - Betting Growth Statistics
```
Title: Betting's Explosive Growth ðŸ“ˆ

Key Statistics:

â€¢ Currently 2-8% of league revenue
â€¢ Growing 30-40% year-over-year
â€¢ 38+ U.S. states legalized (2024), covering 70%+ of population
â€¢ Canada legalized single-game betting (August 2021)
â€¢ Global market: $200+ billion annually

Impact Beyond Direct Revenue:
Fans with bets watch 30-40% more sports content, driving higher media rights values,
sponsorship engagement, and betting integration creates valuable first-party data for
marketing partners.

Betting is transforming fan engagement from passive viewing to active participation.

## Design Rationale for Redesigned Module

**Original Problem:**
- Single 3,500-word text block
- 20+ minute continuous reading
- Monotonous delivery
- Low engagement

**Redesigned Solution:**
- **14 varied elements** (6 text, 1 video, 2 images, 2 infoboxes, 1 list, 1 table, 1 details)
- **6 short text blocks** (2-5 minutes each) instead of one long block
- **Visual breaks** every 2-4 elements
- **Strategic callouts** highlight key insights
- **Optional depth** (Details accordion) for interested students

**Student Experience:**
1. Read brief intro (2 min)
2. Watch overview video (2 min)
3. Scan visual reference (list + table)
4. Read about media rights (3-4 min) + see callout
5. Read about ticketing (4-5 min) + see visual diagram
6. Read about sponsorship (4-5 min) + optional deep dive
7. Read about merchandising/betting (4-5 min) + see stats callout
8. Read final synthesis (3-4 min) + see ecosystem diagram

**Total Time:** ~20 minutes (same as original)
**Engagement:** Much higher due to varied delivery

**UDL Principles:**
- âœ… Multiple means of representation (text, video, visual, interactive)
- âœ… Strategic use of emphasis (infoboxes, callouts)
- âœ… Optional progressive disclosure (Details accordion)
- âœ… Digestible chunks (no single element over 5 minutes)

**This redesigned module maintains the same content and learning objectives while dramatically improving student engagement through varied delivery methods.**
