# Sponsorship: Brand Alignment and Activation

Corporate sponsorship represents **15-25% of revenue** for most professional teams, with higher percentages in markets with deep-pocketed corporations. Unlike passive advertising, effective sponsorships create **brand associations through integrated experiences**.

## Naming Rights: Geographic Brand Ownership

Stadium and arena naming rights are the most visible (and valuable) sponsorship deals:

**Major Market Examples:**
- **Scotiabank Arena** (Toronto): ~$800 million over 20 years (**$40M/year**)
- **Chase Center** (Golden State Warriors): ~$300 million over 20 years (**$15M/year**)
- **Climate Pledge Arena** (Seattle Kraken): ~$200-300M over 15 years

Naming rights provide consistent brand exposure—mentioned in broadcasts, printed on tickets, embedded in digital content, and used in everyday conversation ("I'm going to Chase tonight"). It's **geographic brand ownership**, not just signage.

## Jersey and Uniform Sponsorship

The NBA pioneered jersey sponsorship in North America in 2017, allowing teams to sell a 2.5" x 2.5" patch on uniforms:

- **Golden State Warriors + Rakuten:** ~$20M/year
- **Los Angeles Lakers + Bibigo:** ~$12-14M/year
- **Boston Celtics + Vistaprint:** ~$7-10M/year

Jersey sponsorship is particularly valuable because:
1. **Guaranteed visibility** - Every broadcast shows the logo
2. **Fan adoption** - Replica jerseys carry sponsor brands into everyday life
3. **Global reach** - Highlights and social media amplify exposure worldwide

The NHL approved helmet sponsorship during COVID (2020-21), generating **$2-5 million per team annually**. Full jersey sponsorship is expected within 5-10 years.

## Category Partnerships

Most teams sell **category-exclusive partnerships**: "official beer," "official airline," "official bank." These deals range from **$500,000 to $10 million annually**.

**High-Value Categories:**
- Automotive, financial services, telecommunications
- Alcoholic beverages, airlines, insurance

Category deals bundle:
- In-venue signage and PA announcements
- Broadcast integrations ("This power play brought to you by...")
- Digital content and social media features
- Hospitality and premium seating access

## Activation: Beyond the Logo

The best sponsors **activate** beyond logos—creating fan experiences that build positive associations:

❌ **Poor Activation:** Logo on a rink board. Fans barely notice.

✅ **Great Activation:** Scotiabank's "Scene+ Night" at Leafs games—loyalty program integration, exclusive ticket offers, in-arena experiences. Fans associate Scotiabank with positive memories.

✅ **Excellent Activation:** Delta's partnership with the Lakers includes exclusive lounges, travel content series, "Delta Deck" premium seating, and behind-the-scenes player content. Every touchpoint reinforces the brand-team connection.

The most sophisticated sponsors measure success through:
- **Brand awareness** (how many people saw/remembered the logo?)
- **Brand favorability** (did the sponsorship improve perception?)
- **Customer acquisition** (did we gain new customers?)
