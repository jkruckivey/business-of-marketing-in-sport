### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:30]**

**[ON-SCREEN: Title card with stadium imagery fading to animated revenue icons]**

**NARRATOR:**
Professional sports is a multi-billion dollar global industry. But where does all that money come from?

Most fans see ticket sales and merchandise. But the reality is far more complex—and fascinating.

In this video, you'll learn about the five major revenue streams that power professional sports leagues and teams. Understanding these streams is essential for analyzing sports business strategy.

Let's dive in.

---

**[SECTION 1: MEDIA RIGHTS - 1:00-3:00]**

**[ANIMATION: TV screens multiplying, broadcasting deals flowing as money streams]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Revenue Stream #1: Media Rights**

This is the foundation of modern sports economics. Media rights—broadcasting and streaming deals—typically represent **40-60% of total revenue** for major leagues.

**[ON-SCREEN: Graphic showing 40-60% highlighted in large text]**

Here's how it works: Leagues sell the rights to broadcast their games to media companies. These deals are massive—the NFL's current media rights deals total **$110 billion over 11 years**. That's $10 billion per year.

**[ANIMATION: Money flowing from broadcasters (logos: ESPN, NBC, Fox) to league office]**

Why do media companies pay so much? Three reasons:

**[ON-SCREEN: Three reasons appear as animated bullet points]**

**First: Live sports attract large, engaged audiences.** Unlike scripted TV, fans watch sports in real-time. No fast-forwarding through commercials.

**Second: Sports deliver valuable demographics.** Advertisers pay premium rates to reach sports fans—especially males 18-49 and high-income households.

**Third: Sports are "appointment viewing."** You can't watch a game "later" without risking spoilers. This predictable, simultaneous audience is rare in 2024.

**[DATA VISUALIZATION: CPM comparison chart]**

The result? Media companies can charge advertisers **$40-60 per thousand viewers** for premium sports—compared to $15-25 for primetime dramas.

**[TRANSITION: Media rights icon shrinks, ticketing icon grows]**

---

**[SECTION 2: TICKETING & LIVE EVENTS - 3:00-4:30]**

**[ANIMATION: Stadium filling with fans, ticket sales counter increasing]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Revenue Stream #2: Ticketing & Live Events**

This is where sports started—fans paying to watch games in person. Today, ticketing and live events represent **20-30% of total revenue**.

**[ON-SCREEN: Stadium cutaway showing different seating tiers]**

But it's not just basic tickets anymore. Modern teams have become experts at **revenue optimization** through three strategies:

**[ANIMATION: Three strategies highlighted]**

**Strategy 1: Dynamic Pricing**
Ticket prices adjust based on demand—opponent quality, team performance, day of week. The Toronto Raptors might charge $150 for a Tuesday game against the Pistons, but $400 for Saturday against the Lakers.

**Strategy 2: Premium Seating**
Luxury suites, club seats, and courtside packages generate **40-50% of ticketing revenue** despite representing only 10-15% of capacity. Some NBA courtside seats sell for $10,000-15,000 per season.

**Strategy 3: Beyond the Ticket**
The real money is what fans spend once they're inside: $10 beers, $8 hot dogs, $30 parking, $150 jerseys. Teams can generate **$40-50 per attendee** in non-ticket revenue.

**[DATA POINT ON-SCREEN]**

The challenge? Ticketing revenue is **capacity-constrained**. You can only sell so many seats. That's why teams focus on maximizing per-capita spending.

**[TRANSITION: Ticketing icon fades, sponsorship icon emerges]**

---

**[SECTION 3: SPONSORSHIP & PARTNERSHIPS - 4:30-6:00]**

**[ANIMATION: Corporate logos attaching to jerseys, stadiums, broadcasts]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Revenue Stream #3: Sponsorship & Partnerships**

Corporate sponsorships represent **15-25% of revenue** and come in many forms:

**[ON-SCREEN: Sponsorship types cascade in]**

- **Naming Rights:** Scotiabank Arena, Chase Center ($30-50 million per year)
- **Jersey Sponsors:** Rakuten on Golden State Warriors ($20-30 million per year)
- **Category Partnerships:** "Official beer," "official airline," "official bank"
- **In-venue advertising:** LED boards, court/field signage, branded lounges

**[ANIMATION: Split screen showing good vs. poor activation]**

But here's what most people miss: The best sponsorships aren't just logos. They're **experiences**.

**Poor activation:** Logo on a rink board. Fans barely notice.

**Great activation:** Scotiabank's "Scene+ Night" at Leafs games—loyalty program integration, exclusive ticket offers, in-arena experiences. Fans associate Scotiabank with positive memories.

**[DATA VISUALIZATION: Sponsorship ROI comparison]**

Sponsors measure success through:
- **Brand awareness** (how many people saw the logo?)
- **Brand favorability** (did the sponsorship improve perception?)
- **Customer acquisition** (did we gain new customers?)

The most sophisticated sponsors track all three.

**[TRANSITION: Sponsorship icon fades, merchandising icon appears]**

---

**[SECTION 4: MERCHANDISING & LICENSING - 6:00-7:00]**

**[ANIMATION: Jerseys, hats, video games flowing as revenue stream]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Revenue Stream #4: Merchandising & Licensing**

Apparel, licensed products, and video games represent **5-10% of revenue**—smaller than other streams, but still significant.

**[ON-SCREEN: Merchandise categories]**

In many leagues, this revenue is **centralized and shared equally**. The NHL, for example, pools all merchandise sales and distributes proceeds to all 32 teams.

Why? Because some teams (New York Yankees, Dallas Cowboys) would dominate sales, creating competitive imbalance.

**[ANIMATION: LeBron James jersey sales distribution]**

The exception: Individual player merchandise. When LeBron James's jersey sells, he gets a cut—but the team and league also benefit.

Merchandising spikes during:
- Championship runs (sales increase 200-400%)
- Star player acquisitions
- Milestone moments (record-breaking performances)

**[TRANSITION: Merchandising fades, betting icon emerges with "NEW" label]**

---

**[SECTION 5: BETTING & GAMING - 7:00-8:30]**

**[ANIMATION: Sports betting apps, data flowing, real-time odds]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Revenue Stream #5: Betting & Gaming (The New Frontier)**

This is the newest and **fastest-growing** revenue stream. Currently **2-8% of revenue**, but growing **30-40% year-over-year**.

**[TIMELINE ANIMATION: 2018 U.S. legalization → 2021 Canada legalization → 2024 widespread adoption]**

Since sports betting legalization, leagues generate billions through:

**[ON-SCREEN: Three revenue sources]**

1. **Betting Partnerships:** FanDuel, DraftKings, BetMGM pay leagues for "official partner" status ($50-200 million per year)

2. **Data Licensing:** Leagues sell real-time game data for live betting odds ($10-50 million per year)

3. **Media Integration:** Betting odds displayed in broadcasts drive fan engagement and sponsorship value

**[ANIMATION: Fan engagement metrics increasing with betting integration]**

The strategic insight? Betting doesn't just generate direct revenue—it **increases engagement** across other streams:

- Fans watch entire games (not just highlights) because they have bets riding on outcomes
- Betting drives mobile app usage, creating data valuable for sponsors
- In-game betting extends interest beyond casual fans

But there's controversy: Critics worry about integrity, addiction, and the impact on sports culture.

**[TRANSITION: All five icons appear on screen together]**

---

**[CONCLUSION: REVENUE INTERDEPENDENCE - 8:30-10:00]**

**[ANIMATION: Five revenue stream icons connecting with flowing lines, creating ecosystem web]**

**NARRATOR:**
Now here's the critical insight that ties everything together:

**These revenue streams don't exist in isolation. They're interconnected—an ecosystem, not a portfolio.**

**[ANIMATION: Investment flows through ecosystem]**

Watch how they interact:

**Example 1: The Star Player Effect**
A team signs a star player → Ticket sales increase → Better in-person atmosphere → More exciting TV broadcasts → Higher media rights value → More revenue to sign more stars.

**[ANIMATION: Virtuous cycle illustration]**

**Example 2: The Betting Integration Effect**
League partners with betting company → Betting odds displayed in broadcasts → Fans stay engaged longer → Higher TV ratings → More valuable to advertisers → Higher sponsorship revenue → More resources for betting features.

**[ON-SCREEN: Key Principle in large text]**

**"Investment in one revenue stream amplifies others."**

This is why the most successful sports organizations think in systems, not silos.

**[DATA EXAMPLE: Toronto Maple Leafs]**

The Toronto Maple Leafs haven't won a championship since 1967. Yet they're consistently one of the NHL's most valuable franchises.

Why? They built a revenue **ecosystem**:
- Sellout crowds at premium prices (ticketing)
- Strong local media rights (media)
- Deep-pocketed corporate sponsors (sponsorship)
- Massive merchandise sales (merchandising)
- Real estate assets (non-traditional revenue)

**[CLOSING - ON-SCREEN: Five key takeaways]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Key Takeaways:**

1. Five major revenue streams: Media rights (40-60%), Ticketing (20-30%), Sponsorship (15-25%), Merchandising (5-10%), Betting/Gaming (2-8% growing)

2. Media rights are the foundation—the largest and most strategic stream

3. Each stream has unique economics, risks, and growth potential

4. Revenue streams are **interdependent**—investment in one amplifies others

5. Successful organizations build ecosystems, not portfolios

In the next module, you'll hear from an industry executive who negotiates billion-dollar media deals. They'll share real-world examples of how these principles play out in practice.

## Video 2: Revenue Sharing - Why Sports Leagues Are Different (7-8 minutes)

**Purpose:** Deep dive on revenue sharing models before Canucks case study
**Placement:** Module 5 (Before Case Study)
**Visual Style:** Animated comparisons with financial data visualizations

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:30]**

**[ANIMATION: Various business logos (tech, retail, entertainment) with "COMPETE" overlay]**

**NARRATOR:**
In most industries, companies want to **destroy** their competitors. Apple vs. Samsung. Coke vs. Pepsi. Netflix vs. Disney.

**[TRANSITION: Stadium graphic with team logos circling]**

But professional sports are different.

**[ON-SCREEN: Text fades in]**
**"Sports leagues NEED their competitors to thrive."**

Why? Because competitive balance creates a better product. And a better product makes **everyone** more money.

This is the logic behind **revenue sharing**—one of the most unique features of sports economics.

Let's explore how it works.

---

**[SECTION 1: THE COMPETITIVE BALANCE PROBLEM - 0:30-2:30]**

**[ANIMATION: Two scenarios side-by-side]**

**NARRATOR:**
Imagine two versions of the NHL:

**Scenario A: No Revenue Sharing**
The New York Rangers generate $300 million per year. The Winnipeg Jets generate $150 million. The Rangers spend their advantage on star players. They win the Stanley Cup eight years in a row.

**[ANIMATION: Rangers logo growing, Jets logo shrinking]**

What happens?
- Jets fans stop watching (why watch if you can't compete?)
- National TV ratings decline (predictable outcomes are boring)
- Media companies pay less for rights (lower audience = lower value)
- EVERYONE loses revenue—including the Rangers

**[ANIMATION: Revenue declining for all teams]**

**Scenario B: Revenue Sharing**
The NHL shares 50% of centralized revenue equally among all teams. Now the Jets have $225 million to spend—not equal to the Rangers, but competitive.

**[ANIMATION: Revenue flowing from rich teams to poor teams via league office]**

Result?
- Jets remain competitive, fans stay engaged
- More games have playoff implications
- Higher TV ratings across all markets
- Higher media rights value
- EVERYONE makes more money

**[ON-SCREEN: Key Principle]**

**"Revenue sharing creates competitive balance, which increases total league revenue."**

But how much sharing is optimal? Different leagues have different philosophies.

---

**[SECTION 2: NFL MODEL - MAXIMUM SOCIALISM - 2:30-4:00]**

**[ANIMATION: NFL shield with equal distribution flowing to all 32 teams]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Model #1: The NFL—Maximum Socialism**

The NFL shares nearly **60% of all revenue** equally among its 32 teams.

**[DATA VISUALIZATION: Revenue breakdown]**

**What's shared:**
- National media rights → 100% shared
- NFL+ streaming revenue → 100% shared
- Merchandise and licensing → 100% shared
- Gate receipts → 60% shared (40% to home team)

**What's NOT shared:**
- Local sponsorships (team-specific deals)
- Stadium revenue (luxury suites, naming rights, concessions)

**[ON-SCREEN: Financial comparison]**

The result? The Green Bay Packers—a tiny market (population 105,000)—generate similar revenue to the New York Giants (population 8 million).

**[ANIMATION: Packers and Giants logos with similar revenue bars]**

**Philosophy:** "We're all in this together. A strong league benefits everyone more than a wealthy individual team."

**Impact:** The NFL has the highest competitive parity of any major league. In the past 20 years, 16 different teams have won the Super Bowl.

**[DATA POINT: Compare to other leagues with less parity]**

---

**[SECTION 3: NHL MODEL - MODERATE SHARING - 4:00-5:30]**

**[ANIMATION: NHL shield with 50% shared, 50% local]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Model #2: The NHL—Moderate Sharing**

The NHL takes a middle approach:

**[DATA VISUALIZATION: Split-screen showing centralized vs. local revenue]**

**Centralized Revenue (50% shared equally):**
- National media rights (U.S. and Canada)
- NHL.TV streaming
- Merchandise and licensing

**Local Revenue (team keeps 100%):**
- Local media rights (regional broadcasts)
- Ticket sales
- Local sponsorships
- Arena revenue

**[ANIMATION: High-revenue team paying into pool, low-revenue team receiving from pool]**

**Plus:** A **revenue sharing pool**. High-revenue teams pay in. Low-revenue teams receive payouts. This cushions the gap.

**[CASE EXAMPLE: Canadian teams]**

But here's the complication: **Currency exchange**.

Canadian teams earn revenue in Canadian dollars but pay players in U.S. dollars. When the exchange rate weakens (CAD $1 = USD $0.75), Canadian teams effectively lose 25% of their purchasing power.

**[ANIMATION: Currency fluctuation impact]**

This is why the Vancouver Canucks—a large, hockey-mad market—still struggle financially. Revenue sharing helps, but doesn't fully offset currency headwinds.

**[ON-SCREEN: Key Challenge]**

**"Revenue sharing creates baseline competitiveness, but doesn't eliminate all structural advantages."**

---

**[SECTION 4: PREMIER LEAGUE MODEL - TIERED DISTRIBUTION - 5:30-7:00]**

**[ANIMATION: English Premier League crest with unequal distribution]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Model #3: English Premier League—Tiered Distribution**

The Premier League represents a third philosophy: **Reward success, but maintain baseline competitiveness.**

**[DATA VISUALIZATION: Three-way revenue split]**

TV broadcast revenue is divided:
- **50% shared equally** among all 20 teams (baseline)
- **25% based on finishing position** (1st place gets more than 20th)
- **25% based on TV appearances** (popular teams get more airtime)

**[ANIMATION: Manchester City vs. bottom-table team revenue comparison]**

The result? **Wealth disparity**, but not extreme.

- Top teams (Manchester City, Liverpool) generate 3-4× more revenue than bottom teams
- Bottom teams still get enough to be competitive
- Promotion/relegation system creates stakes (finish last → drop to lower league)

**[COMPARISON CHART: Premier League vs. NFL parity metrics]**

**Impact:** Less parity than NFL (top teams dominate), but more exciting individual clubs (global fanbases for big teams drive international media revenue).

**[ON-SCREEN: Trade-off]**

**"Greater wealth disparity vs. Global superstar clubs."**

---

**[CONCLUSION: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR STRATEGY - 7:00-8:00]**

**[ANIMATION: Three models side-by-side comparison]**

**NARRATOR:**
So why does revenue sharing matter for sports marketing strategy?

**[ON-SCREEN: Three strategic implications]**

**Implication #1: It limits your strategic options.**
In the NFL, you can't simply "out-spend" competitors. Revenue is capped by sharing. You must out-execute operationally—better scouting, coaching, player development.

**Implication #2: It creates political tensions.**
Should the Dallas Cowboys' branding success subsidize the Jacksonville Jaguars? High-revenue teams sometimes resent sharing. This creates governance challenges.

**Implication #3: It affects team valuations.**
When investors buy teams, they model revenue potential. Leagues with strong revenue sharing (NFL) offer more **predictable, stable returns**. Leagues with less sharing (European soccer) are **higher risk, higher reward**.

**[CASE PREVIEW]**

In the next module, you'll analyze the Vancouver Canucks case study. You'll see how revenue sharing—and its limitations—affect strategic decisions for a team in a challenging market.

**[CLOSING SCREEN: Three key takeaways]**

**Key Takeaways:**
1. Sports leagues share revenue to maintain competitive balance
2. Three models: Maximum (NFL 60%), Moderate (NHL 50%), Tiered (EPL hybrid)
3. Revenue sharing affects strategic options, governance, and valuations

## Video 3: The Rogers NHL Deal - A $5.2 Billion Case Study (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Set up Week 2 Rogers case analysis with key context
**Placement:** Module 1 introduction OR Module 5 (before case reading)
**Visual Style:** Documentary-style with financial graphics and archival footage

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:45]**

**[ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE: Rogers deal announcement press conference, 2013]**

**NARRATOR:**
November 26, 2013. Rogers Communications shocked the sports media world.

**[ON-SCREEN: $5.2 BILLION - 12 YEARS]**

They outbid every competitor for exclusive Canadian NHL broadcasting rights—**$5.2 billion over 12 years**. The largest sports media deal in Canadian history.

**[NEWS CLIPS: Headlines fade in]**
- "Rogers Bets Big on Hockey"
- "Game-Changing Deal Reshapes Canadian Sports Media"
- "Did Rogers Overpay?"

**[NARRATOR:]**
At the time, analysts were divided. Some called it brilliant—locking up Canada's favorite sport. Others called it reckless—betting the company on a single property.

**[TRANSITION: Fast-forward graphic]**

**[ON-SCREEN: 2024]**

Ten years later, the verdict is in. Rogers lost money every single year. By some estimates, they lost **$1-1.5 billion** over the life of the deal.

But the story is more complex than "failed deal." There are lessons here about media strategy, risk management, and the future of sports broadcasting.

Let's examine what happened—and why.

---

**[SECTION 1: THE DEAL - WHAT ROGERS BOUGHT - 0:45-2:15]**

**[ANIMATION: Deal terms appearing as contract clauses]**

**NARRATOR:**
First, let's understand what Rogers acquired:

**[ON-SCREEN: Comprehensive rights breakdown]**

**All NHL Games in Canada:**
- National broadcasts (Hockey Night in Canada, Saturday nights)
- Regional broadcasts (Maple Leafs, Oilers, Flames, Canucks)
- Playoffs and Stanley Cup Finals
- NHL All-Star Game, Winter Classic, special events

**All Platforms:**
- Traditional TV (Sportsnet channels)
- Streaming (Sportsnet NOW app)
- Radio (Sportsnet Radio 590, 960)
- Digital (Sportsnet.ca)

**[DATA VISUALIZATION: Annual cost breakdown]**

**The Price:** $433 million per year
- 2.5× more than the previous deal ($1.4 billion over 10 years)
- More than Rogers paid for ALL other sports properties combined

**[COMPARISON CHART]**

To put this in perspective:
- TSN (Rogers' competitor) pays ~$150M/year for  CFL, NBA, FIFA World Cup, tennis, curling... COMBINED
- Rogers bet $433M/year on hockey alone

**[TRANSITION: Strategic rationale]**

---

**[SECTION 2: THE STRATEGIC BET - WHY ROGERS DID IT - 2:15-4:00]**

**[ANIMATION: Three strategic goals appearing]**

**NARRATOR:**
Why would Rogers pay so much? They had three strategic goals:

**[GOAL #1 - ANIMATION: Cable subscribers with "churn" flowing away, then stopping]**

**Goal #1: Defend Cable Subscribers**

In 2013, "cord-cutting" was beginning. Netflix was growing. Young people were canceling cable.

Rogers believed NHL hockey would **prevent churn**. If you're a hockey fan, you need Sportsnet. You can't cancel cable.

**[DATA MODEL ON-SCREEN: Subscriber retention projection]**

Rogers modeled that NHL rights would retain **500,000-1 million subscribers** who would otherwise cancel.

At $80/month cable bills, that's $480-960 million per year in retained revenue. The rights would pay for themselves through subscriber defense alone.

**[GOAL #2 - ANIMATION: Sportsnet brand growing, TSN shrinking]**

**Goal #2: Brand Domination**

Rogers wanted to be THE sports brand in Canada. Not #2 to TSN. THE leader.

Exclusive NHL rights would:
- Make Sportsnet the #1 sports network
- Attract other properties (NBA, soccer) who want to be on the leading platform
- Create leverage in sponsor negotiations

**[GOAL #3 - ANIMATION: Sportsnet NOW streaming app]**

**Goal #3: Build Streaming Business**

Rogers launched Sportsnet NOW in 2016 as their direct-to-consumer streaming service.

They believed NHL rights would drive **1+ million streaming subscribers** at $25/month. That's $300 million per year in new streaming revenue.

**[ON-SCREEN: Three goals with projected financial impact]**

**Total Projected Value:**
- Subscriber defense: $500-900M/year
- Brand positioning: $100M/year (sponsorship lift)
- Streaming revenue: $300M/year

**Total: $900M-1.3B per year**

Against $433M/year in costs? Sounds like a great deal!

**[DRAMATIC PAUSE]**

But it wasn't.

---

**[SECTION 3: WHAT WENT WRONG - THE THREE FATAL FLAWS - 4:00-7:30]**

**[SECTION TITLE: What Went Wrong]**

**[ANIMATION: Three warning symbols appearing]**

**NARRATOR:**
Rogers made three critical mistakes:

**[MISTAKE #1 - ANIMATION: Cable subscribers dropping faster than projected]**

**Fatal Flaw #1: Overestimated Subscriber Defense**

**[GRAPH: Projected vs. Actual subscriber retention]**

Rogers assumed hockey would prevent cord-cutting. It didn't.

Canadian cable/satellite subscribers:
- 2014: 11.2 million
- 2024: 8.1 million
- **Decline: 28%** (3.1 million subscribers lost)

**[INTERVIEWS: Quick soundbites from industry experts]**

Why? **Generational shift**. Millennials and Gen Z don't watch traditional TV—regardless of what's on it. They stream, watch highlights on YouTube, and follow social media.

**[DATA IMPACT ON-SCREEN]**

Financial impact: If Rogers retained only 200,000 subscribers instead of 500,000, that's **$288 million per year in lost revenue**. Over 12 years: **$3.5 billion** in missed projections.

**[MISTAKE #2 - ANIMATION: Sportsnet NOW subscriber growth vs. projection]**

**Fatal Flaw #2: Underinvested in Streaming**

Rogers launched Sportsnet NOW but made it **barebones:**
- Just live games (no replays, highlights, or shoulder content initially)
- No fantasy integration
- No social features
- Frequent technical issues (buffering, crashes)

**[COMPARISON: Split-screen showing NBA League Pass vs. Sportsnet NOW features]**

Compare to NBA League Pass:
- Multi-view (watch 4 games at once)
- Stats overlays
- Condensed replays (full game in 45 minutes)
- Classic games library

**[SUBSCRIBER GROWTH CHART]**

Sportsnet NOW Results:
- Year 1 (2016): 50K subscribers (projected 200K) ❌
- Year 3 (2018): 200K subscribers (projected 500K) ❌
- Year 5 (2020): 350K subscribers (projected 800K) ❌
- Year 8 (2024): 450K subscribers (projected 1.2M) ❌

**Missing target by 50-70% every year.**

**[ON-SCREEN: Revenue gap]**

Lost streaming revenue: **$150-200 million per year**

**[MISTAKE #3 - ANIMATION: COVID-19 impact timeline]**

**Fatal Flaw #3: No Flexibility for Black Swan Events**

March 2020: COVID-19 shuts down sports worldwide.

**[DATA VISUALIZATION: 2020-21 season impact]**

- Shortened season: 56 games instead of 82 (-32%)
- No fans in arenas (reduced atmosphere, lower ratings)
- Economic downturn (ad revenue collapsed by 40%)

But Rogers' contract had **no force majeure clause**. No revenue-sharing adjustment. No renegotiation trigger.

**[ON-SCREEN: Financial damage]**

Rogers still paid **full rights fees** ($433M) while generating only $200M in revenue.

**Loss in 2020-21 alone: $233 million**—their worst year of the deal.

**[DRAMATIC PAUSE]**

**[VISUAL: Three flaws summary screen]**

---

**[SECTION 4: WHAT ROGERS GOT RIGHT - 7:30-9:00]**

**[SECTION TITLE: What Went Right (Yes, Really)]**

**[NARRATOR:]**
It's easy to criticize. But Rogers did make some smart moves.

**[WIN #1 - ANIMATION: Linear + Streaming hybrid model]**

**Smart Move #1: Kept Linear + Streaming Hybrid**

Unlike pure streaming services (DAZN, Fubo), Rogers maintained strong linear TV while building streaming.

This **hedging strategy** paid off:
- Linear TV generated $2-2.5 billion in ad revenue (2014-2024)
- When streaming disappointed, linear kept them afloat

By 2024, even Netflix and Disney+ are adding linear-style experiences. Rogers was ahead of the curve.

**[WIN #2 - ANIMATION: Sportsnet brand equity growing]**

**Smart Move #2: Built Brand Equity**

Even though the deal lost money, Rogers gained:
- **Brand positioning:** Sportsnet became synonymous with NHL hockey
- **Content library:** 10+ years of broadcast history (replay value)
- **Production infrastructure:** Expertise reusable for other sports

**[VALUATION ESTIMATE]**

These intangible assets add **$500M-1B** to Rogers Media's valuation.

**[WIN #3 - ANIMATION: Lessons learned checklist]**

**Smart Move #3: Learned Expensive Lessons**

Rogers now knows what NOT to do:
- ✓ Don't overpay for exclusivity
- ✓ Invest in streaming UX from Day 1
- ✓ Model worst-case scenarios
- ✓ Include flexibility clauses
- ✓ Shorter deal terms (5-7 years max)

That institutional knowledge is worth **$500M+** in avoided future mistakes.

Rogers' recent deals (NBA, tennis) have been shorter-term, non-exclusive, and partnered—the opposite of the NHL approach.

---

**[CONCLUSION: LESSONS FOR THE INDUSTRY - 9:00-10:00]**

**[ANIMATION: Five lessons appearing]**

**NARRATOR:**
The Rogers NHL deal offers five lessons for sports media strategy:

**[ON-SCREEN: Five lessons with icons]**

**1. Strategic value must be measurable.**
"Subscriber defense" sounds good—but did Rogers track it rigorously? If not measurable, it's speculation.

**2. Content is table stakes. Experience drives retention.**
Having NHL rights wasn't enough. Fans needed a reason to choose Sportsnet NOW over cable, bars, or VPNs.

**3. Flexibility is worth the cost.**
A 12-year deal with no flexibility? Dangerous. Pay 5-10% more for force majeure clauses and opt-out windows.

**4. Partner to de-risk.**
Rogers could have co-bid with Apple, Amazon, or even TSN. Shared costs, shared risks, better technology.

**5. Know when to walk away.**
At $5.2 billion, the price exceeded rational limits. Sometimes NOT winning is the smartest move.

**[CLOSING VISUAL: Case analysis preview]**

**NARRATOR:**
In your case analysis, you'll examine the Rogers deal in detail—studying the financial exhibits, evaluating their strategic decisions, and recommending what they should do when the deal expires in 2026.

Use this framework to guide your thinking:
- What assumptions did Rogers make?
- Which assumptions proved wrong?
- What would YOU have done differently?

There's no single "right" answer. Strategic thinking is about making defensible decisions under uncertainty.

Good luck with your analysis.
