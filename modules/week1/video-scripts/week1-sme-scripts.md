## VIDEO #1 IO - Cohort - BOSM – W1-M3, V1 (Five Revenue Streams)

**Purpose:** Quick introduction to the five major revenue streams
**Placement:** Module 3 (Core Reading) - Before executive video
**Visual Style:** Clean animated graphics with data visualizations

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]**

**[ON-SCREEN: Five revenue stream icons appearing]**

**NARRATOR:**
Professional sports generates revenue from five major sources. Understanding these streams is essential for analyzing sports business strategy.

Let's break them down quickly.

---

**[SECTION: THE FIVE STREAMS - 0:15-1:45]**

**[ANIMATION: Each stream appears with percentage]**

**NARRATOR:**
Stream 1: Media Rights—40-60% of revenue. Broadcasting and streaming deals. The NFL's current media rights total $110 billion over 11 years. This is the foundation of modern sports economics.

Stream 2: Ticketing and Live Events—20-30%. Not just ticket sales—luxury suites, dynamic pricing, concessions, parking. Teams generate $40-50 per attendee beyond the ticket price.

Stream 3: Sponsorship and Partnerships—15-25%. Corporate deals like naming rights, jersey sponsors, and category partnerships. Scotiabank Arena pays $30-50 million per year for naming rights.

Stream 4: Merchandising and Licensing—5-10%. Jerseys, hats, video games. Often pooled and shared equally across teams to maintain competitive balance.

Stream 5: Betting and Gaming—2-8%, growing fast. The newest frontier. Leagues earn billions through betting partnerships, data licensing, and media integration. Growing 30-40% year-over-year.

---

**[CLOSING - 1:45-2:00]**

**[ANIMATION: Five streams connecting as ecosystem]**

**NARRATOR:**
Key insight: These streams don't exist in isolation. They're interconnected. Investment in one stream amplifies others.

Successful organizations build revenue ecosystems, not portfolios.

## VIDEO #2 IO - Cohort - BOSM – W1-M3, V2 (Sponsorship & Merchandising)

**Purpose:** Visual break at midpoint of Module 3; covers brand-driven revenue streams
**Placement:** Module 3, Element 12 (after ticketing, before detailed sponsorship text)
**Visual Style:** Clean animated graphics with brand logos and examples

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]**

**[ON-SCREEN: Brand logos (Scotiabank, Nike, FanDuel) surrounding sports team logos]**

**NARRATOR:**
While media rights and ticketing depend on the game itself, two revenue streams are driven by brand value: sponsorship and merchandising.

Let's see how teams monetize their brands through corporate partnerships and consumer products.

---

**[SECTION: SPONSORSHIP - 0:15-1:00]**

**[ANIMATION: Stadium with naming rights, jersey patches, in-venue signage]**

**NARRATOR:**
Sponsorship: 15-25% of Revenue.

The most visible sponsorship deals are naming rights: Scotiabank Arena in Toronto—$800 million over 20 years. That's $40 million per year just for the name.

**[ON-SCREEN: Jersey patch examples from NBA]**

Jersey sponsorship arrived in North America in 2017. The NBA allows a 2.5-inch patch on uniforms. Top deals reach $20-30 million per year—Golden State Warriors and Rakuten, $20 million annually.

**[ANIMATION: Sponsor activation examples]**

But the best sponsors don't just buy logos—they create experiences. Scotiabank's "Scene+ Night" at Leafs games integrates their loyalty program with ticket offers and in-arena experiences. Fans remember positive moments, not just a logo.

Key sponsorship categories: Naming rights at $15-50 million per year. Jersey and uniform patches at $5-30 million per year. Category partnerships—official bank, beer, airline—at $500K-10 million per year.

---

**[SECTION: MERCHANDISING - 1:00-1:45]**

**[ANIMATION: Jerseys, hats, merchandise flooding screen]**

**NARRATOR:**
Merchandising: 5-10% of Revenue.

Most major North American leagues—NFL, NHL, MLB—use a centralized model. The league manages all licensing, then splits revenue equally among teams. Why? Competitive balance. This prevents the Yankees and Cowboys from dominating merchandise sales and creating massive revenue gaps.

**[ON-SCREEN: LeBron Lakers jersey, Championship gear, City Edition designs]**

Revenue spikes during championship runs—sales see significant increases during peak playoff performance. Star acquisitions drive dramatic spikes—when LeBron James signed with the Lakers, his jersey sales saw a 600% spike within hours of the announcement. New designs generate consistent revenue—NBA "City Edition" jerseys generate over $100 million annually.

**[ANIMATION: Digital commerce icons]**

Digital commerce transformed merchandising—teams now sell globally without retail partnerships.

---

**[CLOSING - 1:45-2:00]**

**[ON-SCREEN: Sponsorship + Merchandising = Brand-Driven Revenue]**

**NARRATOR:**
Key insight: These are brand-driven revenue streams. The stronger your brand, the more valuable your sponsorship inventory and the more merchandise you sell.

Next up: Betting—the newest and fastest-growing revenue frontier.

**[ON-SCREEN: "Next: Betting & Gaming"]**

## VIDEO #3 IO - Cohort - BOSM – W1-M5, V1 (Revenue Sharing Models)

**Purpose:** Explain why and how leagues share revenue
**Placement:** Module 5 (Before Case Study)
**Visual Style:** Animated comparisons with simple financial graphics

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]**

**[ANIMATION: Team logos circling around league shield]**

**NARRATOR:**
Unlike most industries, professional sports leagues NEED their competitors to thrive. Why?

Because competitive balance creates a better product—and makes everyone more money.

This is the logic behind revenue sharing.

---

**[SECTION: THREE MODELS - 0:15-1:45]**

**[ANIMATION: Three league models side-by-side]**

**NARRATOR:**
Model 1: NFL—Maximum Socialism, 60% shared. Nearly all revenue is shared equally. Result? The Green Bay Packers—population 105,000—generate similar revenue to the New York Giants. Highest competitive parity in sports.

Model 2: NHL—Moderate Sharing, 50% shared. National media rights, streaming, and merchandise are shared. Local media rights and ticket sales stay with teams. Plus a revenue sharing pool for struggling teams.

The complication? Canadian teams earn in Canadian dollars but pay players in U.S. dollars. Currency fluctuations create major challenges.

Model 3: Premier League—Tiered Distribution. TV revenue split three ways: 50% equal, 25% based on finishing position, 25% based on TV appearances. Rewards success while maintaining baseline competitiveness.

---

**[CLOSING - 1:45-2:00]**

**[ON-SCREEN: Key principle]**

**NARRATOR:**
Why this matters: Revenue sharing limits strategic options, creates governance tensions, and affects team valuations.

In the Vancouver Canucks case, you'll see how revenue sharing—and currency headwinds—affect strategic decisions.

**[ON-SCREEN: "Next: Canucks Case Study"]**

## VIDEO #4 IO - Cohort - BOSM – W1-M7, V1 (Rogers NHL Deal)

**Purpose:** Quick context for Week 2 Rogers case study
**Placement:** Module 7 (Week 2 preview)
**Visual Style:** Mix of graphics and key data points

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]**

**[ON-SCREEN: "$5.2 BILLION - 12 YEARS"]**

**NARRATOR:**
November 2013: Rogers Communications paid $5.2 billion for exclusive Canadian NHL rights—12 years, all platforms, all games.

The largest sports media deal in Canadian history.

This deal presented a case study in media market disruption and strategic challenges.

---

**[SECTION: THE BET & THE CHALLENGES - 0:15-1:45]**

**[ANIMATION: Three strategic goals vs. market realities]**

**NARRATOR:**
Rogers' Three Strategic Goals:

Goal 1: Defend cable subscribers. They believed NHL rights would prevent cord-cutting. Reality: Canadian traditional TV subscriptions declined significantly during the contract period. Hockey alone couldn't reverse the industry shift to streaming.

Goal 2: Build streaming dominance. They projected 1+ million Sportsnet NOW subscribers. Reality: They reached only 450,000 by 2024—missing targets substantially every year.

Goal 3: Brand positioning. Become Canada's #1 sports network. Partial success: Sportsnet built brand equity, though questions remained about profitability margins.

**[DATA VISUALIZATION: Cost structure]**

Rogers' annual rights fees escalated from $300 million to $500 million across the contract period. The streaming platform did not generate sufficient offsetting revenue from subscriptions and advertising.

COVID Impact: 2020-21 season cancellation created payment pressures. Rogers paid full rights fees while generating minimal live content and had limited ability to renegotiate terms.

---

**[CLOSING - 1:45-2:00]**

**[ON-SCREEN: Key lessons]**

**NARRATOR:**
Lessons learned: Content alone isn't enough—streaming experience and platform architecture matter. Long-term rights deals require flexibility clauses for market disruptions. Media landscape disruption creates risks for fixed-price, multi-year commitments.

In Week 2, you'll analyze this deal in depth and examine what Rogers' strategic options are as the market evolves.
