## VIDEO #0 IO - Cohort - BOSM – W1-M0, V1 (The $100 Million Question)

**Purpose:** Hook students with Connor McDavid revenue paradox, introduce SME
**Placement:** Module 0 (Bridge-In) - First video in Week 1
**Duration:** 2:30
**Visual Style:** SME direct-to-camera with supporting slides

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:20] INTRODUCTION & CREDIBILITY**

**SME:**
"Hi, I'm [NAME], and I've spent [X] years working in professional sport—most recently as [ROLE] at [ORGANIZATION]. I've been on both sides of the table for deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

And I want to start this course with a problem that's kept me up at night."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "The $100 Million Question"]**

---

**[SECTION: THE PARADOX SETUP - 0:20-1:10]**

**SME:**
"Imagine you're the GM of an NHL team. You just signed Connor McDavid—the best player in hockey—to a $100 million, 8-year contract.

**[VISUAL CUE: Show slide with contract breakdown]**

That's $12.5 million per year. Your CFO tracks the immediate impacts:
- Ticket sales jump $5 million
- Jersey sales spike $3 million
- That's $8 million in new revenue

**[Pause, lean forward]**

Your board looks at these numbers and asks the obvious question: 'Why did we just LOSE $4.5 million per year on this deal?'"

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "$12.5M cost - $8M revenue = -$4.5M loss?"]**

---

**[SECTION: REFRAMING THE PROBLEM - 1:10-1:50]**

**SME:**
"Here's what I learned the hard way: If you're asking that question, you're measuring the WRONG things.

Because Connor McDavid isn't worth $8 million to your organization. He's worth $30 to $40 million per year.

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Actual Value: $30-40M/year"]**

The problem isn't the numbers. The problem is understanding how sport revenue works DIFFERENTLY than almost any other business.

There's a revenue ecosystem at play here—interdependencies that your CFO's spreadsheet will never capture. Media deals that hinge on star power. Sponsorships that activate around marquee players. Betting handles that spike when the best player in the world takes the ice."

---

**[CLOSING - 1:50-2:30] LEARNING CHALLENGE & CALL-TO-ACTION**

**SME:**
"This week, you're going to learn how to see that ecosystem. You'll map five major revenue streams in professional sport. You'll understand why they're interdependent. And by the end, you'll be able to defend that $100 million contract to a skeptical board—with numbers they can't argue with.

**[Pause]**

But first, I want to know: Do you ALREADY have the knowledge to solve this problem? Can you explain where that missing $22-32 million comes from?

Right now, before you learn anything this week, test yourself. Take the diagnostic exercise that follows this video. Be honest. Reveal your knowledge gaps NOW—so we can fill them together.

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Next: Diagnostic Exercise + Pre-Assessment"]**

Let's find out what you already know... and what you're about to discover."

**[END: 2:30]**

## VIDEO #1 IO - Cohort - BOSM – W1-M3, V1 (Five Revenue Streams)

**Purpose:** Quick introduction to the five major revenue streams
**Placement:** Module 3 (Core Reading) - Before executive video
**Visual Style:** Clean animated graphics with data visualizations

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]**

**[ON-SCREEN: Five revenue stream icons appearing]**

**NARRATOR:**
Professional sports generates revenue from five major sources. Understanding these streams is essential for analyzing sports business strategy.

Let's break them down quickly.

---

**[SECTION: THE FIVE STREAMS - 0:15-1:45]**

**[ANIMATION: Each stream appears with percentage]**

**NARRATOR:**
Stream 1: Media Rights—40-60% of revenue. Broadcasting and streaming deals. The NFL's current media rights total $110 billion over 11 years. This is the foundation of modern sports economics.

Stream 2: Ticketing and Live Events—20-30%. Not just ticket sales—luxury suites, dynamic pricing, concessions, parking. Teams generate $40-50 per attendee beyond the ticket price.

Stream 3: Sponsorship and Partnerships—15-25%. Corporate deals like naming rights, jersey sponsors, and category partnerships. Scotiabank Arena pays $30-50 million per year for naming rights.

Stream 4: Merchandising and Licensing—5-10%. Jerseys, hats, video games. Often pooled and shared equally across teams to maintain competitive balance.

Stream 5: Betting and Gaming—2-8%, growing fast. The newest frontier. Leagues earn billions through betting partnerships, data licensing, and media integration. Growing 30-40% year-over-year.

---

**[CLOSING - 1:45-2:00]**

**[ANIMATION: Five streams connecting as ecosystem]**

**NARRATOR:**
Key insight: These streams don't exist in isolation. They're interconnected. Investment in one stream amplifies others.

Successful organizations build revenue ecosystems, not portfolios.

**[ON-SCREEN: "Next: Revenue Mix Widget"]**

## VIDEO #2 IO - Cohort - BOSM – W1-M3, V2 (Sponsorship & Merchandising)

**Purpose:** Visual break at midpoint of Module 3; covers brand-driven revenue streams
**Placement:** Module 3, Element 12 (after ticketing, before detailed sponsorship text)
**Visual Style:** Clean animated graphics with brand logos and examples

### SCRIPT

---

**[SLIDE 1: SPONSORSHIP REVENUE - 0:00-0:45]**

**[ON-SCREEN: Arena exterior background. Tiered pyramid builds from top down.]**

**NARRATOR:**
While media rights and ticketing depend on the game itself, two revenue streams are driven by brand value: sponsorship and merchandising.

Let's see how teams monetize their brands through corporate partnerships and consumer products.

Sponsorship: 15-25% of Revenue.

The most visible sponsorship deals are naming rights: Scotiabank Arena in Toronto—$800 million over 20 years. That's $40 million per year just for the name.

**[On "naming rights": Top tier appears — Arena icon + "Naming Rights: $800M / 20 years = $40M/yr"]**

Jersey sponsorship arrived in North America in 2017. The NBA allows a 2.5-inch patch on uniforms. Top deals reach $20-30 million per year—Golden State Warriors and Rakuten, $20 million annually.

**[On "Jersey sponsorship": Middle tier appears — Jersey icon + "Jersey Patches: $20-30M/year"]**
**[On "Golden State Warriors and Rakuten": Base tier appears — Partner icons + "Category Partners: $5-20M/year"]**

---

**[SLIDE 2: ACTIVATION > LOGOS - 0:45-1:00]**

**[ON-SCREEN: New slide. Pyramid fades out.]**

**NARRATOR:**
But the best sponsors don't just buy logos—they create experiences. Scotiabank's "Scene+ Night" at Leafs games integrates their loyalty program with ticket offers and in-arena experiences. Fans remember positive moments, not just a logo.

**[On "Scene+ Night": Text "Scene+ Night" appears with loyalty program icon]**
**[On "Fans remember positive moments": Text "Activations drive engagement, not just logos" appears]**

Key sponsorship categories: Naming rights at $15-50 million per year. Jersey and uniform patches at $5-30 million per year. Category partnerships—official bank, beer, airline—at $500K-10 million per year.

**[On "Key sponsorship categories": Summary list builds — "Naming Rights: $15-50M/yr" → "Jersey Patches: $5-30M/yr" → "Category Partners: $500K-10M/yr"]**

---

**[SLIDE 3: MERCHANDISING REVENUE - 1:00-1:45]**

**[ON-SCREEN: New slide.]**

**NARRATOR:**
Merchandising: 5-10% of Revenue.

**[On "Merchandising: 5-10%": Jersey icon + "Merchandising: 5-10% of Revenue" appears]**

Most major North American leagues—NFL, NHL, MLB—use a centralized model. The league manages all licensing, then splits revenue equally among teams. Why? Competitive balance. This prevents the Yankees and Cowboys from dominating merchandise sales and creating massive revenue gaps.

**[On "centralized model": Text "Centralized Model: League manages licensing, splits equally" appears]**

Revenue spikes during championship runs—sales see significant increases during peak playoff performance. Star acquisitions drive dramatic spikes—when LeBron James signed with the Lakers, his jersey sales saw a 600% spike within hours of the announcement. New designs generate consistent revenue—NBA "City Edition" jerseys generate over $100 million annually.

**[On "LeBron James signed": Text "Star Acquisitions: LeBron Lakers jersey +600%" appears]**
**[On "City Edition": Text "New Designs: City Edition = $100M+ annually" appears]**

Digital commerce transformed merchandising—teams now sell globally without retail partnerships.

**[On "Digital commerce": Shopping cart icon + "Global sales without retail partners" appears]**

---

**[SLIDE 4: KEY INSIGHT - 1:45-2:00]**

**[ON-SCREEN: New slide.]**

**NARRATOR:**
Key insight: These are brand-driven revenue streams. The stronger your brand, the more valuable your sponsorship inventory and the more merchandise you sell.

**[On "brand-driven revenue streams": Text "Sponsorship + Merchandising = Brand-Driven Revenue" appears]**
**[On "stronger your brand": Text "Stronger brand = more valuable inventory + more sales" appears]**

Next up: Betting—the newest and fastest-growing revenue frontier.

**[On "Next up: Betting": Text "Next: Betting & Gaming" appears]**

## VIDEO #3 IO - Cohort - BOSM – W1-M5, V1 (Revenue Sharing Models)

**Purpose:** Explain why and how leagues share revenue
**Placement:** Module 5 (Before Case Study)
**Visual Style:** Animated comparisons with simple financial graphics

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]**

**[ANIMATION: Team logos circling around league shield]**

**NARRATOR:**
Unlike most industries, professional sports leagues NEED their competitors to thrive. Why?

Because competitive balance creates a better product—and makes everyone more money.

This is the logic behind revenue sharing.

---

**[SECTION: THREE MODELS - 0:15-1:45]**

**[ANIMATION: Three league models side-by-side]**

**NARRATOR:**
Model 1: NFL—Maximum Socialism, 60% shared. Nearly all revenue is shared equally. Result? The Green Bay Packers—population 105,000—generate similar revenue to the New York Giants. Highest competitive parity in sports.

Model 2: NHL—Moderate Sharing, 50% shared. National media rights, streaming, and merchandise are shared. Local media rights and ticket sales stay with teams. Plus a revenue sharing pool for struggling teams.

The complication? Canadian teams earn in Canadian dollars but pay players in U.S. dollars. Currency fluctuations create major challenges.

Model 3: Premier League—Tiered Distribution. TV revenue split three ways: 50% equal, 25% based on finishing position, 25% based on TV appearances. Rewards success while maintaining baseline competitiveness.

---

**[CLOSING - 1:45-2:00]**

**[ON-SCREEN: Key principle]**

**NARRATOR:**
Why this matters: Revenue sharing limits strategic options, creates governance tensions, and affects team valuations.

In the Vancouver Canucks case, you'll see how revenue sharing—and currency headwinds—affect strategic decisions.

**[ON-SCREEN: "Next: Canucks Case Study"]**

## VIDEO #4 IO - Cohort - BOSM – W1-M7, V1 (Rogers NHL Deal)

**Purpose:** Quick context for Week 2 Rogers case study
**Placement:** Module 7 (Week 2 preview)
**Visual Style:** Mix of graphics and key data points

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]**

**[ON-SCREEN: "$5.2 BILLION - 12 YEARS"]**

**NARRATOR:**
November 2013: Rogers Communications paid $5.2 billion for exclusive Canadian NHL rights—12 years, all platforms, all games.

The largest sports media deal in Canadian history.

This deal presented a case study in media market disruption and strategic challenges.

---

**[SECTION: THE BET & THE CHALLENGES - 0:15-1:45]**

**[ANIMATION: Three strategic goals vs. market realities]**

**NARRATOR:**
Rogers' Three Strategic Goals:

Goal 1: Defend cable subscribers. They believed NHL rights would prevent cord-cutting. Reality: Canadian traditional TV subscriptions declined significantly during the contract period. Hockey alone couldn't reverse the industry shift to streaming.

Goal 2: Build streaming dominance. They projected 1+ million Sportsnet NOW subscribers. Reality: They reached only 450,000 by 2024—missing targets substantially every year.

Goal 3: Brand positioning. Become Canada's #1 sports network. Partial success: Sportsnet built brand equity, though questions remained about profitability margins.

**[DATA VISUALIZATION: Cost structure]**

Rogers' annual rights fees escalated from $300 million to $500 million across the contract period. The streaming platform did not generate sufficient offsetting revenue from subscriptions and advertising.

COVID Impact: 2020-21 season cancellation created payment pressures. Rogers paid full rights fees while generating minimal live content and had limited ability to renegotiate terms.

---

**[CLOSING - 1:45-2:00]**

**[ON-SCREEN: Key lessons]**

**NARRATOR:**
Lessons learned: Content alone isn't enough—streaming experience and platform architecture matter. Long-term rights deals require flexibility clauses for market disruptions. Media landscape disruption creates risks for fixed-price, multi-year commitments.

In Week 2, you'll analyze this deal in depth and examine what Rogers' strategic options are as the market evolves.
