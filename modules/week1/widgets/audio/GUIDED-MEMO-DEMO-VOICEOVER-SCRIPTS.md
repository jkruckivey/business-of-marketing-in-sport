## Step 1: Introduction

**Audio file:** `guided-memo-step1-introduction.mp3`
**Duration:** ~45 seconds

Hi, I'm Matt Diamond. In the next few minutes, I'm going to walk you through exactly how I'd approach this executive memo assignment.

I'll show you my thinking process—including the parts where I get stuck and have to revise. This isn't about writing a perfect draft on the first try. It's about having a system.

Let's write this together.

---

## Step 2: Understanding the Prompt

**Audio file:** `guided-memo-step2-prompt.mp3`
**Duration:** ~60 seconds

---

First, I always read the prompt twice. Let me highlight the key requirements.

One-page memo. Advising a private equity firm. Unique characteristics of sport's revenue model. Two to three investment decision factors.

So I need to do two things: explain what makes sports different, and give them actionable guidance. Both are equally important.

Let me check the rubric. Revenue Stream Analysis is worth 10 points. Investment Factors is 10 points. These are equally weighted—I shouldn't spend 80% of my memo on one and ignore the other.

I'm going to sketch a quick outline before I write. Opening to set up the context. Section one on how sports revenue is unique. Section two with two to three factors for investment decisions. And a closing with a bottom-line recommendation.

This takes five minutes and saves me from writing something that doesn't answer the question.

---

## Step 3: Writing the Header

**Audio file:** `guided-memo-step3-header.mp3`
**Duration:** ~45 seconds

---

I'll start with the memo header. This is standard business format, but details matter.

TO: Brookfield Capital Investment Committee. Not just "Investment Committee"—use the full name.

FROM: Your name, Sports Business Consultant. Your title tells them why you're qualified to write this.

DATE: Today's date. Simple, but I've seen students forget this.

RE: Professional Sports Team Investment Analysis. Make the subject line specific. "Sports Investment" is too vague.

This header takes 30 seconds to write, but it signals professionalism before they read a single word of your analysis.

---

## Step 4: Writing the Analysis

**Audio file:** `guided-memo-step4-analysis.mp3`
**Duration:** ~75 seconds

---

Now the opening. Executives don't want fluff—I need to get straight to the point.

Watch what I'm typing: "Professional sports teams operate under a fundamentally different economic model than traditional businesses. Before committing 500 million to one billion dollars, you must understand three characteristics that create both opportunity and risk."

See how I'm setting up expectations? They know I'm going to cover three things. Now I need to deliver on that promise.

First characteristic: revenue ecosystem interdependence. Let me pull data from the course.

"Media rights represent 55% of NHL revenue and depend on competitive balance maintained through revenue sharing." That's a specific claim with a specific number.

Now I'll add the Predators case reference: "The Nashville Predators case demonstrates this—despite market challenges, the team must evaluate how different markets would affect their revenue mix."

I've made a claim, supported it with course data, and connected it to the case study. That's the pattern. Claim, evidence, application.

---

## Step 5: Investment Factors

**Audio file:** `guided-memo-step5-factors.mp3`
**Duration:** ~60 seconds

---

Now for the investment factors section. The rubric says "specific, defensible factors backed by evidence."

I'm thinking like Sarah Chen—our PE investor. If I were investing 500 million dollars, what would I actually care about? Downside protection and upside potential.

Let me frame it that way.

"Two factors should guide your investment decision.

Factor one: Revenue sharing structure. Leagues with robust sharing protect downside risk. Calculate the floor revenue a team receives regardless of performance."

That's specific and actionable. Not just "look at revenue sharing"—I'm telling them exactly what to calculate.

"Factor two: Emerging stream exposure. Evaluate the team's position in betting partnerships and digital content rights. These streams—projected 15 to 20 percent of revenue by 2030—sit outside traditional sharing pools."

I'm citing a specific projection and explaining why it matters for their return.

---

## Step 6: Revision and Polish

**Audio file:** `guided-memo-step6-revision.mp3`
**Duration:** ~60 seconds

---

I have a draft. Now let me check if everything earns its place.

First, word count. I'm at 420 words, and the limit is 500. Good—I have room to breathe, but I shouldn't pad it.

This sentence is redundant—delete. "In order to" can just be "to." I said "unique" twice in the same paragraph—let me vary my language.

Now the rubric check. Revenue streams analyzed? Yes, I covered media rights and interdependencies. Investment factors? Yes, two specific factors with evidence. Business communication? Memo format, clear writing—looks good.

One more thing. Do I have a clear bottom-line recommendation?

I'll add: "Recommendation: Sports teams are not traditional businesses, but with proper due diligence on league revenue structures and emerging stream potential, they offer attractive risk-adjusted returns. I recommend proceeding to Phase 2 due diligence."

That's a clear verdict. I'm not hedging—I'm making the call they hired me to make.

---

## Step 7: Summary

**Audio file:** `guided-memo-step7-summary.mp3`
**Duration:** ~45 seconds

---

That's it. Total time from blank page to finished draft: about 45 minutes for me, and that's with experience. Give yourself 60 to 90 minutes for your first draft.

Here are the key takeaways:

One: Read the prompt and rubric before writing. Know what you're being graded on.

Two: Make an outline to organize your thinking. Five minutes of planning saves 30 minutes of rewriting.

Three: Support every claim with specific evidence. Numbers, case references, widget outputs.

Four: Revise for concision. Every word should earn its place.

Five: Check your draft against the rubric before submitting.

You've got this. Now go write your memo.
