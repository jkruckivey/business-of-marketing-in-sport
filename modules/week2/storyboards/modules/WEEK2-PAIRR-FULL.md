# Phase 2A: Peer Feedback Instructions (2 Points Bonus)

After completing your draft memo, you'll review a classmate's draft.

## How to Provide Effective Peer Feedback:

### Step 1: Read the Draft (10 minutes)
- Read your classmate's complete draft memo
- Note strengths and areas for improvement
- Refer to the 40-point rubric (Element 8) for grading criteria

### Step 2: Evaluate Using Rubric (15 minutes)

**Deal Evaluation (12 points)**
- Does the memo apply Week 2 frameworks (rights valuation, platform economics, fan engagement)?
- Is the analysis supported by specific evidence from case data?
- Does it demonstrate nuanced understanding of Rogers' strategic rationale vs. financial outcomes?
- **Feedback:** What's strong? What needs more framework application or data support?

**Mistake Identification (10 points)**
- Are 2-3 specific mistakes identified with supporting evidence from exhibits?
- Does the analysis go beyond obvious errors to reveal strategic misjudgments?
- **Feedback:** What's strong? What needs more specificity or evidence?

**Strategic Recommendations (10 points)**
- Is the 2026 recommendation specific and actionable?
- Are recommendations defensible with evidence and market analysis?
- Are trade-offs and risks acknowledged?
- **Feedback:** What's strong? What's missing from the strategy?

**Application of Concepts (5 points)**
- Does the memo apply concepts from readings, executive session, and simulation?
- Are relevant connections made demonstrating integrated learning?
- **Feedback:** What's strong? Where could connections be strengthened?

**Business Communication (3 points)**
- Professional memo format? Clear writing? Within 1000 words?
- **Feedback:** What's strong? Any clarity issues?

### Step 3: Write Constructive Feedback (10 minutes)

Provide 400-600 word feedback addressing:
1. **What's Working Well:** 2-3 specific strengths
2. **What Needs Improvement:** 3-4 specific weaknesses with suggestions
3. **Priority Revision:** If limited time, what's the ONE most important fix?

**Example Feedback:**
"Strong application of platform economics framework in your deal evaluation! You clearly explained why Rogers' linear + streaming strategy struggled. For improvement: Your mistake identification could be more specific. Instead of 'Rogers overestimated streaming,' reference the exact subscriber gap from Widget 6 (projected 1M vs. actual 450K = 55% shortfall). This quantification strengthens your argument significantly."

### Step 4: Submit Peer Feedback

Submit via peer feedback submission box (Element 11) by Day 5.

**Grading:** 2 points bonus for completing thorough peer review.

# Phase 2B: AI Feedback Instructions (1 Point Bonus)

After completing your draft, generate AI feedback using ChatGPT.

## How to Generate AI Feedback:

### Step 1: Copy the Prompt Template (2 minutes)

Copy this entire prompt into ChatGPT:

```
You are a strategic advisor reviewing a media rights deal analysis memo for an MBA course focused on the Business of Marketing in Sport.

Review the draft below using these criteria:

**Deal Evaluation (12 points):**
Does the memo apply Week 2 frameworks (rights valuation drivers, platform economics, fan engagement monetization)? Is analysis supported by specific case evidence? Does it show nuanced understanding of strategic rationale vs. financial outcomes?

**Mistake Identification (10 points):**
Are 2-3 specific mistakes identified with supporting evidence from exhibits? Does analysis go beyond obvious errors to reveal strategic misjudgments?

**Strategic Recommendations (10 points):**
Is the 2026 recommendation specific and actionable? Are recommendations defensible with evidence? Are trade-offs/risks acknowledged?

**Application of Concepts (5 points):**
Does the memo effectively apply concepts from readings, executive sessions, and simulations?

**Business Communication (3 points):**
Professional memo format? Clear, concise writing? Within word limit?

Provide feedback in this format:
1. **What's Working Well:** 2-3 specific strengths
2. **What Needs Improvement:** 3-4 specific weaknesses with actionable suggestions
3. **Priority Revision:** If limited time, what's the ONE most important fix?

Here is the draft memo:
[PASTE YOUR DRAFT HERE]

### Step 3: Generate and Save Feedback (5 minutes)

- Click "Send" in ChatGPT
- Read the AI-generated feedback carefully
- Copy the full response
- Paste into AI Feedback Submission Box (Element 12)

### Step 4: Submit AI Feedback

Submit the ChatGPT response via Element 12 by Day 5.

**Grading:** 1 point bonus for completing AI feedback generation.

**Note:** You're not graded on the quality of AI feedback (that's out of your control). You're graded on successfully generating and submitting it as evidence you engaged with AI-assisted learning.

## Element 12: **NEW** - Phase 3: Comparative Reflection

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Text** element
2. Copy markdown below:

```markdown
# Phase 3: Comparative Reflection (1 Point Bonus)

Now that you've received both peer feedback and AI feedback, compare them.

## Reflection Prompt:

Write 300-400 words comparing the peer feedback you received vs. the AI feedback you generated. Address:

### 1. Quality Comparison (150-200 words)
- Which feedback was more specific? More actionable?
- Did peer feedback catch anything AI missed (or vice versa)?
- Which feedback better understood the context of the Rogers case?
- Were there contradictions between peer and AI feedback? If so, which did you trust more and why?

### 2. Usefulness for Revision (100-150 words)
- Which feedback will most influence your revision? Why?
- Did one source identify a "priority fix" you hadn't considered?
- Were there suggestions you plan to ignore? Why?

### 3. AI Literacy Insight (50 words)
- What did this exercise teach you about AI's strengths and limitations for strategic analysis?

**Example Excerpt:**
"My peer reviewer provided more context-specific feedback, noting that my 2026 recommendation didn't address TSN's competitive response (something only someone familiar with Canadian sports media would catch). However, the AI feedback was more systematic in checking rubric alignment—it caught that I completely missed discussing fan engagement monetization in my deal evaluation. The contradiction was interesting: my peer said my mistake identification was 'strong,' while AI said it 'lacked specificity and exhibit references.' Reviewing my draft again, AI was right—I made general claims without citing Widget 6 data. For revision, I'll prioritize AI's specificity suggestion (add exhibit numbers) and peer's strategic insight (address competitive dynamics)..."

**Grading:** 1 point bonus for thoughtful comparative reflection (300-400 words).

Submit via Element 13 by Day 5.

## Element 13: **NEW** - Phase 5: Post-Revision Reflection

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Text** element
2. Copy markdown below:

```markdown
# Phase 5: Post-Revision Reflection (1 Point Bonus)

After submitting your final revised memo, reflect on your revision process.

## Reflection Prompt:

Write 200-300 words reflecting on which feedback most influenced your final revision. Address:

### 1. Revision Choices (150-200 words)
- Which specific feedback did you incorporate? (Reference peer or AI by name/type)
- What changes did you make to your memo based on feedback?
- Was there feedback you chose NOT to incorporate? Why?
- Did you make any revisions that weren't suggested by either peer or AI?

### 2. Learning About Feedback (50-100 words)
- What did this process teach you about using feedback effectively?
- Will you approach peer review or AI tools differently in future assignments?

**Example Excerpt:**
"I incorporated 4 major revisions: (1) Added specific exhibit references to all mistake claims [AI feedback], (2) Expanded platform economics analysis to compare Rogers' strategy vs. DAZN multi-sport approach [peer feedback], (3) Addressed TSN competitive response in my 2026 recommendation [peer feedback], (4) Cut 200 words of fluff to stay under word limit [AI feedback]. I chose NOT to incorporate peer's suggestion to recommend 'walk away entirely' for 2026—while I appreciated the boldness, the case evidence doesn't support abandoning NHL rights given Sportsnet's brand identity. I also made one revision neither source suggested: I added a risk mitigation table for my split-package recommendation, inspired by the Streaming Wars simulation format. This process taught me that AI is better at systematic rubric checking while peers catch strategic nuances. Going forward, I'll use AI first for completeness checks, then peer review for strategic soundness..."

**Grading:** 1 point bonus for thoughtful post-revision reflection (200-300 words).
