### Video Script: "The $5.2 Billion Question" (SME Direct-to-Camera)

**Recording Setup:** SME on camera, professional background, teleprompter optional

```
[0:00-0:20] INTRODUCTION & CREDIBILITY

SME: "Hi, I'm [NAME], and I've spent [X] years working in sports media—
negotiating rights deals, building streaming platforms, and trying to figure out
how much live sports are actually worth.

And I want to start Week 2 with a deal that haunts every media executive I know."

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "The $5.2 Billion Question"]


[0:20-1:10] THE PARADOX SETUP

SME: "In 2013, Rogers Communications paid $5.2 billion for exclusive Canadian NHL rights.
12 years. Every game. Every platform. Complete control.

[VISUAL CUE: Show slide with deal structure]

The previous deal? $1.8 billion for 10 years.

Rogers just paid nearly 3× more PER YEAR than the previous deal.

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Previous: $180M/year → Rogers: $433M/year"]

Their projections showed break-even by Year 5 and profitability by Year 7.

[Pause, lean forward]

Ten years later? They never achieved profitability. Not once.

Cumulative losses: over $1.5 billion.

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "10 years later: -$1.5B total losses"]


[1:10-1:50] REFRAMING THE PROBLEM

SME: "Here's what puzzles me: Rogers has some of the smartest media strategists
in North America. They had a decade of financial data. They understood the Canadian
hockey market better than anyone.

So what went wrong?

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "How do you value something worth billions?"]

Here's the thing: They didn't mess up the math. They messed up the ASSUMPTIONS.

Cord-cutting accelerated faster than anyone predicted. Streaming economics turned
out completely different than broadcast economics. And COVID-19—a black swan
no one saw coming—devastated Year 7 revenue.

But here's the question that matters for YOU:

If Rogers' team couldn't get this right, how do YOU value a media rights deal?


[1:50-2:30] THE CHALLENGE

SME: "This week, you're going to learn the frameworks media executives use to price
sports content. You'll understand why sports are the last 'appointment viewing'
that commands premium valuations. And you'll analyze the Rogers deal yourself—
using actual financial data—to figure out where their projections went wrong.

By Friday, you'll be able to walk into a room with a media buyer and understand
exactly how they're thinking about a billion-dollar rights deal.

But first, I need to know: Do you understand how media rights are valued RIGHT NOW?

Before you learn Week 2's frameworks, let's see where you stand. The next exercise
is a diagnostic conversation—not graded, just revealing. It'll show you exactly
what you need to learn this week.

Ready? Let's find out what you know—and what you don't—about valuing media rights."

## Element 2: AI Roleplay - Media Rights Valuation Diagnostic

**Widget Type:** AI Roleplay (Uplimit built-in element)
**Purpose:** Diagnostic conversation revealing knowledge gaps about media rights valuation (formative, not graded)
**Estimated Time:** 5-7 minutes
**Learning Outcome Supported:** Prepares for WLO 2.1 (media rights valuation) and WLO 2.4 (evaluating Rogers deal)

### UPLIMIT CONFIGURATION

**Tab 1: Learning Objective**

**Name:** Media Rights Valuation Diagnostic

**Learning Objective:**
Students will articulate their current understanding of how media rights deals are valued, revealing knowledge gaps and misconceptions before learning Week 2 frameworks. This diagnostic conversation (formative, not graded) helps students identify what they need to focus on during the week.

**Scenario Setup:**
You are a **media strategy consultant** hired by a professional sports league. Your client (the AI) is the league commissioner who needs to understand media rights valuation before negotiating their next rights deal. They ask you to explain how they should value their content when talking to broadcasters and streaming platforms.

---

**Tab 2: Scenario**

Copy this into the **Scenario** field:

```
You are the Commissioner of a professional sports league preparing to negotiate your next media rights deal. Your current deal expires in 12 months, and you're meeting with a media strategy consultant (the student) to understand how to value your content.

You've heard about the Rogers/NHL deal ($5.2B over 12 years) that never became profitable, and you want to avoid making similar mistakes.

Your role is to ask probing Socratic questions that help the student reveal their current understanding of media rights valuation—while gently exposing gaps in their knowledge.

**Conversation Flow:**

1. **Opening**: Thank the student for joining and ask them to explain, in simple terms, how sports leagues should value their media rights when negotiating with broadcasters or streaming platforms.

2. **Follow-up questions** (adapt based on student responses):
   - "You mentioned [X factor]. How would you quantify that? What's the formula?"
   - "Linear broadcasting vs. streaming—do those have the same economics?"
   - "If I have 5 million viewers per game, what should I charge per year?"
   - "What role does exclusivity play in pricing?"
   - "How should I think about guaranteed fees vs. revenue share deals?"

3. **Gentle challenges** (when student gives incomplete or incorrect answers):
   - "That's part of it, but media buyers tell me they also consider [Y]. How does that fit into your model?"
   - "Interesting. But the Rogers deal projected $433M/year and never hit profitability. What did they miss?"

4. **Closing** (after 3-4 exchanges):
   - Acknowledge what the student got right
   - Point out 1-2 specific areas where their understanding is incomplete
   - Say: "You've got some good intuitions, but there are frameworks we use in the industry that would sharpen your thinking. That's exactly what you'll learn this week. Ready to dive into the valuation models?"

**Tone:** Professional, curious, gently Socratic (not confrontational)

**Goal:** Help students discover WHERE their knowledge gaps are so they know what to focus on during Week 2.

**Tab 3: Instructions for Students**

Copy this into the **Instructions for Students** field:

```markdown
### Your Role
You are a **media strategy consultant** hired by a professional sports league. The league commissioner (AI) needs to understand how to value media rights before negotiating their next deal.

### Getting Started
**You need to start the conversation.** When the chat opens, begin by explaining (in simple terms) how you think sports leagues should value their media rights when talking to broadcasters or streaming platforms.

### The Scenario
The commissioner knows about the Rogers/NHL $5.2B deal that never became profitable, and they want to avoid similar mistakes. They're going to ask you probing questions to understand your approach.

### What to Have Ready
- **Your current understanding** of what makes sports content valuable (it's okay if this is limited!)
- **Your best attempt** at explaining how to price a media rights deal
- **Curiosity** about what you DON'T know yet

### Your Goal
⚠️ **This is diagnostic—you're not expected to ace this!** Most students struggle before learning Week 2 content. The goal is to:

1. Start the conversation with your best attempt at explaining media rights valuation
2. Respond to the commissioner's probing questions using your current knowledge
3. Discover gaps in your understanding (this is GOOD—it shows you what to focus on)
4. Get motivated to learn the valuation frameworks that would help you answer confidently

### Conversation Length
- **3-4 exchanges** with the commissioner
- The AI will probe your understanding with 2-3 follow-up questions after your opening explanation
- If you get stuck, that's the point! Notice where you struggle—those are your learning priorities.

### What Happens Next
After this exercise, you'll take a pre-assessment quiz that helps you identify exactly what you need to learn. By the end of Week 2, you'll return to this question and answer it confidently using media rights valuation frameworks.
```

**Tab 4: Grading Rubric**

**Grading:** Not graded (formative diagnostic only)

**Why Not Graded:**
This is a formative assessment designed to reveal knowledge gaps BEFORE learning begins. Students should feel safe exploring and making mistakes. Grading would create anxiety and discourage honest engagement.

**Completion Credit:**
Students receive completion credit for engaging with the AI roleplay (tracked by Uplimit automatically). Actual understanding is measured by the Week 2 Mini-Case Memo assessment.

**Priority:** ⬤ Required

```
Title: ⚠️ The $5.2 Billion Question

In 2013, Rogers Communications paid $5.2 billion for exclusive Canadian NHL rights—
nearly 3× more per year than the previous deal. Their projections showed profitability
by Year 7.

Ten years later: They never achieved profitability. Cumulative losses exceeded $1.5 billion.

**The Strategic Challenge:**

Rogers had the best media strategists, a decade of financial data, and deep understanding
of the Canadian hockey market. Yet their valuation was catastrophically wrong.

**This Week's Question:**

How do you value something worth billions—when even experts get it wrong?

You'll learn the frameworks media executives use to price sports content, understand why
their assumptions failed, and develop the skills to evaluate billion-dollar deals yourself.

**But first**: The diagnostic exercises below reveal what you understand NOW about media
rights valuation—before you learn Week 2's frameworks. This helps you identify exactly
where to focus your learning energy this week.

## Week 2 Challenge: Evaluate the Rogers/NHL Deal

By Friday, you'll be able to:

**Analyze** Rogers Communications' $5.2B NHL deal using media rights valuation frameworks

**Compare** linear broadcasting vs. streaming platform economics and assess Rogers' strategic choices

## Module Summary

**What You've Accomplished:**
You've been hooked by a real media rights disaster—the Rogers/NHL $5.2B deal that never achieved profitability—and you've taken your first steps toward understanding it. Through the diagnostic conversation and pre-assessment quiz, you've discovered exactly where your media strategy knowledge stands. That clarity isn't a weakness—it's your competitive advantage for this week.

**Key Insight:**
The fact that you struggled with valuation questions in the diagnostic is expected. Media rights economics is MORE COMPLEX than most revenue streams because you're predicting consumer behavior 10-15 years into the future (cord-cutting, streaming adoption, platform economics). Even experts with decades of data get it wrong. Week 2 teaches you the frameworks that improve your odds—but Module 0 taught you humility: always stress-test your assumptions and plan for scenarios where you're wrong.

**Up Next: Module 1 - Learning Outcomes**
Now that you've seen the problem and identified your knowledge gaps, Module 1 will show you exactly what you're going to learn this week—and how Week 2's frameworks synthesize with Week 1's revenue ecosystem thinking. You'll see the four key challenges you'll be able to solve by Friday, transforming you from someone who sees the Rogers deal as a mysterious failure into someone who can confidently evaluate billion-dollar media rights strategies.

Ready to turn those knowledge gaps into strategic capabilities? Let's define your learning path.
