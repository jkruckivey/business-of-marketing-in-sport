### 💼 Project Preview: Week 2 → Final Strategic Vision

This week's media rights expertise is essential for your **Week 5 capstone**. Your Strategic Vision Memo must include a media strategy that justifies platform choices (linear vs. streaming), projects content value, and explains how your property will monetize fan engagement.

By understanding how mega-deals like Rogers' $5.2B NHL rights are valued and why they succeed or struggle, you'll be equipped to recommend realistic media partnerships and revenue projections for your chosen sports property.

**WLO 2.2: Compare linear broadcasting to streaming/DTC models** (Bloom's: Analyze)

**WLO 2.3: Describe fan engagement monetization strategies** (Bloom's: Understand)
Identify how platforms extend value beyond passive viewing through interactive features, betting integration, social engagement, and multi-platform distribution to maximize advertising, subscription, and sponsorship revenue.

### Text Content (week2-intro.docx):
```
Media Rights: The Billion-Dollar Core Product

In Week 1, you learned that media rights represent 40-60% of total revenue for major
professional leagues. This week, we examine WHY sports content commands such premium
valuations and HOW rights deals are structured, negotiated, and monetized.

Sports remain the last "appointment viewing" in an era of on-demand entertainment.
Live games can't be spoiled by social media or watched later without losing cultural
currency. This unique characteristic makes sports the most valuable programming for
traditional broadcasters defending against cord-cutting—and the most expensive content
for streaming platforms trying to acquire subscribers.

You'll analyze the Rogers Communications / NHL deal: $5.2 billion over 12 years for
exclusive Canadian rights. Was it worth it? How do you value something this complex?
What did Rogers get wrong—and what did they get right? By week's end, you'll understand
media economics well enough to evaluate mega-deals yourself and recommend platform
strategies for sports properties.
```

## Module 1 Complete - Transition to Module 2

**What You've Accomplished:**
You now understand Week 2's focus: evaluating media and fan monetization strategies. You've seen the four learning objectives that will transform how you analyze billion-dollar media rights deals, and you've been introduced to the three strategic dimensions—rights valuation, linear vs. streaming economics, and fan engagement monetization. You understand that this week builds directly on Week 1's revenue ecosystem foundation, diving deep into the largest revenue stream in professional sports.

**Key Takeaways:**
- **Media rights represent 40-60% of league revenue**—the foundation of modern sports economics
- Sports content is the **last "appointment viewing"** in the streaming era, commanding premium valuations
- Week 2 explores **three strategic dimensions**: rights valuation frameworks, linear vs. DTC economics, and fan engagement monetization
- The **Rogers/NHL $5.2B deal** serves as the case study for evaluating mega-deals
- This week's learning **directly supports Anchor Project Milestone 1** (team formation and property selection)

**Up Next: Module 2 - Executive Perspective**
Before diving into valuation frameworks and strategic models, you'll hear from a senior media executive who has negotiated major sports rights deals. They'll share the real-world challenges, trade-offs, and strategic decisions that bring media economics theory to life.

Ready to learn from someone who's done it? Let's hear the executive perspective.
