Title: Week 2 Learning Objectives ‚óâ

By the end of this week, you will:

**MLO 2.1: Explore how media rights deals are valued and monetized** (Bloom's: Understand)
Explain the frameworks broadcasters and streaming platforms use to price sports content, including audience reach, exclusivity value, and subscription/advertising revenue potential.

**MLO 2.2: Compare linear broadcasting to streaming/DTC models** (Bloom's: Analyze)
Contrast traditional broadcasting economics (advertising-driven, mass audience) with direct-to-consumer streaming models (subscription-driven, targeted engagement) and assess trade-offs for leagues and media companies.

**MLO 2.3: Understand fan engagement monetization strategies** (Bloom's: Understand)
Describe how platforms extend value beyond passive viewing through interactive features, betting integration, social engagement, and multi-platform distribution to maximize advertising, subscription, and sponsorship revenue.

**MLO 2.4: Evaluate the Rogers $5.2B NHL deal and its implications** (Bloom's: Evaluate)
Analyze Rogers Communications' 12-year NHL rights acquisition, assess its strategic outcomes, and determine lessons for future media rights negotiations in the streaming era.

**This week focuses on CLO 2: Evaluating Media & Fan Monetization**
```

### Text Content (week2-intro.docx):
```
Media Rights: The Billion-Dollar Core Product

In Week 1, you learned that media rights represent 40-60% of total revenue for major
professional leagues. This week, we examine WHY sports content commands such premium
valuations and HOW rights deals are structured, negotiated, and monetized.

Sports remain the last "appointment viewing" in an era of on-demand entertainment.
Live games can't be spoiled by social media or watched later without losing cultural
currency. This unique characteristic makes sports the most valuable programming for
traditional broadcasters defending against cord-cutting‚Äîand the most expensive content
for streaming platforms trying to acquire subscribers.

You'll analyze the Rogers Communications / NHL deal: $5.2 billion over 12 years for
exclusive Canadian rights. Was it worth it? How do you value something this complex?
What did Rogers get wrong‚Äîand what did they get right? By week's end, you'll understand
media economics well enough to evaluate mega-deals yourself and recommend platform
strategies for sports properties.
```

### Tiles Content:
Create 3 tiles (1x3 or 2x2 grid with one empty):

**Tile 1 - Title:** "Media Rights Valuation"
**Tile 1 - Description:** "How broadcasters and streamers price sports content. Learn the frameworks behind billion-dollar deals."

**Tile 2 - Title:** "Linear vs. Streaming"
**Tile 2 - Description:** "Traditional broadcasting vs. direct-to-consumer platforms. Economics, trade-offs, and strategic implications."

**Tile 3 - Title:** "Fan Engagement Monetization"
**Tile 3 - Description:** "Beyond passive viewing: how engagement drives advertising, subscription, and sponsorship value."


### Element 4: Learning Outcomes Widget

**Widget Purpose:** Interactive visualization showing how this module's learning outcomes connect to course-level goals

**Uplimit Implementation:**

**Widget File:** `learning-outcomes-module-1.html`

**Embed Code:**
```html
<iframe
  src="../../widgets/learning-outcomes-module-1.html"
  width="100%"
  height="600"

## üéØ FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION

**How Module 1 Supports Your Final Strategic Vision:**

Module 1 established that media rights (40-60% of revenue) are the foundation of modern sports economics. This focus prepares you to analyze media strategy in your Week 5 capstone.

**What You Learned:**
- Media rights are the largest and most strategically complex revenue stream
- Sports content is the last "appointment viewing" commanding premium valuations
- Week 2 dives deep into rights valuation, linear vs. streaming trade-offs, and fan monetization

**How to Apply This to Your Final Project:**

When you craft your 5-year strategic vision in Week 5, Module 1's media focus shapes your revenue projections:

- **Media Rights Strategy Section:** Your capstone must explain how your property will monetize content. Will you pursue traditional linear deals (guaranteed revenue, broad reach) or DTC streaming (potential upside, direct fan relationships)? Module 1 introduced these trade-offs.
- **Revenue Weighting:** If media rights represent 40-60% of sports revenue, your property's media strategy demands the most sophisticated analysis in your vision. Module 1 signals where to invest analytical depth.
- **Market Context:** Use Week 2's frameworks to justify your media approach. Example: "Given declining linear viewership but sports' premium positioning as live content, our property will pursue a hybrid model‚Äîlinear for reach, streaming for engagement."

**Real-World Application:** The Rogers/NHL $5.2B deal you'll analyze this week mirrors the decisions facing YOUR chosen property. Week 2 teaches you how executives evaluate billion-dollar media strategies.

## Module 1 Complete - Transition to Module 2

**What You've Accomplished:**
You now understand Week 2's focus: evaluating media and fan monetization strategies. You've seen the four learning objectives that will transform how you analyze billion-dollar media rights deals, and you've been introduced to the three strategic dimensions‚Äîrights valuation, linear vs. streaming economics, and fan engagement monetization. You understand that this week builds directly on Week 1's revenue ecosystem foundation, diving deep into the largest revenue stream in professional sports.

**Key Takeaways:**
- **Media rights represent 40-60% of league revenue**‚Äîthe foundation of modern sports economics
- Sports content is the **last "appointment viewing"** in the streaming era, commanding premium valuations
- Week 2 explores **three strategic dimensions**: rights valuation frameworks, linear vs. DTC economics, and fan engagement monetization
- The **Rogers/NHL $5.2B deal** serves as the case study for evaluating mega-deals
- This week's learning **directly supports Anchor Project Milestone 1** (team formation and property selection)

**Up Next: Module 2 - Executive Perspective**
Before diving into valuation frameworks and strategic models, you'll hear from a senior media executive who has negotiated major sports rights deals. They'll share the real-world challenges, trade-offs, and strategic decisions that bring media economics theory to life.

Ready to learn from someone who's done it? Let's hear the executive perspective.
