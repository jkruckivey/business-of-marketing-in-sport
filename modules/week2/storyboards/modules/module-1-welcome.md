**WLO 2.2: Compare linear broadcasting to streaming/DTC models** (Bloom's: Analyze)

```

### Text Content (week2-intro.docx):
```
Media Rights: The Billion-Dollar Core Product

In Week 1, you learned that media rights typically represent 40–60% of total revenue for major
professional leagues, varying by sport. This week, we examine WHY sports content commands such premium
valuations and HOW rights deals are structured, negotiated, and monetized.

Sports remain the last "appointment viewing" in an era of on-demand entertainment.
Live games can't be spoiled by social media or watched later without losing cultural
currency. This unique characteristic makes sports the most valuable programming for
traditional broadcasters defending against cord-cutting—and the most expensive content
for streaming platforms trying to acquire subscribers.

You'll analyze the Rogers Communications / NHL deal: $5.2 billion over 12 years for
exclusive Canadian rights. Was it worth it? How do you value something this complex?
What did Rogers get wrong—and what did they get right? By week's end, you'll understand
media economics well enough to evaluate mega-deals yourself and recommend platform
strategies for sports properties.
```

### Element 4: Learning Outcomes Interactive

**Purpose:** Interactive visualization showing how Week 2's learning outcomes connect to course-level goals

**Uplimit Implementation:**

**File:** `learning-outcomes-week.html`

**Embed Code:**
```html
<iframe
  src="../../widgets/learning-outcomes-week.html"
  width="100%"
  height="600"
  style="border: none; border-radius: 8px;"
  title="Week 2 Learning Outcomes"
  aria-label="Interactive tool showing Week 2 learning outcomes and their connection to course goals"
  allowfullscreen
  loading="lazy">
</iframe>
```

**Features:**
- Click any week outcome (WLO 2.1-2.4) to see which course-level outcomes it contributes to
- Interactive highlighting shows connections between week and course goals
- WCAG 2.2 AA compliant with keyboard navigation and screen reader support

### Element 4A: Details - Tool Instructions (Expandable)

**Details Element Title:** `Need help? How to use this tool`

```
This tool shows how Week 2's learning outcomes connect to the overall course goals.

**How to use:**
- Click any Week Learning Outcome (WLO 2.1-2.4) to see which Course Learning Outcome (CLO) it supports
- Connections highlight to show the relationship
- Hover for detailed descriptions of each outcome

**Why it matters:**
- Week 2 primarily supports CLO 2 (Evaluate Media & Fan Monetization)
- But media strategy connects to ALL other weeks (revenue ecosystems, sponsorship, athlete brands, future trends)
- Understanding these connections helps you see the bigger picture
```

**Design Rationale:**
- **Infobox (Callout)** makes learning objectives immediately visible (QM Standard 2)
- **Text** bridges Week 1 concepts and sets Week 2 context (scaffolding, UDL representation)
- **Tiles** preview three core themes for visual organization (UDL engagement)
- Connection to Week 1 revenue streams creates continuity
