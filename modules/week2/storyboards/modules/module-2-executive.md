Title: Executive Session with Al Dak, SVP Revenue, Rogers Sports and Media

Al Dak leads revenue strategy for Rogers Sports and Media, overseeing sales,
sponsorships, and partnerships for Sportsnet, the Toronto Blue Jays, and Rogers'
NHL properties. He spent 20+ years in Canadian sports media, including leadership
roles at CBC (Hockey Night in Canada, Sochi Olympics) and TSN. At Rogers, he's
helped grow Sportsnet from distant third to Canada's #1 sports network, increasing
ad revenue 6x following the $5.2B NHL rights acquisition.

Viewing Guide:
• Watch for: How Rogers justified the $5.2B NHL investment through cable protection,
  advertising leverage, and team ownership strategy
• Note: The evolution from "checking account" to "portfolio management" approach
  for salary cap and inventory pricing
• Consider: How data and analytics transformed from threat to lifeblood in sports
  media operations
• Observe: The 3-channel revenue optimization strategy (long-term deals, dynamic
  pricing, real-time inventory management)

This 45-minute interview provides deep executive insights on media rights valuation,
dynamic inventory pricing, data-driven fan engagement, and Rogers' vertically
integrated sports empire strategy.

Sportsnet, the Toronto Blue Jays, and NHL properties. His career spans 20+ years
in Canadian sports media, starting at media agency work in Windsor before joining
CAN West Global's sales division under David Mintz.

His breakthrough came at CBC, where he led the sales organization during the iconic
Hockey Night in Canada era, traveling coast-to-coast with customers and packaging
the Sochi 2014 Olympics. When Rogers acquired NHL rights in 2013-14, then-president
Keith Pelley recruited Al to help build the commercial strategy that would justify
the historic $5.2 billion investment.

• Grew Sportsnet ad revenue from ~$90M to $540M (6x increase) following NHL rights
  acquisition
• Transformed Sportsnet from distant third to Canada's #1 sports network brand
• Pioneered data-driven revenue management including brand health studies for 90%
  of sponsors
• Negotiated hundreds of millions in annual agency commitments using NHL/Blue Jays
  assets as leverage
• Led revenue strategy during Blue Jays playoff runs and Oilers Stanley Cup Finals,
  managing real-time inventory pricing

Industry Expertise:
• Dynamic pricing and inventory management (game-by-game, supply-demand optimization)
• Data analytics transformation in sports media (from awareness metrics to attribution)
• Vertical integration strategy (broadcast rights + team ownership + distribution)
• Linear-to-streaming transition planning and bundled service models

Current Portfolio (Rogers Sports & Media):
• NHL exclusive Canadian broadcast rights (Sportsnet)
• Toronto Blue Jays (owned by Rogers, broadcast on Sportsnet)
• 75% ownership stake in MLSE (Maple Leafs, Raptors, Toronto FC, Argonauts)
• Sportsnet+ streaming platform
• Rogers Centre naming rights and operations

## Module 2 Complete - Transition to Module 3

**What You've Accomplished:**
You've heard directly from a senior media executive who has negotiated billion-dollar sports rights deals. You now understand how practitioners value sports content, assess platform trade-offs between linear broadcasting and streaming, and navigate the strategic decisions that shape media partnerships. You've gained authentic insights into the challenges facing both rights holders (leagues/teams) and rights buyers (broadcasters/streamers).

**Key Takeaways:**
- **Rogers' $5.2B NHL deal** wasn't just about content - it was a chess move protecting cable distribution, leveraging advertising negotiations, and positioning for team ownership (now 75% of MLSE = largest sports owner in North America)
- **Revenue management evolved from "checking account to portfolio"** - Al's team now prices inventory game-by-game like airlines, managing three channels simultaneously (long-term deals, dynamic pricing, real-time playoff inventory)
- **Data transformed from threat to necessity** - 10 years ago: 1 brand health study for top partner. Today: 90% of sponsors get annual tracking, real-time engagement metrics, creative feedback loops. Without attribution data, sponsorships don't renew.
- **Fan engagement definition shifted** - No longer just buying audience reach. Brands want closed-loop attribution: reach → engagement (interaction) → conversion (purchase) tracked through promo codes, app downloads, geofencing retail visits
- **Linear's future: bundled streaming apps** - Cable penetration 70% in Canada (vs. <50% US) because Rogers made sports the anchor. Future = streaming services bundled like cable packages, not standalone subscriptions
- **Vertical integration = compounding advantages** - Owning NHL rights + Blue Jays team + MLSE stake + Sportsnet platform + Rogers Centre venue = control pricing, cross-promote, capture full value chain (not just licensing fees)
