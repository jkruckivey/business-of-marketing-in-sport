## üéØ FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION

**How Module 2 Supports Your Final Strategic Vision:**

Module 2 delivered practitioner insights from executives who negotiate billion-dollar media deals. This real-world perspective grounds your Week 5 media strategy in operational reality.

**What You Learned:**
- Media deals involve complex trade-offs: reach vs. exclusivity, guaranteed fees vs. revenue share, linear vs. streaming
- Sports content commands premiums because it's live, communal, and can't be delayed
- Executives balance stakeholder pressures (leagues want maximum revenue, broadcasters want profitability, fans want access)

**How to Apply This to Your Final Project:**

When you design your 5-year media strategy in Week 5, reference Module 2's executive frameworks:

- **Platform Selection Rationale:** Justify your media partner choice using executive decision criteria. Example: "Following TSN's model of prioritizing guaranteed fees over revenue share (Week 2 executive interview), our property will pursue traditional broadcast deals to minimize downside risk during our growth phase."
- **Stakeholder Management:** Your vision must satisfy multiple stakeholders. Executives taught you that boards want revenue stability, fans want accessibility, and partners want exclusivity. Show how your media strategy balances these tensions.
- **Realistic Constraints:** Acknowledge market realities. If you're a small-market property, you won't command Rogers' $5.2B valuations. Module 2's executive insights help you set realistic expectations.

**Real-World Application:** The executive you heard from evaluates media opportunities daily. Your Week 5 capstone will undergo similar scrutiny from skeptical stakeholders. Module 2 taught you how practitioners defend media strategies.

## Module 2 Complete - Transition to Module 3

**What You've Accomplished:**
You've heard directly from a senior media executive who has negotiated billion-dollar sports rights deals. You now understand how practitioners value sports content, assess platform trade-offs between linear broadcasting and streaming, and navigate the strategic decisions that shape media partnerships. You've gained authentic insights into the challenges facing both rights holders (leagues/teams) and rights buyers (broadcasters/streamers).

**Key Takeaways:**
- **Real-world media deals** involve complex trade-offs between reach, exclusivity, and profitability
- **Linear vs. streaming economics** differ fundamentally: advertising-driven mass audience vs. subscription-driven targeted engagement
- **Sports content commands premium valuations** because it's the last "appointment viewing" that can't be delayed
- Executive perspective reveals that **theoretical frameworks meet messy reality**‚Äîregulatory constraints, competitive dynamics, and stakeholder pressures shape every deal
- The insights you've gained will directly inform your analysis of the **Rogers/NHL $5.2B deal** coming in Module 4

**Up Next: Module 3 - Interactive Media Rights Framework**
You've heard the executive perspective. Now it's time to build your own understanding through hands-on exploration. Module 3 uses interactive widgets to help you discover media valuation principles through experimentation‚Äînot passive reading. Get ready for active learning!

## üåü MENTAL BREAK #1: Pause & Recharge

**You've completed:** Welcome, learning objectives, and executive insights
**Coming next:** Interactive media rights framework (12-15 minutes)

**Take a moment to:**
- Stand up and stretch for 30 seconds
- Get water or a quick snack
- Look away from your screen (20-20-20 rule: every 20 min, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds)

**Progress:** You're 25% through Week 2 content! The next module uses interactive widgets to help you explore media economics‚Äîit's engaging, but give yourself permission to take breaks between widgets if needed.

*This break is optional but recommended. Return when you're ready to dive into valuation frameworks.*
