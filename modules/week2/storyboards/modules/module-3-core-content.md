### Element 1: Text - Why Media Rights Matter (120 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# Media Rights: The Billion-Dollar Foundation

Recall from Week 1: Professional sport generates revenue through five major streams—media rights (40-60%), ticketing (20-30%), sponsorship (15-25%), merchandising (5-10%), and betting (2-8%). This week, we dive deep into the **largest stream**: media rights.

Media rights—fees paid by broadcasters and streaming platforms to air games—represent the **largest revenue stream** for most professional leagues, typically accounting for **40-60% of total revenue**.

These deals are massive: The NFL's current media rights contracts total **$110 billion over 11 years** ($10B/year). The English Premier League generates over **$5 billion per year** from domestic and international broadcast rights.

**Why sports command premium value:**
- Live games create **"appointment viewing"** (can't watch later without spoilers)
- Sports deliver **simultaneous audiences** (rare in 2024 on-demand world)
- Premium advertising rates: Sports CPM **$50-70** vs. scripted TV **$15-25**

This module explores HOW broadcasters value these rights deals.

### Element 5: Widget 1 - Audience Size Calculator

### ⚙ Interactive Activity: Audience Size Calculator

**Practice: WLO 2.1 (Explore media rights valuation)**

You've learned that media rights represent 40-60% of league revenue—but what actually determines how much a league can charge for its rights? The answer starts with audience size and demographics.

In this interactive activity, you'll calculate the estimated media rights value for different leagues (NFL, NHL, NBA, MLS, Premier League, or create your own custom league) by manipulating audience size, game count, demographic premiums, and advertising rates. Watch how changing just one variable—like increasing coveted demo percentage from 30% to 50%—can add hundreds of millions to annual rights value.

**What you'll discover:**

- Why total audience reach (viewers × games) matters more than per-game ratings
- How the "coveted demo" (18-49 with $75K+ income) creates valuation premiums
- Why the NFL commands $10B annually while MLS gets $250M despite similar game counts
- That rights valuation is formula-driven, not arbitrary—you can calculate it yourself

**Time commitment:** 4-5 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** WLO 2.1 (Explore media rights valuation frameworks)

---

**🎮 Widget Purpose:** Demonstrate how audience size and demographics drive rights valuations using real league examples.

**Widget Status:** ⭕ Phase 3 widget - NEEDS TO BE BUILT (4-5 hours estimated)

**How It Works:**
1. Select league: NFL, NHL, NBA, MLS, Premier League, or Custom
2. Input fields auto-populate with real data (or allow custom):
   - Average viewership per game (millions)
   - Number of games per season
   - Coveted demo % (18-49 with $75K+ income)
   - CPM (cost per thousand viewers) advertising rate
3. Real-time calculations display:
   - Total audience reach (viewers × games)
   - Premium audience value (demo multiplier)
   - Advertising revenue potential
   - Estimated annual rights value ($M)
   - Per-game rights value
   - Comparison bar chart vs. NFL baseline

**Real Examples:**
- **NFL:** 17M avg viewers, 272 games → **$10B/year**
- **NHL:** 1.5M avg viewers, 1,271 games → **$2B/year**
- **MLS:** 300K avg viewers, 408 games → **$250M/year**

**Learning Objectives:**
- WLO 2.1: Understand audience size as primary valuation driver
- Recognize "total eyeballs" matters more than per-game ratings
- Calculate simple rights valuations using audience metrics

**Technical Specifications:**
```javascript
function calculateRightsValue(avgViewers, numGames, covetedDemoPercent, cpm) {
  const totalReach = avgViewers * numGames;
  const premiumMultiplier = 1 + (covetedDemoPercent / 100);
  const adRevenuePotential = (totalReach * cpm) / 1000;
  const estimatedRightsValue = adRevenuePotential * premiumMultiplier * 0.4;
  return { totalReach, premiumMultiplier, adRevenuePotential, estimatedRightsValue };
}
```

**Accessibility:**

### Element 6: Text - Exclusivity & Competition Dynamics (150 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# Exclusivity Creates Bidding Wars

**Exclusive rights** cost 2-3x more than non-exclusive packages—but they're worth it for strategic reasons.

## Why Exclusivity Matters

**For Broadcasters:**
- Exclusive content can't be found elsewhere (drives subscriptions and viewership)
- Differentiation in crowded streaming market (e.g., Apple TV+ with MLS, Amazon with NFL Thursday)
- Bundling power: "Watch YOUR team only on our platform"

**For Leagues:**
- Multiple bidders drive prices up exponentially
- Competition between traditional networks, streamers (Netflix, Apple, Amazon), and tech giants (Google, Meta)
- Example: NFL split packages across CBS, FOX, NBC, ESPN, Amazon—maximized total value

## The Bidding War Dynamic

When Amazon entered NFL rights bidding (2021), traditional networks had to raise bids to compete. Result: NFL rights increased 75% from previous deal despite stable ratings.

**Next: Experience exclusivity bidding through simulation.**
```

### Element 7: Widget 2 - Exclusivity Bidding Simulator

### ⚙ Interactive Activity: Exclusivity Bidding Simulator

**Practice: WLO 2.1 (Explore media rights valuation and deal structures)**

You've calculated what drives rights valuation—now experience the strategic decision leagues face when multiple bidders compete for exclusive rights.

In this simulation, you're the NHL commissioner in 2025 facing three bidders for Canadian national rights: Rogers offers $450M/year (cautious after losing money), DAZN offers $550M/year (aggressive growth), and Apple TV+ offers $700M/year (strategic play). Do you accept Apple's exclusive $700M? Or split rights across all three for $1.15B total revenue but lose exclusivity? There's no obviously "right" answer—just strategic trade-offs.

**What you'll discover:**

- Why a single bidder paying $700M can be worth LESS than multiple bidders paying $1.15B combined
- How exclusivity creates bidding premiums (Apple pays more to be the ONLY platform)
- The hidden costs of split rights packages (coordination complexity, partner conflicts)
- Why leagues sometimes choose lower bids for strategic reasons (accessibility, partner reliability)

**Time commitment:** 5-6 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** WLO 2.1 (Explore media rights valuation and competitive dynamics)

---

**🎮 Widget Purpose:** Let students experience competitive bidding dynamics and understand why exclusive rights command premium prices.

**Widget Status:** ⭕ Phase 2 widget - NEEDS TO BE BUILT (5-6 hours estimated)

**How It Works:**
1. **Scenario:** You are NHL commissioner in 2025. Three bidders want Canadian national rights:
   - **Rogers (incumbent):** $450M/year (cautious, lost money on 2014 deal)
   - **DAZN (streaming disruptor):** $550M/year (aggressive growth strategy)
   - **Apple TV+ (tech giant):** $700M/year (strategic not financial decision)

2. **Student Decision:** Accept Apple's $700M exclusive OR Split rights package:
   - Rogers $450M regional + DAZN $400M national + Apple $300M streaming = $1.15B total (non-exclusive)

3. **Outcomes Display:**
   - **Exclusive Apple ($700M/year):** Pros: Predictable revenue, single partner. Cons: Canadian fans need subscription, lower total revenue
   - **Split Package ($1.15B/year):** Pros: 64% higher revenue, better accessibility. Cons: Complex coordination, potential conflicts

**Learning Objectives:**
- WLO 2.1: Understand exclusivity premium
- Experience competitive bidding dynamics
- Recognize trade-offs: Highest bidder vs. accessibility vs. total revenue

**Technical Specifications:**
```javascript
const bidders = [
  { name: "Rogers", bid: 450, rationale: "Risk-averse. Prefers regional only." },
  { name: "DAZN", bid: 550, rationale: "Aggressive growth. Needs anchor content." },
  { name: "Apple TV+", bid: 700, rationale: "Strategic acquisition. Global ambitions." }
];

function calculatePackageValue(exclusiveOption, splitOptions) {
  return exclusiveOption ?
    { annual: exclusiveOption.bid, type: "Exclusive" } :
    { annual: splitOptions.reduce((sum, o) => sum + o.bid, 0), type: "Split" };
}
```

**Accessibility:**
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter to reveal/select)
- ✅ ARIA live regions for bid reveals
- ✅ Screen reader compatible bid cards
- ✅ High contrast mode
- ✅ Focus indicators on interactive cards

**Implementation Notes:** Card-based interface with reveal animation, comparison logic, strategic insights panel. Preset scenarios for NHL, NFL, Premier League.

### Element 8: Infobox (Note) - Key Insight: Appointment Viewing

```
Title: ▶ Key Insight: "Appointment Viewing" in an On-Demand World

Sports are the last true appointment viewing. You can't watch a game "later" without risking spoilers from social media, friends, or news alerts. This creates:

• Predictable, simultaneous audience (rare in 2024)
• Premium advertising rates (live = engaged = valuable)
• Subscription retention power (can't cancel during season)
• Cultural currency ("Did you see that play?")

This unique characteristic explains why sports rights command prices that seem economically irrational—until you understand their strategic defensive value for traditional broadcasters and offensive value for streaming disruptors.
```

**Design Note:** Yellow Infobox (Note variant). Reinforces WHY bidders compete aggressively.

### Element 9: Text - Linear TV vs. Streaming Intro (120 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# Two Business Models, Different Economics

Traditional linear broadcasting and direct-to-consumer streaming have **fundamentally different economics**—which explains why sports rights deals are structured differently for each platform.

## Linear TV (Traditional Broadcasting)
- **Revenue:** Advertising (80%) + carriage fees from cable/satellite providers (20%)
- **Goal:** Maximize viewership to sell ads at premium rates
- **Timeline:** Immediate profitability expected (if deal priced correctly)
- **Risk:** Cord-cutting and audience fragmentation

## Streaming/DTC (Direct-to-Consumer)
- **Revenue:** Subscriptions (90%) + advertising tier (10%)
- **Goal:** Acquire and retain subscribers (customer lifetime value thinking)
- **Timeline:** 3-5 year payback period (invest in growth first)
- **Risk:** Subscriber churn and price sensitivity

**Next: Compare models side-by-side and explore trade-offs.**
```

### Element 10: Table - Platform Economics Comparison

| **Model** | **Revenue Sources** | **Cost Structure** | **Key Risks** | **Profitability Timeline** | **Sports Strategy** |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **Linear TV** | Ad revenue (80%)<br>Carriage fees (20%) | Rights fees<br>Production costs | Cord-cutting<br>Audience fragmentation | Immediate (if priced right) | Defend subscribers<br>Must-have to prevent cancellation |
| **Streaming/DTC** | Subscriptions (90%)<br>Advertising tier (10%) | Rights fees<br>Technology infrastructure<br>Customer acquisition costs | Subscriber churn<br>Price sensitivity<br>Content overload | 3-5 years (customer LTV model) | Acquire new users<br>Reduce churn with exclusive sports |

**Table Note:** "Economics vary significantly by property and market. These represent typical patterns for major sports rights deals in 2024."

### Element 11: Widget 3 - Platform Economics Visualizer

### ⚙ Interactive Activity: Platform Economics Visualizer

**Practice: WLO 2.2 (Compare linear broadcasting to streaming/DTC models)**

You've learned that linear TV and streaming platforms operate on fundamentally different economics. But what does that actually mean for profitability? Why do streaming platforms lose money for years while traditional broadcasters either profit immediately or never break even?

In this interactive activity, you'll toggle between Linear TV and Streaming/DTC models, adjusting key variables (rights costs, ad rates, subscription price, churn rate, customer acquisition costs) and watching a 10-year projection chart show when—or if—each platform becomes profitable. Try recreating Rogers' NHL deal (linear TV, never profitable, ~$1.5B loss) or DAZN Canada (streaming, profitable by Year 4).

**What you'll discover:**

- Why streaming platforms lose money for 3-5 years by design (customer lifetime value thinking)
- How cord-cutting destroys linear TV profitability even if rights deals seem "fair" at signing
- Why tech giants like Apple can "overpay" for rights—they're buying subscribers, not immediate profit
- The mathematics behind Rogers' $1.5B loss on the NHL deal (subscriber decline killed them)

**Time commitment:** 6-7 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** WLO 2.2 (Compare linear vs. streaming economics and profitability models)

---

**🎮 Widget Purpose:** Let students manipulate platform economics variables and see how profitability timelines differ between linear TV and streaming models.

**Widget Status:** ⭕ Phase 2 widget - NEEDS TO BE BUILT (6-7 hours estimated)

**How It Works:**
1. Toggle between **Linear TV** and **Streaming/DTC**
2. Adjust variables with sliders:
   - **Linear TV:** Rights cost, ad CPM, carriage fee, starting subscribers, annual decline %
   - **Streaming:** Rights cost, subscription price, starting subs, monthly growth %, churn rate, CAC
3. View 10-year projection:
   - Line chart: Annual revenue vs. costs
   - Break-even year (or "Never")
   - Cumulative profit/loss
   - Strategic insights (dynamic based on inputs)

**Real-World Presets:**
- **Rogers NHL (Linear):** $433M rights, 11.2M → 8.1M subs, NEVER profitable (loss ~$1.5B over 10 years)
- **DAZN Canada (Streaming):** $50M rights, 50K → 500K subs, profitable Year 4 (+$200M by Year 10)
- **Apple TV+ MLS (Streaming):** $250M rights, 0 → 2M subs, profitable Year 5 IF targets met

**Learning Objectives:**
- WLO 2.2: Compare linear vs. streaming profitability through manipulation
- Understand why streaming "loses money for years"
- Recognize cord-cutting impact on linear TV
- Appreciate why tech giants can "overpay" (LTV thinking)

**Technical Specifications:**
```javascript
function calculateLinearTV(rightsCost, adCPM, carriageFee, startingSubs, annualDecline, years = 10) {
  let results = [];
  let subscribers = startingSubs;
  for (let year = 1; year <= years; year++) {
    subscribers *= (1 - annualDecline);
    const avgViewership = subscribers * 0.15;
    const adRevenue = avgViewership * 50 * adCPM / 1000;
    const carriageRevenue = subscribers * carriageFee * 12;
    const totalRevenue = adRevenue + carriageRevenue;
    const costs = rightsCost + (avgViewership * 2);
    results.push({ year, revenue: totalRevenue, costs, profit: totalRevenue - costs });
  }
  return results;
}

function calculateStreaming(rightsCost, subPrice, startingSubs, monthlyGrowth, churnRate, CAC, years = 10) {
  let results = [];
  let subscribers = startingSubs;
  for (let year = 1; year <= years; year++) {
    for (let month = 1; month <= 12; month++) {
      subscribers = subscribers + (subscribers * monthlyGrowth) - (subscribers * churnRate);
    }
    const revenue = subscribers * subPrice * 12;
    const costs = rightsCost + (startingSubs * CAC);
    results.push({ year, revenue, costs, profit: revenue - costs });
  }
  return results;
}

### Element 11: Text - Fan Engagement Monetization (150 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# Beyond Passive Viewing: Engagement as Revenue Driver

Modern sports monetization extends beyond passive viewing. **Active fan engagement** creates multiple revenue streams and increases customer lifetime value.

## The Engagement Value Chain

**Passive Viewer** (Low Value):
- Watches games occasionally
- Generates: Advertising impressions, basic viewership metrics
- Value: $5-15/year

**Engaged Fan** (Medium Value):
- Watches regularly + uses team app + follows on social media
- Generates: Premium ad rates, app sponsorship opportunities, first-party data
- Value: $50-100/year

**Super-Fan** (High Value):
- Watches everything + fantasy sports + betting + exclusive content subscriptions
- Generates: Premium subscriptions, betting partnerships, exclusive content monetization
- Value: $300-500+/year

## Why Engagement Matters for Rights Deals

Platforms that drive engagement (interactive features, fantasy integration, betting) justify higher rights costs because they extract more value per viewer.

**Next: Build your own engagement value chain.**
```

---

### Element 12: Widget 4 - Engagement Value Chain Builder

### ⚙ Interactive Activity: Engagement Value Chain Builder

**Practice: WLO 2.3 (Understand fan engagement monetization strategies)**

You've explored how platforms make money from media rights. But passive viewing generates only $5-15 per fan per year. The real value comes from ENGAGEMENT—converting passive viewers into active participants who bet, play fantasy, subscribe to exclusive content, and interact with team apps.

In this interactive activity, you'll construct an engagement strategy by selecting tactics (mobile app, fantasy integration, betting partnerships, exclusive content, social media, gamification) and watching your fan value transform. Start with 1M passive fans worth $10M/year—then see how adding betting partnerships alone can increase value to $13M+ despite costing nothing (revenue share model). Build the optimal engagement mix.

**What you'll discover:**

- Why a fan who bets is worth 6-10x more than a passive viewer ($30 vs. $5 per year)
- How engagement tactics have vastly different cost/benefit profiles (betting = $0 cost, high value; exclusive content = $3M cost, high value)
- Why platforms with engagement capabilities (ESPN Bet, DraftKings partnerships) can justify paying more for rights
- The mathematics of converting 10% of your audience to "super-fans" worth $300-500 each

**Time commitment:** 5-6 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** WLO 2.3 (Understand fan engagement monetization beyond passive viewing)

---

**🎮 Widget Purpose:** Let students construct an engagement strategy and see how different tactics increase fan value and justify higher rights costs.

**Widget Status:** ⭕ Phase 3 widget - NEEDS TO BE BUILT (5-6 hours estimated)

**How It Works:**
1. Choose sport type (NHL, NBA, MLS, NFL, EPL)
2. Set baseline: 1M fans, $10/year passive value
3. Select engagement tactics (checkboxes with costs/benefits):
   - **Mobile App:** +$2M cost → 30% adopt → +$5/fan value
   - **Fantasy Integration:** +$500K cost → 15% participate → +$15/fan value
   - **Betting Partnerships:** $0 cost (revenue share) → 10% engage → +$30/fan value
   - **Exclusive Content:** +$3M cost → 20% subscribe → +$25/fan value
   - **Social Media Strategy:** +$1M cost → 50% follow → +$8/fan value
   - **Gamification:** +$1.5M cost → 25% participate → +$12/fan value
4. View results:
   - Engagement funnel visualization (passive → engaged → super-fan)
   - Total fan value: $XX.XM/year
   - ROI: (Total value - costs) / costs
   - Rights affordability: "With engagement, you can afford $XXM/year in rights"

**Real Examples:**
- **NBA + DraftKings:** Fan value $12 → $45/year (fantasy + betting)
- **Premier League + Social:** International fan value $5 → $18/year

**Learning Objectives:**
- WLO 2.3: Understand how engagement extends monetization beyond passive viewing

## Module 3 Complete - Transition to Module 4

**What You've Accomplished:**
You've explored media rights economics through hands-on discovery using 4 interactive widgets. You understand how leagues calculate media rights value, how streaming platform economics differ from traditional broadcasting, how rights holders compare linear vs. DTC strategies, and why fan engagement drives monetization across multiple channels. You've actively manipulated variables, experimented with scenarios, and discovered principles through exploration—not passive reading.

**Key Takeaways:**
- **Media rights valuation** depends on audience size, demographics, exclusivity, and platform reach—not just viewership numbers
- **Streaming economics** fundamentally differ from linear broadcasting: subscription-driven, targeted engagement vs. advertising-driven, mass reach
- **Rights holders face strategic trade-offs**: guaranteed fees from traditional broadcasters vs. potential upside from DTC platforms
- **Fan engagement extends monetization** beyond passive viewing through betting integration, interactive features, and multi-platform distribution
- The 4 widgets you used revealed that **no single "right" strategy exists**—success depends on league maturity, market position, and risk tolerance

**Up Next: Module 4 - Streaming Wars Simulation**
You've learned the frameworks. Now it's time to apply them strategically. In Module 4, you'll simulate platform strategy decisions as a streaming executive building a sports content empire.

## 🌟 MENTAL BREAK #2: Reset Before Simulation

**You've completed:** Media rights valuation framework with 4 interactive widgets
**Coming next:** Streaming Wars simulation (30-45 minutes)

**Take a moment to:**
- Walk around for 2-3 minutes (get your blood flowing)
- Grab a drink or snack if needed
- Close your eyes and take 3 deep breaths

**Progress:** You're 50% through Week 2 content! You've learned the frameworks—now you'll apply them in a strategic simulation. The next module is a game-like experience where you'll make real platform decisions.

*Consider this your halftime break. The simulation ahead is engaging but requires focus. Return refreshed and ready to build your streaming empire!*
