# Interactive Simulation: Streaming Wars Strategy

You've learned the frameworks for valuing media rights and comparing linear vs. streaming economics (Module 3). Now you'll **experience these trade-offs** firsthand by building and managing a Canadian sports streaming platform from scratch.

## Your Challenge

As VP of Content Strategy, you'll make the same high-stakes decisions that Rogers, DAZN, and TSN executives face:

1. **Acquire Sports Rights** - Which leagues and teams should you bid on? Hockey is expensive but popular. Soccer has growth potential but lower current demand. Emerging sports are cheap but risky.

2. **Set Pricing Strategy** - Price too high ($29.99/month) and subscribers won't sign up. Price too low ($9.99/month) and you'll never cover content costs. What's the sweet spot?

3. **Manage Growth vs. Profitability** - Do you invest heavily in content to attract subscribers (lose money short-term) or grow slowly with cheaper content (miss market window)?

4. **Respond to Market Events** - Competitors will launch. Recessions will hit. Star players will get traded. How will you adapt?

## What You'll Practice

- **MLO 2.2:** Compare linear broadcasting economics to streaming/DTC models through real-time financial feedback
- **MLO 2.1:** Make media rights valuation decisions under budget constraints
- **MLO 2.3:** Balance fan engagement monetization with content investment

## Strategic Considerations

Before you start, consider these insights from Module 3:

- **Content Costs are Fixed:** Once you acquire rights, you pay regardless of subscribers. This creates massive downside risk if growth disappoints.
- **Subscriber Acquisition Takes Time:** Rogers projected 1M subscribers by Year 5. They achieved 300K. Growth is slower than executives predict.
- **Churn is Brutal:** If 10% of subscribers cancel each month (industry average), you need constant new sign-ups just to maintain your base.
- **Break-Even Takes 3-5 Years:** Streaming platforms lose money initially. Can you (and your board) handle years of red ink?

**Key Strategic Principle:** The economics that work for Netflix (mass-market content, global scale) don't automatically work for sports streaming (expensive niche content, regional restrictions).

## How the Simulation Works

**Phase 1: Rights Acquisition (Year 1)**
- You have a $50M annual budget for rights
- Choose from: NHL ($40M), NBA ($25M), MLS ($15M), CPL ($5M)
- Each property delivers different subscriber appeal and retention

**Phase 2: Pricing & Launch**
- Set monthly subscription price ($9.99 - $29.99)
- Launch to market and watch subscribers sign up (or not)
- Monitor churn rate and monthly recurring revenue (MRR)

**Phase 3: Quarterly Decisions (Years 2-5)**
- **Renewal decisions:** Rights expire annually - renew or walk away?
- **Pricing adjustments:** Lower price to grow faster or raise price to improve margins?
- **Engagement investments:** Spend $5M on features (mobile app, 4K, DVR) to reduce churn?
- **Market events:** Respond to competitor launches, recessions, playoff runs

**Phase 4: Results Dashboard**
- See your 5-year profitability curve
- Compare your strategy to Rogers, DAZN, and TSN benchmarks
- Export your results to reference in Module 5 case analysis

## After the Simulation

Once you complete the simulation, you'll:
1. Reflect on strategic questions (Element 5)
2. Share your strategy in Discussion Forum #2
3. Use your insights to analyze Rogers' real $5.2B NHL deal (Module 5)

**Ready?** Launch the Streaming Wars Strategy simulation below and start building your platform. Remember: there's no single "correct" strategy - your goal is to make defensible choices and learn from the outcomes.

## Element 5: Reflection Prompt

### Text Content (Reflection Prompt):
```
After completing the Streaming Wars Strategy simulation:

Strategic Reflection Questions:
• What was your path to profitability? How many years did it take?
• Which sports properties delivered the best ROI? Which were too expensive?
• How did you balance content costs vs. subscriber acquisition?
• What surprised you about the economics of streaming vs. expectations?

This simulation prepares you to analyze the Rogers/NHL deal in Module 5. Rogers
essentially made these same strategic decisions—but with $5.2 billion at stake.
Consider: Would you have made the Rogers deal using the insights from this simulation?
```

## Element 7: Strategic Considerations (Hints)

### Details Content:
```
Title: ◆ Strategic Considerations (Open if you're stuck)

Not sure how to approach this simulation? Here are some frameworks:

**Customer Lifetime Value (LTV):**
How long will subscribers stay? If average subscriber stays 18 months at $19.99/month,
their LTV is ~$360. How much can you spend to acquire them? How much on content to
retain them?

**Content Portfolio Strategy:**
• Anchor Properties: High-cost, broad appeal (e.g., NHL, NBA) - drive subscriptions
• Niche Properties: Lower-cost, targeted appeal (e.g., esports, rugby) - reduce churn
• Emerging Properties: Speculative bets (e.g., women's sports, new leagues) - differentiation

**The Streaming Profitability Paradox:**
Growth requires spending on content AND customer acquisition. Profitability requires
reducing both. Most streaming services lose money for 3-5 years building scale.

**Pricing Strategy:**
• Too low: Can't cover content costs, perceived as low-quality
• Too high: Small addressable market, high churn risk
• Sweet spot: Premium enough to signal quality, accessible enough for mass market

**Rights Negotiation:**
• Exclusive rights cost 2-3x more than non-exclusive
• Multi-year deals lock in costs but reduce flexibility
• Regional rights (Canada-only) cheaper than global but smaller audience

**Engagement Investments:**
Beyond just streaming games, consider: interactive features, fantasy integration,
social viewing, original content (documentaries, shoulder programming).
These reduce churn but add costs.

**Key Question:**
What is your differentiation? Why do subscribers choose YOU over competitors?
```

**Design Rationale:**
- **iFrame widget** provides experiential learning of complex economics (UDL engagement, Application level)
- **Infobox** clearly frames task and connects to MLOs (QM clarity)
- **Reflection prompt** encourages metacognition and case study preparation (transfer)
- **AI Chat** offers adaptive support for struggling students (UDL scaffolding)
- **Details** provides strategic frameworks without prescribing answers (progressive disclosure)
- Multiple paths to profitability - no single "right" strategy (UDL choice)
- Directly prepares students to evaluate Rogers deal critically (MLO 2.4)

## Element 9: Mental Break - Prepare for Case Analysis

## 🌟 MENTAL BREAK #3: Prepare for Case Analysis

**You've completed:** Framework learning + strategic simulation
**Coming next:** Rogers $5.2B NHL case study (23-25 minutes)

**Take a moment to:**
- Stand and do 5 shoulder rolls backward, 5 forward
- Get fresh water or coffee
- Step outside for 60 seconds if possible (fresh air resets focus)

**Progress:** You're 70% through Week 2 content! The simulation showed you platform strategy in action. Now you'll analyze a real mega-deal to see where theory meets reality. This case has 4 interactive data widgets—it's fascinating but dense.

*This is your most important break. The case study requires critical thinking and synthesis. Take 3-5 minutes to truly reset before diving into the Rogers deal.*

## Element 10: Final Project Connection

## 🎯 FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION

**How Module 4 Supports Your Final Strategic Vision:**

Module 4's Streaming Wars simulation gave you hands-on experience building a direct-to-consumer media strategy. This is critical for your Week 5 capstone if your property pursues DTC.

**What You Learned:**
- Streaming economics require balancing content acquisition costs, customer acquisition, pricing, and churn
- Platform profitability takes 3-5 years due to upfront investment in content and marketing
- Strategic trade-offs: exclusive rights (2-3× cost) vs. non-exclusive, broad content portfolio vs. niche focus

**How to Apply This to Your Final Project:**

When you craft your 5-year media strategy in Week 5, Module 4's simulation provides your DTC analysis framework:

- **Build vs. License Decision:** If your property considers launching its own streaming service, use Module 4's economics to model profitability timelines. Example: "Following Streaming Wars simulation learnings, our DTC platform requires $50M initial investment with break-even projected in Year 4."
- **Content Strategy:** Module 4 taught portfolio balance—anchor properties (broad appeal, high cost) + niche content (retention, lower cost). Apply this to your property's content mix.
- **Customer Economics:** Reference Module 4's LTV calculations to justify pricing. Show subscriber lifetime value exceeds acquisition cost.

**Real-World Application:** Major leagues (NBA, NFL, NHL) are evaluating DTC strategies. Module 4's simulation mirrors the financial models they build to decide whether to launch proprietary streaming services.

## Element 11: Module 4 Complete - Transition to Module 5

**🎯 Module 4 Complete!** You've simulated the strategic decisions that media companies face when building streaming platforms. You experienced firsthand the tension between content costs, pricing, and subscriber growth—the same calculus that shaped Rogers' $5.2 billion NHL deal.

**Key Insights from Your Simulation:**
- Streaming profitability requires 3-5 year horizons (not immediate ROI like linear TV)
- Content portfolio balance matters (anchor properties + niche content for retention)
- Pricing psychology affects both acquisition and churn

**Strategic Competency Achieved:**
You can now evaluate real-world media rights deals through the lens of platform economics. When you read about Netflix paying $500M for WWE rights or Apple TV+ securing MLS for $250M/year, you understand the LTV calculations, subscriber acquisition costs, and profitability timelines driving those decisions.

**Next: Module 5 - Rogers NHL Case Study (23-25 minutes)**

Now you'll analyze Rogers Communications' actual $5.2B, 12-year NHL deal—the largest media rights agreement in Canadian history. Armed with Module 4's simulation experience, you'll critically evaluate their decisions using 4 interactive data widgets:

- Was Rogers' exclusive NHL bet brilliant long-term thinking or strategic overreach?
- How did changing consumer behavior (cord-cutting) impact their projections?
- What would YOU have done differently with $5.2B at stake?

The case has real financial data, competitive analysis tools, and viewership trend visualizers. This is where theory meets reality.
