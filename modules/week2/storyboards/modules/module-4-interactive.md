## Element 1: Connecting Introduction

# Build Your Streaming Platform: Strategy in Action

You've just explored media rights valuation, exclusivity dynamics, and platform economics through frameworks and knowledge checks in Media Rights Frameworks. Now you'll **apply these concepts** in a strategic simulation where you build a sports streaming platform from scratch.

In this module, you'll step into the role of VP of Content Strategy for a Canadian streaming platform, making the same high-stakes decisions that Rogers, DAZN, and TSN faced when building their streaming services. This hands-on experience prepares you to critically analyze the Rogers $5.2B NHL deal in The Rogers Challenge.

**Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes (can be completed in multiple sessions)

## Element 2: Activity Instructions

### Infobox Content:
```
Title: ■ Activity: Streaming Wars Strategy Simulation

You are the VP of Content Strategy for a new Canadian streaming platform with one goal: build a profitable sports streaming service by acquiring rights, setting pricing, and managing subscriber growth versus content costs. You'll apply media rights valuation (WLO 2.1), compare linear and streaming economics (WLO 2.2), and balance content investment with fan engagement tactics (WLO 2.3). Choose sports properties to bid on, set subscription pricing, make quarterly decisions about rights renewal and pricing changes, then achieve profitability within 5 years while managing churn. Time: 30-45 minutes, completable in multiple sessions.

# Practice: Build Your Streaming Platform

You've learned the frameworks for valuing media rights and comparing linear vs. streaming economics. Now you'll **experience these trade-offs** firsthand by building a Canadian sports streaming platform from scratch.

## Your Challenge

You're the VP of Content Strategy for a new Canadian streaming platform. Your ownership group has one question: "Can we build a profitable sports streaming service?" You'll make the same high-stakes decisions that Rogers, DAZN, and TSN executives face—which rights to acquire, how to price subscriptions, and how to balance content costs against subscriber growth.

## What You'll Practice

- Bidding on sports rights with limited budget (hockey vs. soccer vs. emerging sports)
- Setting subscription pricing to balance growth against revenue per user
- Managing subscriber churn through engagement features
- Navigating the 3-5 year break-even timeline that defines streaming economics
- Understanding why content costs create massive downside risk

## How the Simulator Works

1. **Choose Your Rights Portfolio:** Allocate budget across hockey ($40M/year), basketball ($25M/year), soccer ($15M/year), and emerging sports ($5M/year). Exclusive rights cost 2-3× non-exclusive.
2. **Set Subscription Price:** Choose $9.99-$29.99/month. Lower prices drive growth; higher prices improve unit economics.
3. **Make Quarterly Decisions:** Each quarter, decide whether to renew rights, adjust pricing, or invest in engagement features (fantasy, betting integration, social features).
4. **Track Key Metrics:** Subscriber count, monthly churn rate, monthly recurring revenue (MRR), content costs, and profitability timeline.
5. **Navigate Random Events:** Competitor launches, recession hits, star player trades, playoff runs—respond strategically.

## Strategic Considerations

- **Content costs are fixed, subscribers are variable:** You pay $40M/year for hockey rights whether you have 100K or 1M subscribers. High subscriber count = profitable. Low subscriber count = catastrophic losses.
- **Churn is the silent killer:** 10% monthly churn means you lose your entire subscriber base every 10 months. You must constantly acquire new subscribers just to stay flat.
- **Exclusive vs. non-exclusive:** Exclusive NHL rights cost 2-3× more but prevent competitors from offering the same content. Non-exclusive saves money but commoditizes your platform.
- **The 3-5 year timeline:** Streaming platforms typically lose money for years before reaching profitability. Can you survive long enough?

## After the Simulator

Export your final results—subscriber count, profitability timeline, and key decisions. You'll reference this experience when analyzing Rogers' $5.2B NHL deal in The Rogers Challenge (Module 5).

## Element 3: Streaming Wars Strategy Tool

### ⚙ Interactive Activity: Streaming Wars Strategy

**Practice: WLO 2.2 (Compare linear broadcasting to streaming economics) + WLO 2.1 (Explore media rights valuation) + WLO 2.3 (Assess fan engagement monetization)**

You've learned the frameworks for valuing media rights and comparing linear vs. streaming economics in Media Rights Frameworks. Now you'll **experience these trade-offs** firsthand by building and managing a Canadian sports streaming platform from scratch.

As VP of Content Strategy, you'll make the same high-stakes decisions that Rogers, DAZN, and TSN executives face: Which leagues should you bid on? Hockey is expensive but popular ($40M/year). Soccer has growth potential but lower current demand ($15M/year). Emerging sports are cheap but risky ($5M/year). Price too high ($29.99/month) and subscribers won't sign up. Price too low ($9.99/month) and you'll never cover content costs. Invest heavily in content to attract subscribers or grow slowly and miss the market window? Streaming platforms typically lose money for 3-5 years—can you achieve profitability?

**What you'll discover:**

- Why content costs create massive downside risk (you pay regardless of subscriber count)
- How subscriber churn forces constant growth to maintain revenue (10% monthly cancellation is industry average)
- The 3-5 year break-even timeline for streaming (very different from linear TV's immediate ROI)
- Strategic trade-offs between exclusive rights (2-3× cost) versus non-exclusive broader portfolios
- How dynamic pricing (recall Al Dark's "checking account to portfolio management" insight from Inside the Media Business) applies to streaming subscriptions

**Connecting to the Fan Engagement Framework:**
Remember the fan engagement value chain from Media Rights Frameworks (passive viewer → engaged fan → super-fan)? In this simulation, you'll invest in engagement tactics that move subscribers up that chain—betting integration, fantasy features, social communities—to reduce churn and increase lifetime value.

**Time commitment:** 30-45 minutes (can be completed in multiple sessions)
**Learning outcomes practiced:** WLO 2.2 (Compare linear vs. streaming economics), WLO 2.1 (Media rights valuation with budget constraints), WLO 2.3 (Balance content investment with fan engagement)

---

**🎮 Tool Purpose:** Simulate streaming platform strategy decisions to understand trade-offs between content costs, pricing, and subscriber growth through hands-on experience.

**Status:** ✅ Phase 2 tool - BUILT AND READY

**How It Works:**

**Inputs:**
- Rights acquisition budget ($0-$100M/year across hockey, basketball, soccer, emerging sports)
- Subscription pricing ($9.99 - $29.99/month)
- Quarterly decisions: Renew rights? Adjust pricing? Invest in engagement features?

**Outputs:**
- Subscriber count (0-1M potential)
- Monthly churn rate (5%-20%)
- Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
- Total content costs
- Profitability timeline (years to break even)

**Scenarios:**
- Competitor launches (pricing pressure)
- Recession hits (churn increases)
- Star player trade (subscriber spike)
- Playoff runs (retention boost)

**Real Examples:**
- Rogers Sportsnet NOW ($27.99/month, NHL exclusive)
- DAZN Canada ($24.99/month, multi-sport)
- TSN Direct ($19.99/month, TSN content)

## Element 4: Reflection Prompt

### Text Content (Reflection Prompt):
```
After completing the Streaming Wars Strategy simulation:

Strategic Reflection Questions:
• What was your path to profitability? How many years did it take?
• Which sports properties delivered the best ROI? Which were too expensive?
• How did you balance content costs vs. subscriber acquisition?
• What surprised you about the economics of streaming vs. expectations?

This simulation prepares you to analyze the Rogers/NHL deal in The Rogers Challenge. Rogers
essentially made these same strategic decisions—but with $5.2 billion at stake.
Consider: Would you have made the Rogers deal using the insights from this simulation?
```

## Element 6: Strategic Considerations (Hints)

### Details Content:
```
Title: ◆ Strategic Considerations (Open if you're stuck)

Not sure how to approach this simulation? Here are some frameworks:

**Customer Lifetime Value (LTV):**
How long will subscribers stay? If average subscriber stays 18 months at $19.99/month,
their LTV is ~$360. How much can you spend to acquire them? How much on content to
retain them?

**Content Portfolio Strategy:**
• Anchor Properties: High-cost, broad appeal (e.g., NHL, NBA) - drive subscriptions
• Niche Properties: Lower-cost, targeted appeal (e.g., esports, rugby) - reduce churn
• Emerging Properties: Speculative bets (e.g., women's sports, new leagues) - differentiation

**The Streaming Profitability Paradox:**
Growth requires spending on content AND customer acquisition. Profitability requires
reducing both. Most streaming services lose money for 3-5 years building scale.

**Pricing Strategy:**
• Too low: Can't cover content costs, perceived as low-quality
• Too high: Small addressable market, high churn risk
• Sweet spot: Premium enough to signal quality, accessible enough for mass market

**Rights Negotiation:**
• Exclusive rights cost 2-3x more than non-exclusive
• Multi-year deals lock in costs but reduce flexibility
• Regional rights (Canada-only) cheaper than global but smaller audience

**Engagement Investments:**
Beyond just streaming games, consider: interactive features, fantasy integration,
social viewing, original content (documentaries, shoulder programming).
These reduce churn but add costs.

**Key Question:**
What is your differentiation? Why do subscribers choose YOU over competitors?
```

**Design Rationale:**
- **iFrame tool** provides experiential learning of complex economics (UDL engagement, Application level)
- **Infobox** clearly frames task and connects to WLOs (QM clarity)
- **Reflection prompt** encourages metacognition and case study preparation (transfer)
- **AI Chat** offers adaptive support for struggling students (UDL scaffolding)
- **Details** provides strategic frameworks without prescribing answers (progressive disclosure)
- Multiple paths to profitability - no single "right" strategy (UDL choice)
- Directly prepares students to evaluate Rogers deal critically (WLO 2.4)
