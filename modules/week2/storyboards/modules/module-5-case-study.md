### Element 1: Infobox - Case Overview

```
Title: Case Study: Rogers Communications - The $5.2 Billion NHL Bet ‚ñ∏

Context:
In 2013, Rogers Communications shocked the sports media world by paying $5.2 billion for exclusive Canadian NHL rights‚Äî12 years, all platforms, all games. It was the largest sports media deal in Canadian history and a massive strategic bet on hockey's enduring value.

Key Questions for Analysis:
1. How did Rogers value the NHL rights at $5.2 billion? What assumptions did they make?
2. What were the strategic goals beyond pure ROI (e.g., brand positioning, competitive defense)?
3. How did the deal perform vs. expectations? What went right and wrong?
4. What should Rogers do in 2026 when the deal expires?

This case addresses all Week 2 MLOs:
‚Ä¢ MLO 2.1: Rights valuation methodology
‚Ä¢ MLO 2.2: Platform strategy (linear Sportsnet + streaming)
‚Ä¢ MLO 2.3: Fan engagement and monetization tactics
‚Ä¢ MLO 2.4: Evaluation of mega-deal success/failure

```markdown
# Rogers Communications: Company Background (2013)

**Who:** Rogers Communications, Canada's largest telecommunications and media company. In 2013, Rogers owned:
- Rogers Wireless (largest mobile carrier, 9.5M subscribers)
- Rogers Cable (cable TV and internet, 2.3M subscribers)
- **Sportsnet** (sports broadcasting network, distant #2 to TSN)

**Strategic Challenge:** By 2013, Rogers faced existential threats:
- Cord-cutting accelerating (cable subscribers declining 5%/year)
- TSN (Bell Media) dominated sports broadcasting with NHL, NBA, CFL, FIFA
- Netflix and streaming disrupting traditional TV

**The Opportunity:** NHL's Canadian rights deal with CBC/TSN was expiring in 2014. Rogers saw a chance to acquire the crown jewel of Canadian sports and transform Sportsnet from challenger to leader.

**The Stakes:** A $5.2B bet‚Äîequivalent to 15% of Rogers' entire market capitalization. Success could secure Rogers' media future. Failure could cripple the company for a decade.

**Next: Explore the deal terms and what Rogers got for $5.2 billion.**

### Element 4: Widget 5 - Rogers Deal Terms Explorer

### ‚öô Interactive Activity: Rogers Deal Terms Explorer

**Practice: MLO 2.4 (Evaluate the Rogers $5.2B NHL deal and its implications)**

You've learned how media rights are valued and how platforms make money. Now analyze the most famous‚Äîand controversial‚Äîmedia rights deal in Canadian history: Rogers' $5.2 billion, 12-year exclusive NHL agreement. What exactly did $5.2 billion buy? Was it worth it?

In this interactive activity, you'll explore 5 tabs revealing what Rogers acquired: Rights Included (1,000+ games per season), Platforms Covered (linear TV, streaming, digital, radio), Exclusivity Terms (near-monopoly on NHL in Canada), Revenue Projections (Rogers forecasted break-even by Year 5), and Comparison to Previous Deal (209% more expensive than CBC/TSN's prior deal). Click through each tab to understand the deal's scope.

**What you'll discover:**

- The sheer SCOPE of $433M/year‚ÄîRogers bought every meaningful NHL touchpoint in Canada
- Why exclusivity commanded such a premium (TSN lost access entirely; Rogers could control distribution strategy)
- Rogers' internal revenue projections assumed 1M Sportsnet NOW subscribers by Year 5‚Äîspoiler: they never reached half that
- That the deal was 209% more expensive than the previous one‚Äîeither Rogers overpaid or the NHL was vastly undervalued before

**Time commitment:** 5-6 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** MLO 2.4 (Evaluate Rogers deal terms, projections, and strategic rationale)

---

**üéÆ Widget Purpose:** Let students explore the comprehensive terms of the Rogers NHL deal interactively, understanding what $5.2B bought.

   - **Platforms Covered:** Where games could be shown
   - **Exclusivity Terms:** What competitors lost
   - **Revenue Projections:** What Rogers expected to earn
   - **Comparison to Previous Deal:** How much more Rogers paid

**Tab Content:**

**Tab 1: Rights Included**
- ‚úÖ All national games (Hockey Night in Canada - Saturday nights)
- ‚úÖ All regional games (all 7 Canadian teams - 82 games √ó 7 = 574 regional games)
- ‚úÖ All playoff games (Stanley Cup Playoffs - Canadian teams + all rounds)
- ‚úÖ International tournaments (World Cup of Hockey, Olympics qualifier games)
- ‚úÖ Shoulder programming (pre-game, post-game, highlight shows)
- **Total:** 1,000+ games per season + shoulder content

- üíª Digital: Sportsnet.ca website, mobile apps
- üìª Radio: Sportsnet Radio network
- **Flexibility:** Rogers controlled all platforms (could shift games based on strategy)

**Tab 3: Exclusivity Terms**
- üö´ TSN lost national rights (previously co-held with CBC)
- üö´ CBC retained Hockey Night in Canada brand but sublicensed from Rogers (free over-air broadcast Saturdays)
- üö´ No other Canadian broadcaster could show NHL games (except CBC sublicense)
- ‚úÖ Regional rights for some teams retained by others (e.g., TSN had regional Ottawa Senators rights)
- **Result:** Rogers had near-monopoly on NHL content in Canada

**Tab 4: Revenue Projections (Rogers' Internal Forecast)**
- **Year 1 (2014-15):** $300M revenue (advertising + Sportsnet NOW subscriptions)
- **Year 3 (2016-17):** $425M revenue (subscriber growth + premium ad rates)

- **Year 7 (2020-21):** $550M revenue (sustained profitability)
- **Assumptions:** 1M Sportsnet NOW subscribers by Year 5 @ $25/month + stable linear TV ad revenue

**Tab 5: Comparison to Previous Deal**
- **Previous (CBC/TSN 2004-2014):** $1.4B over 10 years = $140M/year
- **Rogers (2014-2026):** $5.2B over 12 years = $433M/year
- **Increase:** 209% higher per year ($433M vs. $140M)
- **Per-game cost:** Previous: $140K/game ‚Üí Rogers: $433K/game (3x increase)
- **Justification:** Exclusivity premium + digital rights + inflation + NHL's growing Canadian fanbase

**Learning Objectives:**
- **MLO 2.4:** Understand comprehensive scope of rights deal (not just TV games)
- **MLO 2.1:** Recognize valuation factors (exclusivity, platform flexibility, content volume)
- Appreciate why Rogers paid 3x more than previous deal (exclusivity + digital platforms)
- Understand revenue projection assumptions (critical for later analysis when projections fail)

**Accessibility:**
- ‚úÖ Keyboard navigation (Tab to switch tabs, Enter to activate)
- ‚úÖ ARIA tabs pattern (role="tablist", aria-selected)
- ‚úÖ Screen reader announces tab content when switching

### üí° FINANCIAL ANALYSIS TUTORIAL: How to Read Case Exhibits

**Quick Guide (2 minutes)** - Before you analyze Rogers' performance, learn how to read financial projections like an MBA analyst.

**1. Variance Analysis (Projected vs. Actual)**
- **What it is:** Compare what was forecasted to what actually happened
- **How to calculate:** Variance = Actual - Projected (negative = shortfall, positive = beat expectations)
- **What to look for:** Consistent misses suggest flawed assumptions (not just bad luck)
- **Example:** Rogers projected $500M Year 5 revenue, actual was $350M ‚Üí -$150M variance (30% shortfall)

**2. Break-Even Analysis**
- **What it is:** When does revenue exceed costs? When does cumulative profit turn positive?
- **Red flag:** Break-even keeps getting pushed back (Year 5 ‚Üí Year 7 ‚Üí Never)
- **Rogers reality:** Projected break-even Year 5. Actual: Never achieved after 10 years.

**3. Key Metrics to Track**
- **Revenue growth rate:** Is it accelerating or decelerating?
- **Cost structure:** Are costs fixed or variable? Can they flex down if revenue misses?
- **Cumulative profit/loss:** Add up annual profits/losses to see total financial impact
- **ROI calculation:** (Total Return - Total Investment) / Total Investment

**4. Common Red Flags**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Overly optimistic growth rates** (e.g., "subscribers will grow 100%/year for 5 years")
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No downside scenarios** (what if things go wrong?)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Missing force majeure clauses** (COVID, strikes, lockouts)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Revenue projections that assume "build it and they will come"** without customer acquisition strategy

**üéØ Use This Framework:** As you explore Rogers' financial data in the next widgets, ask yourself: Where did projections go wrong? What assumptions failed? Could this have been predicted?

### Element 5: Text - Strategic Rationale (150 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# Why Rogers Paid $5.2 Billion: The Strategic Rationale

Rogers' board approved the $5.2B bid despite knowing it would lose money for 3-5 years. **Why?**

## Defensive Strategy: Protect the Core Business
- Cable subscribers were cancelling at 5%/year (cord-cutting accelerating)
- NHL games were **the #1 reason Canadians kept cable** (survey: 42% said "hockey" was must-have)
- Losing NHL rights would accelerate cord-cutting ‚Üí death spiral for cable business
- **Logic:** Pay $433M/year to prevent $1B+/year cable revenue loss

## Offensive Strategy: Build Streaming Brand
- Sportsnet NOW (streaming service) launched 2016 with NHL as exclusive content
- Target: 1M+ subscribers by Year 5 @ $25/month = $300M/year new revenue
- Position Sportsnet as **Canada's sports streaming destination** before Netflix, DAZN, Apple entered

## Competitive Defense: Hurt TSN (Bell Media)
- TSN (Rogers' main competitor) lost national NHL rights
- Weakened TSN's #1 sports brand positioning
- Rogers could justify cable carriage fee increases ("We have NHL, TSN doesn't")

**Next: What actually happened? (Spoiler: Most assumptions proved wrong)**

### Element 6: Video - Executive Retrospective (2 minutes)

**Video Specifications:**
- **File:** `week2-rogers-retrospective.mp4`
- **Duration:** 2 minutes
- **VTT Transcript:** `week2-rogers-retrospective.vtt` (required)
- **Video Title:** "Rogers NHL Deal: 10 Years Later - What Went Wrong (and Right)"

**Script Content:**

```
[0:00-0:20] Introduction
"In 2013, Rogers bet $5.2 billion on NHL hockey. Ten years later, the deal is widely considered a financial disaster. But was it a complete failure? Let's analyze what went right and wrong."

[0:20-0:45] What Went Wrong
"Three major miscalculations sank profitability:
1. Cord-cutting accelerated faster than projected‚Äîcable subscribers declined 28% vs. 15% expected
2. Sportsnet NOW reached only 450K subscribers vs. 1M target‚Äîexclusive hockey wasn't enough
3. COVID-19 devastated Year 7 revenue (projected $550M, actual $200M)‚Äîno force majeure clause in contract"

[0:45-1:10] What Went Right (Sort Of)
"Rogers DID achieve some strategic goals:
1. Defended cable subscribers‚Äîwithout NHL, decline would've been 35-40% instead of 28%
2. Established Sportsnet as Canada's sports brand‚Äîbrand value increased despite financial losses
3. Built streaming infrastructure‚ÄîSportsnet NOW technology platform now supports other content"

[1:10-1:35] The Financial Reality
"Cumulative losses estimated at $1.5 billion over 10 years. Annual losses: $50-150M/year.
Rogers never achieved profitability. Break-even pushed from Year 5 ‚Üí Year 7 ‚Üí Never."

[1:35-2:00] 2026 Decision Ahead
"Contract expires 2026. Rogers must decide: Renew? Renegotiate? Walk away?
NHL knows Rogers overpaid. Next deal will likely be 30-40% less ($300M/year range).
Question: Is NHL still worth it at ANY price given streaming disruption?"

### Element 7: Text - Performance Overview (150 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# What Actually Happened: 2014-2024 Performance

Rogers' optimistic projections collided with harsh market realities.

## Financial Performance (vs. Projections)
- **Year 1:** Revenue $280M (projected $300M) ‚ùå Below target
- **Year 3:** Revenue $310M (projected $425M) ‚ùå 27% shortfall
- **Year 5:** Revenue $350M (projected $500M) ‚ùå 30% shortfall
- **Year 7 (COVID):** Revenue $200M (projected $550M) ‚ùå 64% shortfall
- **Year 10:** Revenue $380M (projected $600M+) ‚ùå Still unprofitable

## Three Critical Failures
1. **Advertising Revenue Collapsed:** Cord-cutting reduced linear TV viewership faster than Sportsnet NOW growth offset it
2. **Streaming Underperformance:** 450K subscribers vs. 1M target (55% shortfall) ‚Üí $150M/year revenue gap
3. **No Flexibility:** Contract had no force majeure clause‚ÄîCOVID losses couldn't be renegotiated

**Cumulative Result:** $1.5B+ total losses over 10 years. Never achieved profitability.

**Next: Explore the data behind these failures.**

### Element 8: Widget 6 - Projections vs. Actuals Visualizer

### ‚öô Interactive Activity: Projections vs. Actuals Visualizer

**Practice: MLO 2.4 (Evaluate Rogers deal performance)**

Rogers projected break-even by Year 5 ($500M revenue). By Year 10, they were still losing $50-150M annually. But where exactly did the projections go wrong? And by how much?

In this interactive activity, you'll scrub through a 10-year timeline (2014-2024) comparing three lines: Rogers' original revenue projections (blue), actual revenue achieved (red), and the break-even threshold at $433M/year (green horizontal line). Hover over any year to see detailed variance breakdowns and key events (e.g., Year 7: COVID-19 devastated revenue, projected $550M, actual $200M, -64% variance).

**What you'll discover:**

- Rogers' projections were optimistic from Day 1‚Äîeven Year 1 actuals fell short by 15%
- The gap WIDENED over time‚Äîby Year 5, actuals were 40% below projections
- COVID-19 wasn't the main problem (though it crushed Year 7)‚Äîcord-cutting and failed streaming adoption were
- Rogers NEVER crossed the break-even line in 10 years‚Äîlosses totaled ~$1.5B

**Time commitment:** 7-8 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** MLO 2.4 (Evaluate mega-deal performance through variance analysis)

## üèÜ MODULE 5A COMPLETE: Deal Context Mastered

**You've completed Module 5A!** You now understand:
‚úÖ Rogers' $5.2B NHL deal structure and comprehensive terms
‚úÖ Strategic rationale: Why Rogers paid 3x the previous deal
‚úÖ Financial performance: Rogers never achieved profitability

**üéñÔ∏è Achievement Unlocked:** "Deal Context Mastered"

**Coming Next in Module 5B:** Performance analysis, competitive dynamics, and the critical 2026 decision. You'll use your understanding of the deal context to evaluate Rogers' mistakes and recommend next steps.

**Optional Break:** This is a good moment to pause (5B is another 13 minutes). Return when you're ready to analyze what went wrong and what Rogers should do in 2026.

---

## üéØ FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION

**How Module 5A Supports Your Final Strategic Vision:**

Module 5A analyzed the Rogers/NHL deal structure and rationale. This template applies directly to evaluating media deals for YOUR property in Week 5.

**What You Learned:**
- How to structure billion-dollar media rights deals (term, exclusivity, rights scope, revenue model)
- Strategic rationale for paying premiums (Rogers paid 3√ó previous deal based on assumptions about streaming growth and hockey's cultural primacy)
- Deal modeling: projected revenue streams vs. costs over 12-year term

**How to Apply This to Your Final Project:**

When you design your 5-year media strategy in Week 5, Module 5A's deal structure framework guides your approach:

- **Rights Package Definition:** Define what your property offers media partners. Example: "Our property offers exclusive domestic streaming rights + non-exclusive linear broadcast rights, following Rogers' hybrid model but learning from their overreliance on exclusivity."
- **Valuation Justification:** Rogers' $5.2B valuation assumed specific audience/engagement metrics. Your vision must justify media rights value using similar frameworks: audience size √ó engagement √ó demographics √ó exclusivity premium.
- **Risk Assessment:** Module 5A showed Rogers' optimistic assumptions. Your vision should stress-test assumptions: "What if streaming subscribers grow 50% slower than projected? What if cord-cutting accelerates?"

**Real-World Application:** The Rogers case is a cautionary tale. Your Week 5 capstone must avoid Rogers' mistakes: overoptimistic projections, insufficient flexibility, underestimating disruption.

### Element 9: Infobox (Note) - Key Insight: Why Forecasts Failed

```
Title: ‚ñ∂ Critical Insight: The Forecasting Failure

Rogers' projections failed for three interconnected reasons:

1. **Underestimated Cord-Cutting Speed**
   - Assumed linear TV would decline 15% over 10 years
   - Actual: 28% decline (nearly double)
   - Impact: $150M/year advertising revenue shortfall

2. **Overestimated Streaming Adoption**
   - Assumed NHL-only service would attract 1M+ subscribers
   - Actual: Hockey alone wasn't enough‚Äîfans wanted multi-sport (DAZN model)
   - Impact: $150M/year subscription revenue shortfall

3. **No Scenario Planning for Black Swan Events**
   - Contract had no force majeure clause (COVID, lockouts, other disruptions)
   - Impact: $350M loss in Year 7 with no recourse

**Lesson:** Media rights deals require scenario planning. Rogers optimized for "base case" and had no hedge for downside risks. NHL's next deal will include flexibility clauses.
```

### Element 10: Text - Audience Trends (150 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# Viewership Trends: The Audience Story

Beyond financial projections, Rogers faced declining and fragmented audiences.

## National Broadcast Ratings (Hockey Night in Canada)
- **2013-14 (Pre-Rogers):** 1.8M average viewers (baseline)
- **2014-15 (Year 1):** 1.6M viewers (-11%) ‚¨áÔ∏è Weak Canadian teams
- **2023-24 (Year 10):** 1.3M viewers (-28% vs. baseline) ‚¨áÔ∏è Continued erosion

## Why Viewership Declined
1. **Canadian Team Performance:** Only 1-2 Canadian teams made playoffs most years (reduces "must-watch" games)
2. **Generational Shift:** Younger audiences (18-34) prefer highlights and social clips over 3-hour games
3. **Competition:** More viewing options (Netflix, gaming, other sports) fragment attention

## Sportsnet NOW Subscriber Growth (Too Slow)
- **2016 (Launch):** 50K subscribers
- **2020 (Target Year 5):** 350K subscribers (vs. 1M target)
- **2024 (Current):** 450K subscribers ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Growth stalled

**Lesson:** Exclusive content isn't enough if underlying audience is declining. Rogers needed multi-sport strategy like DAZN.

**Next: Explore viewership data interactively.**

### Element 11: Widget 7 - Viewership Trends Analyzer

### ‚öô Interactive Activity: Viewership Trends Analyzer

**Practice: MLO 2.3 (Understand fan engagement challenges) & MLO 2.4 (Analyze market dynamics)**

Rogers lost $1.5B on the NHL deal. But what were the underlying AUDIENCE trends driving those losses? Did viewership decline? Did younger fans stop watching? Did streaming adoption stall?

In this interactive activity, you'll explore 3 tabs of audience data: (1) Linear TV Ratings showing Hockey Night in Canada's Saturday night viewership from 2014-2024, (2) Sportsnet NOW Subscribers tracking streaming growth vs. Rogers' 1M target, and (3) Demographic Breakdown revealing which age groups, genders, and regions engaged‚Äîand which didn't. Filter by year, hover for details, and identify the trends Rogers missed.

**What you'll discover:**

- Hockey Night in Canada ratings declined 35% over 10 years‚Äîsteady erosion, not sudden collapse
- Sportsnet NOW peaked at 450K subscribers (55% short of target)‚Äîhockey alone wasn't a streaming driver
- Viewers aged 18-34 declined 50% while 55+ held steady‚Äîaging audience crisis
- Regional disparities: Toronto/Montreal strong, Vancouver/Calgary declining‚Äînot all Canadian markets equal

**Time commitment:** 8-9 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** MLO 2.3 (Fan engagement patterns), MLO 2.4 (Market trend analysis)

# The Competitive Landscape: TSN, DAZN, and New Entrants

While Rogers struggled with the NHL deal, competitors evolved with diversified strategies.

## TSN (Bell Media): The Diversification Winner
- **Lost:** NHL national rights to Rogers (painful in 2014)
- **Pivoted:** Acquired CFL, NBA, FIFA World Cup, MLS regional, curling, tennis
- **Result:** Multi-sport strategy created stable revenue (no single property = 50% of costs)
- **TSN Direct (streaming):** Launched 2018, reached 400K subscribers by 2024 (vs. Sportsnet NOW 450K)

## DAZN Canada: The Disruptor
- **Launched:** 2017 with soccer (EPL, Champions League, Serie A) + boxing + NFL
- **Strategy:** Lower price ($24.99 vs. Sportsnet $27.99), multi-sport, niche fan targeting
- **Subscribers:** 300K by 2020 (competitive with Sportsnet NOW despite later launch)

## Apple TV+ / Amazon: The Tech Giants
- **Apple:** MLS exclusive deal ($2.5B, 2023-2032) ‚Üí Global strategy, not ROI-focused
- **Amazon:** NFL Thursday Night Football ‚Üí Subscription driver for Prime

**Lesson:** Rogers' single-property bet looked increasingly risky as market fragmented and tech giants entered with deep pockets.

**Next: Compare Rogers' strategy to competitors.**

### Element 12: Table - Rogers vs. Competitors Comparison

| **Company** | **Rights Portfolio** | **Annual Rights Costs** | **Streaming Strategy** | **2024 Subscribers** | **Profitability** | **Strategic Approach** |
|------------|---------------------|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Rogers (Sportsnet)** | NHL exclusive | $433M/year | Sportsnet NOW (NHL-only) | 450K | ‚ùå Unprofitable (10 years) | Single-property bet, defensive strategy |
| **Bell (TSN)** | Multi-sport (CFL, NBA, FIFA, MLS) | $250M/year total | TSN Direct (multi-sport) | 400K | ‚úÖ Profitable Year 3 | Diversification, lower risk |
| **DAZN Canada** | Soccer, boxing, NFL, combat sports | $50M/year | DAZN multi-sport | 300K | ‚úÖ Profitable Year 4 | Niche targeting, global content |
| **Apple TV+** | MLS exclusive (global) | $250M/year | Apple TV+ bundle | 2M+ (MLS Season Pass) | ‚ùå Strategic investment (not ROI-focused) | Tech giant deep pockets, global strategy |

**Table Caption:** "Canadian Sports Streaming Competitive Landscape (2024)"

**Key Takeaway:**
Rogers' single-property, NHL-exclusive strategy created concentration risk. TSN's multi-sport portfolio and DAZN's niche targeting proved more resilient. Tech giants (Apple, Amazon) can afford "strategic losses" that traditional broadcasters cannot.

### Element 13: Text - The 2026 Decision (150 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# 2026: Renew, Renegotiate, or Walk Away?

Rogers' NHL contract expires after the 2025-26 season. The company must decide its next move.

## Three Options on the Table

**Option 1: Renew at Reduced Price**
- NHL knows Rogers overpaid and lost money
- Next deal likely $300-350M/year (30% reduction)
- **Pros:** Keep NHL content, spread costs over longer term (15 years?), flexibility clauses (force majeure)
- **Cons:** Still a massive bet, streaming market even more competitive, younger demos not watching full games

**Option 2: Split Rights Package**
- Rogers takes regional (7 Canadian teams) + streaming
- TSN or Amazon takes national (Saturday nights)
- **Pros:** Lower cost ($200M/year range), shared risk, broader distribution
- **Cons:** Lose exclusivity competitive advantage, coordination challenges

**Option 3: Walk Away Completely**
- Let TSN, DAZN, Apple, or Amazon bid for NHL
- Rogers focuses on other sports or exits sports media
- **Pros:** Cut losses, reallocate capital, focus on wireless/cable core business
- **Cons:** Lose sports brand identity, accelerate cable cord-cutting (NHL was subscriber retention tool)

**Your Task:** What would YOU recommend? Use the decision simulator to explore trade-offs.

### Element 14: Widget 8 - 2026 Decision Simulator (CAPSTONE)

### ‚öô CAPSTONE Activity: 2026 Decision Simulator

**Synthesis: ALL 4 MLOs (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4) ‚Äî This is your Week 2 capstone**

The year is 2026. Rogers' $5.2 billion NHL contract expires. After losing $1.5 billion over 12 years, Rogers CEO asks you: "Should we renew? If so, at what price and on what terms? Or should we walk away?" There's no "right" answer‚Äîonly defensible strategic recommendations supported by evidence.

This capstone simulation integrates EVERYTHING you've learned in Week 2. You'll set market assumptions (cord-cutting rate, streaming growth, NHL viewership trends, competitive intensity, betting revenue), choose from 3 options (renew exclusive $300-350M/year, split package $200M/year, or walk away), view 10-year financial projections for your choice, compare alternatives side-by-side, and write an executive recommendation (250 words) justifying your decision. Export your full analysis as PDF.

**What this capstone tests:**

- **MLO 2.1:** Can you value NHL rights in 2026 given changed market conditions? (Apply frameworks from Widgets 1-2)
- **MLO 2.2:** Can you evaluate platform strategies (exclusive vs. split vs. exit)? (Apply economics from Widget 3)
- **MLO 2.3:** Can you assess fan engagement opportunities (betting, apps, exclusive content)? (Apply insights from Widget 4)
- **MLO 2.4:** Can you synthesize financial, competitive, and strategic factors into ONE coherent recommendation? (Demonstrate Bloom's Synthesis/Evaluation level)

**Time commitment:** 15-20 minutes (most complex widget, highest pedagogical value)
**Learning outcomes synthesized:** ALL Week 2 MLOs (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4)

**Note:** This is Week 2's capstone demonstration of mastery. Your recommendation will inform your Week 2 reflection memo.

### ü§ñ AI CASE ANALYSIS COACH

**AI Chat Widget Configuration** - Available throughout Module 5 to guide your case analysis thinking

**Widget Name:** "Rogers Case Analysis Coach"

**Purpose:** Provide Socratic guidance for case analysis without giving direct answers. Help students apply frameworks, develop evidence-based reasoning, and prepare for their Mini-Case Memo.

**System Prompt:**
```
You are a case analysis coach for MBA students working on the Rogers NHL rights deal case study. Your role is to ask probing Socratic questions that help students think critically, NOT to provide direct answers or write content for them.

When students ask for help:
1. Ask clarifying questions: "What data have you looked at? What patterns do you notice?"
2. Point them to relevant frameworks: "Have you applied the rights valuation framework from Module 3? How do the 5 factors play out here?"
3. Challenge assumptions: "You said Rogers made a mistake. What evidence supports that? Could there be another interpretation?"
4. Help structure thinking: "Let's break this down. What were Rogers' goals? What actually happened? Where's the gap?"
5. Encourage synthesis: "You've identified three mistakes. How do they connect? Is there a pattern?"

DO NOT:
- Write memo content for students
- Provide direct answers to case questions
- Give "the right answer" (there isn't one)
- Do financial calculations for them (teach them HOW instead)

DO:
- Ask "why" and "how" questions
- Reference specific data points from widgets: "Look at the Widget 6 variance data. What do you notice about Year 5?"
- Connect to Week 2 frameworks: "How does this relate to platform economics we learned in Module 3?"
- Help students develop confidence in their reasoning: "That's a solid insight. What evidence would make it even stronger?"

Tone: Supportive but challenging. Like a good professor during office hours.
```

**Welcome Message:**
"Hi! I'm here to help you think through the Rogers case analysis. I won't write your memo, but I'll ask questions to help you develop stronger arguments. What aspect of the case are you working on?"

**Show System Prompt to User:** No

**Uplimit Implementation Notes:**
- Place widget at end of Module 5 (after Element 15)
- Make available as optional support tool
- Students can access anytime during Module 5 work
- Widget persists conversation (students can come back)

**Sample Interactions:**

**Student:** "What should I say about Rogers' mistakes?"
**Coach:** "Great question! Let's think this through together. First, what data have you explored? Have you looked at the Widget 6 financial projections vs. actuals? What patterns jump out at you?"

**Student:** "I think Rogers overpaid"
**Coach:** "Interesting perspective. What does 'overpaid' mean to you? Compared to what benchmark? Walk me through your reasoning."

**Student:** "I'm stuck on the 2026 recommendation"
**Coach:** "Let's break this down. What are Rogers' options? For each option, what would you need to believe for it to be the right choice? Which assumptions seem most realistic given what you've learned?"

## üåü MENTAL BREAK #4: Prepare to Write (CRITICAL BREAK)

**You've completed:** ALL Week 2 learning content (framework + simulation + case)
**Coming next:** Mini-Case Memo assessment (2-page written analysis)

**Take a moment to:**
- **Stand and walk for 5 minutes** (critical for mental clarity before writing)
- Stretch your neck, shoulders, and wrists
- Get water, use the restroom, grab a snack
- Review your notes from the Rogers case
- Set up your writing environment (quiet space, no distractions)

**Progress:** You're 90% through Week 2! You've learned media valuation frameworks, simulated platform strategy, and analyzed a real $5.2B deal. Now you'll synthesize everything into an executive memo.

*DO NOT SKIP THIS BREAK. Writing requires fresh mental energy. Take at least 5-10 minutes. Consider this your "pre-game" before the assessment. You've got this!*

**Pro tip:** Before you start writing, take 2 minutes to jot down your 3 main points on scratch paper. This roadmap will make your memo stronger.

## üéØ FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION

**How Module 5B Supports Your Final Strategic Vision:**

Module 5B analyzed Rogers' performance failures and 2026 decision. This post-mortem analysis teaches risk management for your Week 5 capstone.

**What You Learned:**
- What went wrong: advertising collapsed, streaming underperformed, no contractual flexibility for black swan events (COVID)
- How to evaluate strategic mistakes using data (projected vs. actual variance analysis)
- Strategic decision frameworks for renewing, renegotiating, or exiting media deals

**How to Apply This to Your Final Project:**

When you craft your 5-year strategic vision in Week 5, Module 5B's failure analysis informs your risk management:

- **Scenario Planning:** Rogers assumed linear decline would be gradual. Your vision must include downside scenarios. Example: "If cord-cutting accelerates 2√ó faster than baseline, our media revenue declines from $500M (Year 1) to $300M (Year 5). Mitigation: diversify into DTC and retain 30% revenue from non-media streams."
- **Contractual Flexibility:** Rogers had no force majeure clause. Your vision should specify deal terms that protect downside: "Seek performance-based revenue share vs. guaranteed fees, with renegotiation triggers if viewership declines >20%."
- **Post-Investment Review:** Module 5B taught how to evaluate deals ex-post. Your vision should include monitoring KPIs and decision points: "If streaming subs <500K by Year 2, pivot from DTC to licensing model."

**Real-World Application:** Rogers lost $1.5B+ over 10 years. Your Week 5 capstone must demonstrate you've learned from their mistakes: conservative projections, downside protection, strategic flexibility.
