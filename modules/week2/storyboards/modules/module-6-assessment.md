## Element 1: Connecting Introduction

You've just analyzed the Rogers/NHL mega-deal through multiple lenses (Module 5)—watching the 10-year retrospective, exploring financial exhibits, and using interactive widgets to project scenarios. You understand the deal's context, structure, and outcomes.

Now it's time to demonstrate your mastery. Module 6 is your Week 2 summative assessment: a strategic mini-case memo evaluating the Rogers deal and recommending next steps. This assessment uses a scaffolded approach with AI feedback to develop your strategic thinking.

---

## Element 2: Assessment Overview (Infobox - Insight)

### Infobox Content (Element 2):
```
Title: ▪ Assessment: Rogers NHL Deal Mini-Case Memo (Scaffolded Approach)

**Your Task:**
Write a 2-page executive memo (max 1000 words) evaluating the Rogers NHL deal and providing strategic recommendations for the 2026 decision.

**How This Works (4-Step Scaffolded Process):**

To help you write a stronger memo, this assessment is broken into 3 micro-steps with AI feedback BEFORE you write your final memo:

1. **Micro-Step 1:** Identify 3 key mistakes Rogers made (3 bullets, AI feedback)
2. **Micro-Step 2:** Evaluate the deal using Week 2 frameworks (1 paragraph, AI feedback)
3. **Micro-Step 3:** Recommend Rogers' 2026 strategy (1 paragraph, AI feedback)
4. **Final Memo:** Synthesize all 3 micro-steps into polished 2-page executive memo

**Why This Approach?**
- Each micro-step earns 5 participation points (15 pts total)
- AI feedback helps you strengthen arguments BEFORE final submission
- Reduces writing anxiety by building confidence through small wins
- Final memo is worth 40 points (graded with full rubric)

**Prompt:**
You are a consultant hired by Rogers Communications in 2024 to assess the NHL deal's performance and recommend next steps.

**Requirements:**
• Complete all 3 micro-steps first (AI will provide feedback)
• Then write final 2-page memo (max 1000 words)
• Executive memo format (To/From/Date/Re)
• Apply concepts from readings, executive session, and simulation
• Reference specific data from case widgets (Widgets 6, 7, 8)
• Due: [Date] by 11:59 PM

**Total Points:** 56 points (15 micro-steps + 40 final memo + 1 AI feedback bonus)

**Optional AI Feedback Bonus (1 point):**
- Generate AI feedback on your draft using ChatGPT prompt provided
- Submit the AI feedback as evidence of engagement

**⏱️ Total Time Investment:** 2-3 hours
- Micro-steps (1-3): 30-45 min
- Final memo: 60-90 min
- AI feedback (optional): 5-10 min

**WLOs Assessed:** 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
```

## Element 3: Micro-Step 1 - Key Mistakes (Text Response)

**Question Text:**
```
MICRO-STEP 1: Identify Rogers' Key Mistakes

List 3 specific mistakes Rogers made in the NHL deal. For each mistake, provide:
• What went wrong (1 sentence)
• Evidence from the case data (reference specific numbers from Widgets 6, 7, or 8)

Format: Use bullet points. Be specific and evidence-based.

Example:
• Mistake 1: [What went wrong]. Evidence: [Widget X shows Y data point].
• Mistake 2: [What went wrong]. Evidence: [specific number from case].
• Mistake 3: [What went wrong]. Evidence: [comparison or variance].
```

**AI Feedback Configuration:**
- ✅ Enable AI feedback
- **Feedback Prompt:** "Review this student's 3 key mistakes. For each mistake: (1) Confirm if it's evidence-based and specific, (2) Ask if they can quantify the impact (e.g., revenue shortfall, subscriber gap), (3) Suggest one deeper question they should consider. Be encouraging but push for precision. Example: 'Good start! For Mistake #2, you identified streaming underperformance. Can you quantify the subscriber gap? Widget 6 shows the exact numbers—what percentage did Rogers miss their target by?'"
- **Points:** 5 points (participation credit, not graded rigorously)
- **Purpose:** Build confidence, get students comfortable analyzing data

---

## Element 4: Micro-Step 2 - Deal Evaluation (Text Response)

**Question Text:**
```
MICRO-STEP 2: Evaluate the Deal

Write 1 paragraph (100-150 words) evaluating whether Rogers' $5.2B investment was justified.

Apply Week 2 frameworks:
• Media rights valuation framework (WLO 2.1): Did Rogers properly value audience size, exclusivity, platform flexibility?
• Platform economics (WLO 2.2): Did the linear TV + streaming strategy make sense?
• Fan engagement (WLO 2.3): Did Rogers effectively monetize beyond rights fees?

Was the deal justified given Rogers' strategic goals (defend cable, build Sportsnet brand, enter streaming)?
```

**AI Feedback Configuration:**
- ✅ Enable AI feedback
- **Feedback Prompt:** "Review this student's deal evaluation paragraph. Check: (1) Did they apply at least 2 Week 2 frameworks? (2) Did they distinguish between financial ROI and strategic value? (3) Is their evaluation nuanced (acknowledging both successes and failures)? Provide specific feedback. Example: 'Strong use of the valuation framework! You mentioned exclusivity as a key factor. Now, can you add the platform economics lens? How did Rogers' linear + streaming strategy compare to what you learned in the Streaming Wars simulation? Would a multi-sport approach (like DAZN) have been smarter?'"
- **Points:** 5 points (participation credit)
- **Purpose:** Ensure students apply frameworks, not just opinionate

---

## Element 5: Micro-Step 3 - 2026 Recommendation (Text Response)

**Question Text:**
```
MICRO-STEP 3: 2026 Strategic Recommendation

Write 1 paragraph (100-150 words) recommending what Rogers should do in 2026 when the NHL deal expires.

Choose ONE option and defend it:
• Option 1: Renew exclusive rights (at what price?)
• Option 2: Renegotiate for split package with competitors
• Option 3: Walk away entirely

Your recommendation should:
• State your chosen option clearly
• Provide 2-3 reasons with evidence
• Acknowledge the risks/trade-offs of your choice
• Reference market dynamics (competitors, streaming trends, viewership data)
```

**AI Feedback Configuration:**
- ✅ Enable AI feedback
- **Feedback Prompt:** "Review this student's 2026 recommendation. Check: (1) Is their recommendation clear and specific? (2) Did they provide evidence-based reasons? (3) Did they acknowledge risks/trade-offs? (4) Did they consider competitive landscape and market trends? Provide constructive feedback. Example: 'Clear recommendation! You chose Option 2 (split package). Strong reasons about cost reduction and risk management. Now, what's your Plan B if the NHL refuses to split rights? Also, you mentioned TSN as a potential partner—what makes that partnership viable given the competitive history? Widget 7's competitor data might help you strengthen this argument.'"
- **Points:** 5 points (participation credit)
- **Purpose:** Force students to commit to a position before final memo (builds conviction)

## Element 10: Details - Rubric Examples (Optional)
```
Title: Rubric Details & Example Excerpts

[Expand to see evaluation criteria and examples]

## Deal Evaluation (12 points)

**Excellent (11-12 pts):**
"Applies multiple Week 2 frameworks systematically. Evaluates deal using rights valuation
drivers (audience, exclusivity, volume, brand, strategy fit), platform economics (linear
vs. streaming profitability timelines), and fan engagement monetization. Demonstrates
nuanced understanding of Rogers' strategic rationale vs. financial outcomes."

**Example Excerpt:**
"Rogers' $5.2B valuation assumed three critical drivers: (1) Hockey's enduring Canadian
audience would resist cord-cutting trends [Valuation Driver: Audience], (2) Exclusive
rights would create insurmountable competitive moat [Driver: Exclusivity], and (3)
Sportsnet NOW streaming would achieve 1M+ subscribers by Year 5 at $25/month [Platform
Economics: Subscription revenue]. All three assumptions proved overly optimistic. Actual
streaming subscribers reached only 450K (Exhibit B), advertising revenue declined 33%
due to faster-than-expected cord-cutting, and TSN's diversification strategy proved more
resilient than Rogers anticipated..."

**Proficient (9-10 pts):**
"Applies Week 2 frameworks with some analysis. Evaluates deal using several relevant
concepts. May miss some nuances or fail to integrate all frameworks systematically."

**Developing (6-8 pts):**
"References Week 2 concepts but application is superficial. Evaluation lacks depth or
specificity. May focus on one framework and ignore others."

**Needs Improvement (0-5 pts):**
"Minimal or no application of Week 2 frameworks. Evaluation is purely opinion-based
without supporting analysis."

---

## Mistake Identification (10 points)

**Excellent (9-10 pts):**
"Identifies 2-3 specific, insightful mistakes supported by exhibit data. Goes beyond
obvious errors to reveal strategic misjudgments. Analysis is evidence-based."

**Example Excerpt:**
"Rogers made three critical mistakes: (1) **Overestimated the 'Canadian exceptionalism'
of hockey** - assumed cord-cutting would spare sports fans, but Exhibit A shows ad revenue
declined faster than U.S. trends; (2) **Failed to build differentiated engagement beyond
live games** - Sportsnet NOW was pure streaming with minimal fantasy, social, or interactive
features (contrast with DAZN's multi-sport strategy), leading to high churn; (3) **No
flexibility clause for black swan events** - COVID devastated Year 7 revenue (Exhibit A:
$200M vs. projected $550M) with no force majeure protection in the contract."

**Proficient (7-8 pts):**
"Identifies 2-3 reasonable mistakes with some supporting evidence. Analysis is solid
but may lack depth or miss less obvious strategic errors."

### Student-Facing Text Content:
**Copy this markdown directly into Uplimit BEFORE the widget:**

```markdown
## Your AI Case Analysis Coach

Feeling stuck on your memo? Not sure if your argument is strong enough? Want to test your reasoning before submitting?

Use the **Rogers Case Analysis Coach** as your thinking partner throughout this assessment. This AI coach won't write your memo for you (that would defeat the learning purpose), but it WILL help you develop stronger arguments through Socratic questioning.

### How to Use the Coach

**When to use it:**
- ✅ Testing your micro-step arguments: "Does this mistake I identified make sense?"
- ✅ Clarifying framework application: "How do I apply WLO 2.2 to Rogers' streaming strategy?"
- ✅ Structuring your reasoning: "What's the best way to organize my deal evaluation?"
- ✅ Checking evidence quality: "Is this data point strong enough to support my claim?"

**When NOT to use it:**
- ❌ Asking it to write sections: "Write my 2026 recommendation for me"
- ❌ Generating content wholesale: "What should I say about Rogers' mistakes?"

### What to Expect

The coach will respond with **probing questions** to help you think deeper:
- "What does that data point tell you about Rogers' assumptions?"
- "How does this connect to the valuation framework from Module 3?"
- "What are the underlying assumptions in your recommendation?"
- "What evidence supports that claim? What evidence contradicts it?"

### Example Interaction

**You:** "I think Rogers made a mistake by overestimating streaming subscribers."

**Coach:** "Good start! Let's strengthen that argument. What was their subscriber target? What did they actually achieve? Can you quantify the revenue impact of that gap? And critically—could this have been predicted in 2014, or was it unforeseeable?"

**Why this approach works:** The coach forces you to develop YOUR analysis, not copy someone else's. This builds critical thinking skills that will serve you throughout your MBA and career.

**Ready to start?** Open the Rogers Case Analysis Coach below and ask your first question.
