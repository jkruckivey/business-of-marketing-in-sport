## Element 1: Connecting Introduction

You've just analyzed the Rogers/NHL mega-deal through multiple lenses (Module 5)—watching the 10-year retrospective, exploring financial exhibits, and using interactive tools to project scenarios. You understand the deal's context, structure, and outcomes.

Now it's time to demonstrate your mastery. Module 6 is your Week 2 summative assessment: a strategic mini-case memo evaluating the Rogers deal and recommending next steps. This assessment uses a scaffolded approach with AI feedback to develop your strategic thinking.

---

## Element 2: Assessment Overview (Infobox - Insight)

### Infobox Content (Element 2):
```
Title: ▪ Assessment: Rogers NHL Deal Mini-Case Memo (Scaffolded Approach)

**Your Task:**
Write a 2-page executive memo (max 1000 words) evaluating the Rogers NHL deal and providing strategic recommendations for the 2026 decision.

**How This Works (4-Step Scaffolded Process):**

To help you write a stronger memo, this assessment is broken into 3 micro-steps with AI feedback BEFORE you write your final memo:

1. **Micro-Step 1:** Identify 3 key mistakes Rogers made (3 bullets, AI feedback)
2. **Micro-Step 2:** Evaluate the deal using Week 2 frameworks (1 paragraph, AI feedback)
3. **Micro-Step 3:** Recommend Rogers' 2026 strategy (1 paragraph, AI feedback)
4. **Final Memo:** Synthesize all 3 micro-steps into polished 2-page executive memo

**Why This Approach?**
- AI feedback on each micro-step helps you strengthen arguments BEFORE final submission
- Reduces writing anxiety by building confidence through small wins
- Final memo is graded with full rubric

**Prompt:**
You are a consultant hired by Rogers Communications in 2024 to assess the NHL deal's performance and recommend next steps.

**Requirements:**
• Complete all 3 micro-steps first (AI will provide feedback)
• Then write final 2-page memo (max 1000 words)
• Executive memo format (To/From/Date/Re)
• Apply concepts from readings, executive session, and simulation
• Reference specific data from Module 5 interactive exhibits
• Due: [Date] by 11:59 PM

**Optional AI Feedback Bonus:**
- Generate AI feedback on your draft using ChatGPT prompt provided
- Submit the AI feedback as evidence of engagement

**⏱️ Total Time Investment:** 2-3 hours
- Micro-steps (1-3): 30-45 min
- Final memo: 60-90 min
- AI feedback (optional): 5-10 min

**WLOs Assessed:** 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4

## Element 10: Details - Rubric Examples (Optional)
```
Title: Rubric Details & Example Excerpts

[Expand to see evaluation criteria and examples]

## Deal Evaluation

**Fully Meets Expectations:**
"Applies multiple Week 2 frameworks systematically. Evaluates deal using rights valuation
drivers (audience, exclusivity, volume, brand, strategy fit), platform economics (linear
vs. streaming profitability timelines), and fan engagement monetization. Demonstrates
nuanced understanding of Rogers' strategic rationale vs. financial outcomes."

**Example Excerpt:**
"Rogers' $5.2B valuation assumed three critical drivers: (1) Hockey's enduring Canadian
audience would resist cord-cutting trends [Valuation Driver: Audience], (2) Exclusive
rights would create insurmountable competitive moat [Driver: Exclusivity], and (3)
Sportsnet NOW streaming would achieve 1M+ subscribers by Year 5 at $25/month [Platform
Economics: Subscription revenue]. All three assumptions proved overly optimistic. Actual
streaming subscribers reached only 450K (Exhibit B), advertising revenue declined 33%
due to faster-than-expected cord-cutting, and TSN's diversification strategy proved more
resilient than Rogers anticipated..."

**Partially Meets Expectations:**
"Applies Week 2 frameworks with some analysis. Evaluates deal using several relevant
concepts. May miss some nuances or fail to integrate all frameworks systematically."

**Does Not Meet Expectations:**
"Minimal or no application of Week 2 frameworks. Evaluation is purely opinion-based
without supporting analysis."

---

## Mistake Identification

**Fully Meets Expectations:**
"Identifies 2-3 specific, insightful mistakes supported by exhibit data. Goes beyond
obvious errors to reveal strategic misjudgments. Analysis is evidence-based."

**Example Excerpt:**
"Rogers made three critical mistakes: (1) **Overestimated the 'Canadian exceptionalism'
of hockey** - assumed cord-cutting would spare sports fans, but Exhibit A shows ad revenue
declined faster than U.S. trends; (2) **Failed to build differentiated engagement beyond
live games** - Sportsnet NOW was pure streaming with minimal fantasy, social, or interactive
features (contrast with DAZN's multi-sport strategy), leading to high churn; (3) **No
flexibility clause for black swan events** - COVID devastated Year 7 revenue (Exhibit A:
$200M vs. projected $550M) with no force majeure protection in the contract."

**Partially Meets Expectations:**
"Identifies 2-3 reasonable mistakes with some supporting evidence. Analysis is solid
but may lack depth or miss less obvious strategic errors."

## Element 11: AI Coach - Rogers Case Analysis Coach

### Student-Facing Text Content:
**Copy this markdown directly into Uplimit BEFORE the AI Coach:**

```markdown
## Your AI Case Analysis Coach

Feeling stuck on your memo? Not sure if your argument is strong enough? Want to test your reasoning before submitting?

Use the **Rogers Case Analysis Coach** as your thinking partner throughout this assessment. This AI coach won't write your memo for you (that would defeat the learning purpose), but it WILL help you develop stronger arguments through Socratic questioning.

### How to Use the Coach

**When to use it:**
- ✅ Testing your micro-step arguments: "Does this mistake I identified make sense?"
- ✅ Clarifying framework application: "How do I apply WLO 2.2 to Rogers' streaming strategy?"
- ✅ Structuring your reasoning: "What's the best way to organize my deal evaluation?"
- ✅ Checking evidence quality: "Is this data point strong enough to support my claim?"

**When NOT to use it:**
- ❌ Asking it to write sections: "Write my 2026 recommendation for me"
- ❌ Generating content wholesale: "What should I say about Rogers' mistakes?"

### What to Expect

The coach will respond with **probing questions** to help you think deeper:
- "What does that data point tell you about Rogers' assumptions?"
- "How does this connect to the valuation framework from Module 3?"
- "What are the underlying assumptions in your recommendation?"
- "What evidence supports that claim? What evidence contradicts it?"

### Example Interaction

**You:** "I think Rogers made a mistake by overestimating streaming subscribers."

**Coach:** "Good start! Let's strengthen that argument. What was their subscriber target? What did they actually achieve? Can you quantify the revenue impact of that gap? And critically—could this have been predicted in 2014, or was it unforeseeable?"

**Why this approach works:** The coach forces you to develop YOUR analysis, not copy someone else's. This builds critical thinking skills that will serve you throughout your MBA and career.

**Ready to start?** Open the Rogers Case Analysis Coach below and ask your first question.
