- **Improves quality**: AI feedback on micro-steps catches weak arguments early (before final submission)
- **Maintains rigor**: Final memo still requires synthesis and executive-level writing
- **UDL support**: Multiple checkpoints provide scaffolding without lowering standards

**Detailed Content Specifications:**

### Infobox Content (Element 1):
```
Title: ▪ Assessment: Rogers NHL Deal Mini-Case Memo (Scaffolded Approach)

**Your Task:**
Write a 2-page executive memo (max 1000 words) evaluating the Rogers NHL deal and providing strategic recommendations for the 2026 decision.

**How This Works (4-Step Scaffolded Process):**

To help you write a stronger memo, this assessment is broken into 3 micro-steps with AI feedback BEFORE you write your final memo:

1. **Micro-Step 1:** Identify 3 key mistakes Rogers made (3 bullets, AI feedback)
2. **Micro-Step 2:** Evaluate the deal using Week 2 frameworks (1 paragraph, AI feedback)
3. **Micro-Step 3:** Recommend Rogers' 2026 strategy (1 paragraph, AI feedback)
4. **Final Memo:** Synthesize all 3 micro-steps into polished 2-page executive memo

**Why This Approach?**
- Each micro-step earns 5 participation points (15 pts total)
- AI feedback helps you strengthen arguments BEFORE final submission
- Reduces writing anxiety by building confidence through small wins
- Final memo is worth 40 points (graded with full rubric)

**Prompt:**
You are a consultant hired by Rogers Communications in 2024 to assess the NHL deal's performance and recommend next steps.

**Requirements:**
• Complete all 3 micro-steps first (AI will provide feedback)
• Then write final 2-page memo (max 1000 words)
• Executive memo format (To/From/Date/Re)
• Apply concepts from readings, executive session, and simulation
• Reference specific data from case widgets (Widgets 6, 7, 8)
• Due: [Date] by 11:59 PM

**Total Points:** 55 points (15 micro-steps + 40 final memo)
**MLOs Assessed:** 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4

### Element 4: Micro-Step 1 - Key Mistakes (Text Response)

**Question Text:**
```
MICRO-STEP 1: Identify Rogers' Key Mistakes

List 3 specific mistakes Rogers made in the NHL deal. For each mistake, provide:
• What went wrong (1 sentence)
• Evidence from the case data (reference specific numbers from Widgets 6, 7, or 8)

Format: Use bullet points. Be specific and evidence-based.

Example:
• Mistake 1: [What went wrong]. Evidence: [Widget X shows Y data point].
• Mistake 2: [What went wrong]. Evidence: [specific number from case].
• Mistake 3: [What went wrong]. Evidence: [comparison or variance].
```

**AI Feedback Configuration:**
- ✅ Enable AI feedback
- **Feedback Prompt:** "Review this student's 3 key mistakes. For each mistake: (1) Confirm if it's evidence-based and specific, (2) Ask if they can quantify the impact (e.g., revenue shortfall, subscriber gap), (3) Suggest one deeper question they should consider. Be encouraging but push for precision. Example: 'Good start! For Mistake #2, you identified streaming underperformance. Can you quantify the subscriber gap? Widget 6 shows the exact numbers—what percentage did Rogers miss their target by?'"
- **Points:** 5 points (participation credit, not graded rigorously)
- **Purpose:** Build confidence, get students comfortable analyzing data

### Element 4: Micro-Step 2 - Deal Evaluation (Text Response)

**Question Text:**
```
MICRO-STEP 2: Evaluate the Deal

Write 1 paragraph (100-150 words) evaluating whether Rogers' $5.2B investment was justified.

Apply Week 2 frameworks:
• Media rights valuation framework (MLO 2.1): Did Rogers properly value audience size, exclusivity, platform flexibility?
• Platform economics (MLO 2.2): Did the linear TV + streaming strategy make sense?
• Fan engagement (MLO 2.3): Did Rogers effectively monetize beyond rights fees?

Was the deal justified given Rogers' strategic goals (defend cable, build Sportsnet brand, enter streaming)?
```

**AI Feedback Configuration:**
- ✅ Enable AI feedback
- **Feedback Prompt:** "Review this student's deal evaluation paragraph. Check: (1) Did they apply at least 2 Week 2 frameworks? (2) Did they distinguish between financial ROI and strategic value? (3) Is their evaluation nuanced (acknowledging both successes and failures)? Provide specific feedback. Example: 'Strong use of the valuation framework! You mentioned exclusivity as a key factor. Now, can you add the platform economics lens? How did Rogers' linear + streaming strategy compare to what you learned in the Streaming Wars simulation? Would a multi-sport approach (like DAZN) have been smarter?'"
- **Points:** 5 points (participation credit)
- **Purpose:** Ensure students apply frameworks, not just opinionate

---

---

### Element 5: Micro-Step 3 - 2026 Recommendation (Text Response)

**Question Text:**
```
MICRO-STEP 3: 2026 Strategic Recommendation

Write 1 paragraph (100-150 words) recommending what Rogers should do in 2026 when the NHL deal expires.

Choose ONE option and defend it:
• Option 1: Renew exclusive rights (at what price?)
• Option 2: Renegotiate for split package with competitors
• Option 3: Walk away entirely

Your recommendation should:
• State your chosen option clearly
• Provide 2-3 reasons with evidence
• Acknowledge the risks/trade-offs of your choice
• Reference market dynamics (competitors, streaming trends, viewership data)
```

**AI Feedback Configuration:**
- ✅ Enable AI feedback
- **Feedback Prompt:** "Review this student's 2026 recommendation. Check: (1) Is their recommendation clear and specific? (2) Did they provide evidence-based reasons? (3) Did they acknowledge risks/trade-offs? (4) Did they consider competitive landscape and market trends? Provide constructive feedback. Example: 'Clear recommendation! You chose Option 2 (split package). Strong reasons about cost reduction and risk management. Now, what's your Plan B if the NHL refuses to split rights? Also, you mentioned TSN as a potential partner—what makes that partnership viable given the competitive history? Widget 7's competitor data might help you strengthen this argument.'"
- **Points:** 5 points (participation credit)
- **Purpose:** Force students to commit to a position before final memo (builds conviction)

### Details - Rubric Examples Content:
```
Title: Rubric Details & Example Excerpts

[Expand to see evaluation criteria and examples]

## Deal Evaluation (12 points)

**Excellent (11-12 pts):**
"Applies multiple Week 2 frameworks systematically. Evaluates deal using rights valuation
drivers (audience, exclusivity, volume, brand, strategy fit), platform economics (linear
vs. streaming profitability timelines), and fan engagement monetization. Demonstrates
nuanced understanding of Rogers' strategic rationale vs. financial outcomes."

**Example Excerpt:**
"Rogers' $5.2B valuation assumed three critical drivers: (1) Hockey's enduring Canadian
audience would resist cord-cutting trends [Valuation Driver: Audience], (2) Exclusive
rights would create insurmountable competitive moat [Driver: Exclusivity], and (3)
Sportsnet NOW streaming would achieve 1M+ subscribers by Year 5 at $25/month [Platform
Economics: Subscription revenue]. All three assumptions proved overly optimistic. Actual
streaming subscribers reached only 450K (Exhibit B), advertising revenue declined 33%
due to faster-than-expected cord-cutting, and TSN's diversification strategy proved more
resilient than Rogers anticipated..."

**Proficient (9-10 pts):**
"Applies Week 2 frameworks with some analysis. Evaluates deal using several relevant
concepts. May miss some nuances or fail to integrate all frameworks systematically."

**Developing (6-8 pts):**
"References Week 2 concepts but application is superficial. Evaluation lacks depth or
specificity. May focus on one framework and ignore others."

**Needs Improvement (0-5 pts):**
"Minimal or no application of Week 2 frameworks. Evaluation is purely opinion-based
without supporting analysis."

---

## Mistake Identification (10 points)

**Excellent (9-10 pts):**
"Identifies 2-3 specific, insightful mistakes supported by exhibit data. Goes beyond
obvious errors to reveal strategic misjudgments. Analysis is evidence-based."

**Example Excerpt:**
"Rogers made three critical mistakes: (1) **Overestimated the 'Canadian exceptionalism'
of hockey** - assumed cord-cutting would spare sports fans, but Exhibit A shows ad revenue
declined faster than U.S. trends; (2) **Failed to build differentiated engagement beyond
live games** - Sportsnet NOW was pure streaming with minimal fantasy, social, or interactive
features (contrast with DAZN's multi-sport strategy), leading to high churn; (3) **No
flexibility clause for black swan events** - COVID devastated Year 7 revenue (Exhibit A:
$200M vs. projected $550M) with no force majeure protection in the contract."

**Proficient (7-8 pts):**
"Identifies 2-3 reasonable mistakes with some supporting evidence. Analysis is solid
but may lack depth or miss less obvious strategic errors."

## 🎯 FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION

**How Module 6 Supports Your Final Strategic Vision:**

Module 6's Mini-Case Memo is practice for your Week 5 capstone assessment. You've now written an executive-level strategic analysis synthesizing Week 2 frameworks.

**What You Learned:**
- How to evaluate billion-dollar deals using multiple frameworks (rights valuation, platform economics, engagement, strategic fit)
- How to identify strategic mistakes with evidence (not opinions)
- How to recommend next steps with explicit trade-off analysis
- How to write concisely for executive audiences (500-750 words)

**How to Apply This to Your Final Project:**

When you write your 5-year strategic vision in Week 5, Module 6's memo structure becomes your template:

- **Analytical Rigor:** Your capstone requires the same evidence-based analysis you practiced here. Every claim needs data/framework support: "Rogers' mistake was X (evidence: Exhibit A shows Y variance). Our property avoids this by Z strategy."
- **Trade-Off Clarity:** Module 6 forced you to weigh renew vs. renegotiate vs. exit. Week 5 will require similar decision frameworks: build vs. license, DTC vs. linear, exclusive vs. non-exclusive.
- **Executive Communication:** The memo format you practiced—situation analysis → evaluation → recommendation → rationale—is exactly what your Week 5 capstone requires. Scale it from 750 words to 2,000 words.
- **Peer + AI Review:** You used AI feedback and peer review in Module 6. Apply the same iterative improvement process to your Week 5 capstone.

**Real-World Application:** The Mini-Case Memo you wrote mirrors the strategy documents executives submit to boards for multi-million dollar decisions. Your Week 5 capstone scales this skill to a comprehensive 5-year vision.
