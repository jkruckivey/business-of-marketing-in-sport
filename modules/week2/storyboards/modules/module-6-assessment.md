## Element 3: AI Roleplay - Rogers Board Practice Pitch

**Scenario Title:** "Rogers Board Strategy Session"

**Purpose:** Formative practice where students rehearse their analysis before writing.

### Uplimit Configuration

**Scenario Context:**
```
You are a strategy consultant hired by Rogers Communications. The board is meeting to review the NHL deal's performance and decide what to do when rights expire in 2026. CEO Marcus Thompson wants to hear your analysis before the full board presentation.

This roleplay is formative practice (not graded) to help you rehearse before writing your final memo.
```

**AI Role:**
```
You are Marcus Thompson, CEO of Rogers Communications, meeting with a strategy consultant about the NHL rights deal. You're frustrated that the $5.2B investment never achieved projected returns, but you need objective analysis—not finger-pointing.

Conversation flow:
1. Ask them to explain where the deal went wrong
2. Probe for specifics (which assumptions failed? by how much?)
3. Ask about the streaming vs. linear trade-offs
4. Request their 2026 recommendation with clear reasoning
5. Challenge their recommendation with a counter-argument

Be direct but professional. After 5-6 exchanges, wrap up: "Good analysis. I want this in memo format for the board by end of week."
```

**Student Instructions:**
```
You are a strategy consultant presenting to Rogers CEO Marcus Thompson about the NHL deal. He wants honest analysis of what went wrong and a recommendation for 2026.

This is practice—use it to test your arguments before writing your memo.
```

## Instructor Notes

**Module 6 Purpose:**
- Assess Week 2 learning through authentic executive communication task
- AI Roleplay provides formative practice before summative assessment
- Clean handoff to Module 7 (milestone submission)

**Scaffolded Approach (Optional):**
If you want to provide additional scaffolding for writing-anxious students, you can break the memo into 3 micro-steps with AI feedback:
1. Micro-Step 1: Identify 3 key mistakes (bullets)
2. Micro-Step 2: Evaluate deal using frameworks (1 paragraph)
3. Micro-Step 3: 2026 recommendation (1 paragraph)
Then synthesize into final memo.

**AI Grading Prompt:**
```
Evaluate this Rogers NHL Deal memo against these criteria:
1. DEAL EVALUATION: Applies Week 2 frameworks (valuation, platform economics, engagement) with evidence
2. MISTAKE IDENTIFICATION: 2-3 specific mistakes with supporting exhibit data
3. STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS: Actionable 2026 strategy with trade-off analysis
4. BUSINESS COMMUNICATION: Professional memo format, clear writing, within word limit

Be encouraging but specific. Highlight what they did well and suggest 1-2 areas for improvement.
```

**Grading Notes:**
- Focus on framework application (valuation drivers, platform economics), not just listing mistakes
- Recommendations should acknowledge trade-offs and competitive landscape
- Evidence from case exhibits demonstrates engagement with course content
