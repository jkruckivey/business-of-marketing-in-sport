**Scaffolding Rationale:**
- **Reduces writing anxiety**: Students build confidence through small wins before tackling full memo
- **Improves quality**: AI feedback on micro-steps catches weak arguments early (before final submission)
- **Maintains rigor**: Final memo still requires synthesis and executive-level writing
- **UDL support**: Multiple checkpoints provide scaffolding without lowering standards

**Detailed Content Specifications:**

### Infobox Content (Element 1):
```
Title: ▪ Assessment: Rogers NHL Deal Mini-Case Memo (Scaffolded Approach)

**Your Task:**
Write a 2-page executive memo (max 1000 words) evaluating the Rogers NHL deal and providing strategic recommendations for the 2026 decision.

**How This Works (4-Step Scaffolded Process):**

To help you write a stronger memo, this assessment is broken into 3 micro-steps with AI feedback BEFORE you write your final memo:

1. **Micro-Step 1:** Identify 3 key mistakes Rogers made (3 bullets, AI feedback)
2. **Micro-Step 2:** Evaluate the deal using Week 2 frameworks (1 paragraph, AI feedback)
3. **Micro-Step 3:** Recommend Rogers' 2026 strategy (1 paragraph, AI feedback)
4. **Final Memo:** Synthesize all 3 micro-steps into polished 2-page executive memo

**Why This Approach?**
- Each micro-step earns 5 participation points (15 pts total)
- AI feedback helps you strengthen arguments BEFORE final submission
- Reduces writing anxiety by building confidence through small wins
- Final memo is worth 40 points (graded with full rubric)

**Prompt:**
You are a consultant hired by Rogers Communications in 2024 to assess the NHL deal's performance and recommend next steps.

**Requirements:**
• Complete all 3 micro-steps first (AI will provide feedback)
• Then write final 2-page memo (max 1000 words)
• Executive memo format (To/From/Date/Re)
• Apply concepts from readings, executive session, and simulation
• Reference specific data from case widgets (Widgets 6, 7, 8)
• Due: [Date] by 11:59 PM

**Total Points:** 60 points (15 micro-steps + 40 final memo + 5 PAIRR bonus)

**Optional PAIRR Bonus (5 points):**
- Peer feedback (2 pts) + AI feedback (1 pt) + Comparative reflection (1 pt) + Post-revision reflection (1 pt)
- Due: Phases 2-3 by Day 5, Phase 5 by Day 7

**MLOs Assessed:** 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4

## Element 4: **RENUMBERED** - Micro-Step 1 - Key Mistakes (Text Response) (was Element 3)

**Question Text:**
```
MICRO-STEP 1: Identify Rogers' Key Mistakes

List 3 specific mistakes Rogers made in the NHL deal. For each mistake, provide:
• What went wrong (1 sentence)
• Evidence from the case data (reference specific numbers from Widgets 6, 7, or 8)

Format: Use bullet points. Be specific and evidence-based.

Example:
• Mistake 1: [What went wrong]. Evidence: [Widget X shows Y data point].
• Mistake 2: [What went wrong]. Evidence: [specific number from case].
• Mistake 3: [What went wrong]. Evidence: [comparison or variance].
```

**AI Feedback Configuration:**
- ✅ Enable AI feedback
- **Feedback Prompt:** "Review this student's 3 key mistakes. For each mistake: (1) Confirm if it's evidence-based and specific, (2) Ask if they can quantify the impact (e.g., revenue shortfall, subscriber gap), (3) Suggest one deeper question they should consider. Be encouraging but push for precision. Example: 'Good start! For Mistake #2, you identified streaming underperformance. Can you quantify the subscriber gap? Widget 6 shows the exact numbers—what percentage did Rogers miss their target by?'"
- **Points:** 5 points (participation credit, not graded rigorously)
- **Purpose:** Build confidence, get students comfortable analyzing data

---

## Element 5: **RENUMBERED** - Micro-Step 2 - Deal Evaluation (Text Response) (was Element 4)

**Question Text:**
```
MICRO-STEP 2: Evaluate the Deal

Write 1 paragraph (100-150 words) evaluating whether Rogers' $5.2B investment was justified.

Apply Week 2 frameworks:
• Media rights valuation framework (MLO 2.1): Did Rogers properly value audience size, exclusivity, platform flexibility?
• Platform economics (MLO 2.2): Did the linear TV + streaming strategy make sense?
• Fan engagement (MLO 2.3): Did Rogers effectively monetize beyond rights fees?

Was the deal justified given Rogers' strategic goals (defend cable, build Sportsnet brand, enter streaming)?
```

**AI Feedback Configuration:**
- ✅ Enable AI feedback
- **Feedback Prompt:** "Review this student's deal evaluation paragraph. Check: (1) Did they apply at least 2 Week 2 frameworks? (2) Did they distinguish between financial ROI and strategic value? (3) Is their evaluation nuanced (acknowledging both successes and failures)? Provide specific feedback. Example: 'Strong use of the valuation framework! You mentioned exclusivity as a key factor. Now, can you add the platform economics lens? How did Rogers' linear + streaming strategy compare to what you learned in the Streaming Wars simulation? Would a multi-sport approach (like DAZN) have been smarter?'"
- **Points:** 5 points (participation credit)
- **Purpose:** Ensure students apply frameworks, not just opinionate

---

## Element 6: **RENUMBERED** - Micro-Step 3 - 2026 Recommendation (Text Response) (was Element 5)

**Question Text:**
```
MICRO-STEP 3: 2026 Strategic Recommendation

Write 1 paragraph (100-150 words) recommending what Rogers should do in 2026 when the NHL deal expires.

Choose ONE option and defend it:
• Option 1: Renew exclusive rights (at what price?)
• Option 2: Renegotiate for split package with competitors
• Option 3: Walk away entirely

Your recommendation should:
• State your chosen option clearly
• Provide 2-3 reasons with evidence
• Acknowledge the risks/trade-offs of your choice
• Reference market dynamics (competitors, streaming trends, viewership data)
```

**AI Feedback Configuration:**
- ✅ Enable AI feedback
- **Feedback Prompt:** "Review this student's 2026 recommendation. Check: (1) Is their recommendation clear and specific? (2) Did they provide evidence-based reasons? (3) Did they acknowledge risks/trade-offs? (4) Did they consider competitive landscape and market trends? Provide constructive feedback. Example: 'Clear recommendation! You chose Option 2 (split package). Strong reasons about cost reduction and risk management. Now, what's your Plan B if the NHL refuses to split rights? Also, you mentioned TSN as a potential partner—what makes that partnership viable given the competitive history? Widget 7's competitor data might help you strengthen this argument.'"
- **Points:** 5 points (participation credit)
- **Purpose:** Force students to commit to a position before final memo (builds conviction)

```markdown
# Phase 2A: Peer Feedback Instructions (2 Points Bonus)

After completing your draft memo, you'll review a classmate's draft.

## How to Provide Effective Peer Feedback:

### Step 1: Read the Draft (10 minutes)
- Read your classmate's complete draft memo
- Note strengths and areas for improvement
- Refer to the 40-point rubric (Element 18) for grading criteria

### Step 2: Evaluate Using Rubric (15 minutes)

**Deal Evaluation (12 points)**
- Does the memo apply Week 2 frameworks (rights valuation, platform economics, fan engagement)?
- Is the analysis supported by specific evidence from case data?
- Does it demonstrate nuanced understanding of Rogers' strategic rationale vs. financial outcomes?
- **Feedback:** What's strong? What needs more framework application or data support?

**Mistake Identification (10 points)**
- Are 2-3 specific mistakes identified with supporting evidence from exhibits?
- Does the analysis go beyond obvious errors to reveal strategic misjudgments?
- **Feedback:** What's strong? What needs more specificity or evidence?

**Strategic Recommendations (10 points)**
- Is the 2026 recommendation specific and actionable?
- Are recommendations defensible with evidence and market analysis?
- Are trade-offs and risks acknowledged?
- **Feedback:** What's strong? What's missing from the strategy?

**Application of Concepts (5 points)**
- Does the memo apply concepts from readings, executive session, and simulation?
- Are relevant connections made demonstrating integrated learning?
- **Feedback:** What's strong? Where could connections be strengthened?

**Business Communication (3 points)**
- Professional memo format? Clear writing? Within 1000 words?
- **Feedback:** What's strong? Any clarity issues?

### Step 3: Write Constructive Feedback (10 minutes)

Provide 400-600 word feedback addressing:
1. **What's Working Well:** 2-3 specific strengths
2. **What Needs Improvement:** 3-4 specific weaknesses with suggestions
3. **Priority Revision:** If limited time, what's the ONE most important fix?

**Example Feedback:**
"Strong application of platform economics framework in your deal evaluation! You clearly explained why Rogers' linear + streaming strategy struggled. For improvement: Your mistake identification could be more specific. Instead of 'Rogers overestimated streaming,' reference the exact subscriber gap from Widget 6 (projected 1M vs. actual 450K = 55% shortfall). This quantification strengthens your argument significantly."

### Step 4: Submit Peer Feedback

Submit via peer feedback submission box (Element 11) by Day 5.

**Grading:** 2 points bonus for completing thorough peer review.

# Phase 3: Comparative Reflection (1 Point Bonus)

Now that you've received both peer feedback and AI feedback, compare them.

## Reflection Prompt:

Write 300-400 words comparing the peer feedback you received vs. the AI feedback you generated. Address:

### 1. Quality Comparison (150-200 words)
- Which feedback was more specific? More actionable?
- Did peer feedback catch anything AI missed (or vice versa)?
- Which feedback better understood the context of the Rogers case?
- Were there contradictions between peer and AI feedback? If so, which did you trust more and why?

### 2. Usefulness for Revision (100-150 words)
- Which feedback will most influence your revision? Why?
- Did one source identify a "priority fix" you hadn't considered?
- Were there suggestions you plan to ignore? Why?

### 3. AI Literacy Insight (50 words)
- What did this exercise teach you about AI's strengths and limitations for strategic analysis?

**Example Excerpt:**
"My peer reviewer provided more context-specific feedback, noting that my 2026 recommendation didn't address TSN's competitive response (something only someone familiar with Canadian sports media would catch). However, the AI feedback was more systematic in checking rubric alignment—it caught that I completely missed discussing fan engagement monetization in my deal evaluation. The contradiction was interesting: my peer said my mistake identification was 'strong,' while AI said it 'lacked specificity and exhibit references.' Reviewing my draft again, AI was right—I made general claims without citing Widget 6 data. For revision, I'll prioritize AI's specificity suggestion (add exhibit numbers) and peer's strategic insight (address competitive dynamics)..."

2. Copy markdown below:

```markdown
# Phase 5: Post-Revision Reflection (1 Point Bonus)

After submitting your final revised memo, reflect on your revision process.

## Reflection Prompt:

Write 200-300 words reflecting on which feedback most influenced your final revision. Address:

### 1. Revision Choices (150-200 words)
- Which specific feedback did you incorporate? (Reference peer or AI by name/type)
- What changes did you make to your memo based on feedback?
- Was there feedback you chose NOT to incorporate? Why?
- Did you make any revisions that weren't suggested by either peer or AI?

### 2. Learning About Feedback (50-100 words)
- What did this process teach you about using feedback effectively?
- Will you approach peer review or AI tools differently in future assignments?

**Example Excerpt:**
"I incorporated 4 major revisions: (1) Added specific exhibit references to all mistake claims [AI feedback], (2) Expanded platform economics analysis to compare Rogers' strategy vs. DAZN multi-sport approach [peer feedback], (3) Addressed TSN competitive response in my 2026 recommendation [peer feedback], (4) Cut 200 words of fluff to stay under word limit [AI feedback]. I chose NOT to incorporate peer's suggestion to recommend 'walk away entirely' for 2026—while I appreciated the boldness, the case evidence doesn't support abandoning NHL rights given Sportsnet's brand identity. I also made one revision neither source suggested: I added a risk mitigation table for my split-package recommendation, inspired by the Streaming Wars simulation format. This process taught me that AI is better at systematic rubric checking while peers catch strategic nuances. Going forward, I'll use AI first for completeness checks, then peer review for strategic soundness..."

## Element 18: **RENUMBERED** - Details - Rubric Examples (was Element 8)
```
Title: Rubric Details & Example Excerpts

[Expand to see evaluation criteria and examples]

## Deal Evaluation (12 points)

**Excellent (11-12 pts):**
"Applies multiple Week 2 frameworks systematically. Evaluates deal using rights valuation
drivers (audience, exclusivity, volume, brand, strategy fit), platform economics (linear
vs. streaming profitability timelines), and fan engagement monetization. Demonstrates
nuanced understanding of Rogers' strategic rationale vs. financial outcomes."

**Example Excerpt:**
"Rogers' $5.2B valuation assumed three critical drivers: (1) Hockey's enduring Canadian
audience would resist cord-cutting trends [Valuation Driver: Audience], (2) Exclusive
rights would create insurmountable competitive moat [Driver: Exclusivity], and (3)
Sportsnet NOW streaming would achieve 1M+ subscribers by Year 5 at $25/month [Platform
Economics: Subscription revenue]. All three assumptions proved overly optimistic. Actual
streaming subscribers reached only 450K (Exhibit B), advertising revenue declined 33%
due to faster-than-expected cord-cutting, and TSN's diversification strategy proved more
resilient than Rogers anticipated..."

**Proficient (9-10 pts):**
"Applies Week 2 frameworks with some analysis. Evaluates deal using several relevant
concepts. May miss some nuances or fail to integrate all frameworks systematically."

**Developing (6-8 pts):**
"References Week 2 concepts but application is superficial. Evaluation lacks depth or
specificity. May focus on one framework and ignore others."

**Needs Improvement (0-5 pts):**
"Minimal or no application of Week 2 frameworks. Evaluation is purely opinion-based
without supporting analysis."

---

## Mistake Identification (10 points)

**Excellent (9-10 pts):**
"Identifies 2-3 specific, insightful mistakes supported by exhibit data. Goes beyond
obvious errors to reveal strategic misjudgments. Analysis is evidence-based."

**Example Excerpt:**
"Rogers made three critical mistakes: (1) **Overestimated the 'Canadian exceptionalism'
of hockey** - assumed cord-cutting would spare sports fans, but Exhibit A shows ad revenue
declined faster than U.S. trends; (2) **Failed to build differentiated engagement beyond
live games** - Sportsnet NOW was pure streaming with minimal fantasy, social, or interactive
features (contrast with DAZN's multi-sport strategy), leading to high churn; (3) **No
flexibility clause for black swan events** - COVID devastated Year 7 revenue (Exhibit A:
$200M vs. projected $550M) with no force majeure protection in the contract."

**Proficient (7-8 pts):**
"Identifies 2-3 reasonable mistakes with some supporting evidence. Analysis is solid
but may lack depth or miss less obvious strategic errors."

## Element 19: **RENUMBERED** - AI Chat Widget Configuration (was Element 9)
- **Widget Name:** "Rogers Case Analysis Coach"
- **System Prompt:** "You are a helpful case analysis coach for MBA students. Provide guidance on analyzing the Rogers NHL case study. Do NOT write content for students. Instead, ask probing questions to help them think critically: What does this data point tell you? How does this connect to the frameworks from readings? What are the underlying assumptions? Focus on: case analysis methodology, framework application, evidence-based reasoning, and strategic thinking. If students ask you to write their memo, redirect them to develop their own analysis with your guidance."
- **Welcome Message:** "Hi! I'm here to coach you through your Rogers case analysis. I won't write your memo, but I'll ask questions to help you develop stronger arguments. What aspect of the case are you working on?"
- **Show System Prompt:** No

**Design Rationale:**
- **Text Response with rubric** measures analytical and evaluative thinking (Bloom's Analysis/Evaluation)
- **Infobox** provides crystal-clear instructions and expectations (QM Standard 3)
- **Rubric** ensures transparent, consistent evaluation (QM Standard 3, UDL clarity)
- **AI grading** enables timely feedback at scale with quality maintenance
- **Details** makes rubric fully transparent with examples (students know exactly what excellence looks like)
- **AI Chat Coach** serves as your thinking partner during case analysis—use it to test your arguments, clarify framework application, or structure your reasoning (UDL scaffolding + active learning)
- Authentic consulting task (executive memo format) mirrors real-world practice
- Word limit ensures concision and prioritization (executive communication skill)
- Measures all 4 MLOs comprehensively in integrated assessment

## 🎯 FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION

**How Module 6 Supports Your Final Strategic Vision:**

Module 6's Mini-Case Memo is practice for your Week 5 capstone assessment. You've now written an executive-level strategic analysis synthesizing Week 2 frameworks.

**What You Learned:**
- How to evaluate billion-dollar deals using multiple frameworks (rights valuation, platform economics, engagement, strategic fit)
- How to identify strategic mistakes with evidence (not opinions)
- How to recommend next steps with explicit trade-off analysis
- How to write concisely for executive audiences (500-750 words)

**How to Apply This to Your Final Project:**

When you write your 5-year strategic vision in Week 5, Module 6's memo structure becomes your template:

- **Analytical Rigor:** Your capstone requires the same evidence-based analysis you practiced here. Every claim needs data/framework support: "Rogers' mistake was X (evidence: Exhibit A shows Y variance). Our property avoids this by Z strategy."
- **Trade-Off Clarity:** Module 6 forced you to weigh renew vs. renegotiate vs. exit. Week 5 will require similar decision frameworks: build vs. license, DTC vs. linear, exclusive vs. non-exclusive.
- **Executive Communication:** The memo format you practiced—situation analysis → evaluation → recommendation → rationale—is exactly what your Week 5 capstone requires. Scale it from 750 words to 2,000 words.
- **Peer + AI Review:** You used AI feedback and peer review in Module 6. Apply the same iterative improvement process to your Week 5 capstone.

**Real-World Application:** The Mini-Case Memo you wrote mirrors the strategy documents executives submit to boards for multi-million dollar decisions. Your Week 5 capstone scales this skill to a comprehensive 5-year vision.
