## Element 1: Connecting Introduction

You've just completed the Rogers NHL Mini-Case Memo (Module 6), analyzing a billion-dollar media rights deal and practicing strategic recommendations. You used peer and AI feedback through the PAIRR methodology to refine your analysis—a process that mirrors real executive decision-making.

Now it's time to wrap up Week 2 and apply your media strategy expertise to your Anchor Project. Module 7 consolidates your learning across all six modules, launches your team formation process, and previews Week 3's focus on sponsorship and betting. You'll also reflect on your Week 2 journey and select the sport property that will be the focus of your final capstone project.

---

## Element 2: Week 2 Key Takeaways & Journey Recap

### Your Week 2 Journey:

Let's look back at what you've accomplished across all seven modules:

- **Module 0 (Bridge):** Explored the Rogers NHL mega-deal announcement and set context
- **Module 1 (Welcome):** Established 4 learning outcomes focused on media rights and fan monetization
- **Module 2 (Executive):** Heard from a TSN/DAZN leader on rights valuation trade-offs and platform economics
- **Module 3 (Framework):** Explored media valuation frameworks and platform economics through readings
- **Module 4 (Interactive):** Simulated streaming wars and made strategic media strategy decisions
- **Module 5 (Case Study):** Deep-dived into the Rogers $5.2B NHL deal with case analysis and retrospective
- **Module 6 (Assessment):** Wrote a strategic mini-case memo with PAIRR feedback (peer + AI)
- **Module 7 (Wrap-Up):** Now! Team formation, property selection, Week 3 preview

### Infobox Content:
```
Title: ◉ Week 2 Key Takeaways

You've completed your deep dive into media rights and fan monetization! Here's what
you should take away:

✓ Sports remain "appointment viewing" in an on-demand world—this drives premium valuations
✓ Streaming economics differ fundamentally from linear TV (LTV vs. immediate ROI)
✓ Fan engagement monetization extends beyond passive viewing (data, sponsorship, retention)
✓ Mega-deals like Rogers/NHL require scenario planning and flexibility—disruption happens

This foundation prepares you for Week 3, where we'll explore the fastest-growing revenue
streams: sponsorship activation and sports betting integration.

Plus: This week you'll form your Anchor Project team and select your sport property!

Well done! 👏
```

### Week 2 Reflection

Take 5-10 minutes to reflect on your Week 2 learning:

**1. Strategic Insight:** What surprised you most about media rights economics? How did the Rogers/NHL case challenge your assumptions about billion-dollar deals?

**2. Application Readiness:** How confident do you feel analyzing media strategies for your Anchor Project property? What concepts from Week 2 need reinforcement?

**3. Professional Growth:** How will Week 2's media frameworks change how you evaluate sports business decisions in your career?

**4. Connection to Week 3:** How do you expect media strategy to interact with sponsorship and betting (Week 3's focus)?

## Element 3: Anchor Project Milestone 1 - Team Formation & Property Selection

### Text Content - Anchor Project Milestone 1:
```
## ◉ Anchor Project: Team Formation & Property Selection

Welcome to the **Anchor Project** - your 60% final assessment for this course!

Over the next 4 weeks, your team will develop a comprehensive marketing plan for a
sport organization. This week (Week 2), you'll form your team and choose your property.

**What You'll Accomplish This Week:**

### Step 1: Form Your Team (5-6 students)
Use the **Team Charter Builder** tool below to:
• Introduce yourselves (background, interests, strengths)
• Define roles (Project Manager, Research Lead, Financial Analyst, Creative Lead, etc.)
• Establish communication norms (meeting frequency, response times, tools)
• Create conflict resolution process

### Step 2: Select Your Sport Property
Use the **Property Selection Tool** below to explore 19 curated options:

**Legacy Properties:** Established teams/leagues (e.g., Toronto FC, Vancouver Whitecaps, Rugby Canada)
**Emerging Sports:** High-growth opportunities (e.g., Canadian Premier League, National Lacrosse League)
**Major Events:** One-time or recurring events (e.g., 2026 FIFA World Cup - Toronto/Vancouver)

Your team should choose a property that:
• Is interesting and marketable
• Presents clear business challenges (revenue growth, fan engagement, market expansion)
• Has accessible public information (financial data, attendance, media presence)

### Step 3: Write Your 1-Page Project Proposal
**Due: End of Week 2**

Include:
• Team roster with roles
• Chosen sport property
• 250-word rationale: Why is this property interesting? What marketing challenges does it face?

**Deliverable:** Upload PDF to [submission portal]

**Grading:** This milestone is worth 10 points (of 60 total project points). Evaluated
on team composition, property selection defensibility, and articulated challenges.

# Step 2: Choose Your Sport Property

Your team is formed—now it's time to select the sport property you'll analyze for the Anchor Project. This decision shapes your entire semester, so choose wisely!

## Why This Matters

The property you select determines:
- **Complexity of analysis**: Established teams have abundant data; emerging properties require more inference
- **Marketing challenges**: Some properties face sponsorship saturation, others struggle with awareness
- **Team interest**: You'll spend 20+ hours on this property—choose something you're passionate about

## Using the Property Selection Tool

The interactive tool below helps you explore **19 curated Canadian sport properties** across three categories:

**Legacy Properties** - Established teams with long histories (e.g., Toronto FC, Vancouver Whitecaps)
- ✅ **Advantages**: Rich data, multiple revenue streams, clear market position
- ⚠️ **Challenges**: Mature markets, limited growth headroom, heavy competition

**Emerging Sports** - High-growth opportunities (e.g., Canadian Premier League, National Lacrosse League)
- ✅ **Advantages**: Untapped markets, innovation opportunities, entrepreneurial spirit
- ⚠️ **Challenges**: Limited financial data, uncertain trajectories, smaller budgets

**Major Events** - One-time or recurring spectacles (e.g., 2026 FIFA World Cup - Toronto/Vancouver)
- ✅ **Advantages**: Massive scale, global visibility, legacy planning challenges
- ⚠️ **Challenges**: Time-limited, different dynamics than year-round properties

## How It Works

1. **Filter by Category, Market Size, Revenue Tier** - Narrow your options based on team interests
2. **Explore Property Cards** - Each card shows: Name, league, market, revenue estimate, key marketing challenges
3. **Compare Properties** - Select up to 3 properties for side-by-side comparison
4. **Export Shortlist** - Download your top 3-5 options as PDF for team discussion

## Strategic Considerations

Before choosing, discuss as a team:
- **Data availability**: Can you find financial reports, attendance data, sponsorship lists?
- **Scope appropriateness**: Is it manageable in 4 weeks but substantial enough for an MBA-level analysis?
- **Marketing challenges**: Does it present interesting problems (not just "spend more on social media")?
- **Team expertise**: Does anyone have knowledge of this sport/league that could add depth?

**Time:** 15-20 minutes to explore, discuss, and select your property
```

## Element 5: Team Charter Builder (Interactive Widget)

### Student-Facing Text Content:

```markdown
# Step 1: Build Your Team Charter

Before diving into the Anchor Project, your team needs a foundation: clear roles, communication norms, and conflict resolution processes. Research shows teams with explicit agreements outperform those without by 40%.

## Why Team Charters Matter

Group projects fail for predictable reasons:
- ❌ **Unclear roles**: "I thought YOU were doing that..."
- ❌ **Unequal workload**: 2 people do 80% of the work
- ❌ **Communication breakdowns**: Missed deadlines because someone didn't check Slack
- ❌ **Unresolved conflicts**: Tension festers until it's too late to fix

A Team Charter prevents these issues by establishing agreements **before** problems arise.

## What You'll Create

The Team Charter Builder guides you through **4 essential sections**:

### Section 1: Team Roster
- Names, roles, strengths, contact information
- **Roles to assign**: Project Manager (coordinates timelines), Research Lead (gathers data), Financial Analyst (numbers/projections), Creative Lead (presentation design), Editor (polishes deliverables)
- **Tip**: Match roles to individual strengths, not just "who volunteers first"

### Section 2: Communication Norms
- Meeting frequency (weekly? bi-weekly? synchronous or async?)
- Communication tools (Slack, Teams, email, text?)
- Response time expectations (24 hours? 48 hours?)
- **Tip**: Over-communicate availability—share schedules, exam periods, work commitments upfront

### Section 3: Working Guidelines
- Decision-making process (consensus? majority vote? PM has tiebreaker?)
- Work distribution approach (divide-and-conquer? collaborative drafting?)
- Accountability mechanisms (how do we handle missed deadlines?)
- **Tip**: Agree on "minimum viable participation" (e.g., everyone attends 80% of meetings, completes assigned tasks on time)

### Section 4: Conflict Resolution
- Escalation steps (direct conversation → full team meeting → instructor mediation)
- Ground rules for disagreements (assume good intent, focus on ideas not people, no ghosting)
- **Tip**: Name conflicts early and small before they become big and personal

## How It Works

1. **Complete Each Section** - The widget provides prompts and examples for each charter component
2. **Discuss as Team** - Use the widget to facilitate conversation (project on screen during first team meeting)
3. **Export as PDF** - Save your completed charter and share with all team members
4. **Email Reminders** - Optionally send charter to everyone's inbox for future reference

## After Completing Your Charter

- **Submit your charter** as part of your Week 2 Anchor Project deliverable
- **Refer back to it** throughout the project when questions arise ("What did we agree about deadlines?")
- **Update if needed** - Charters aren't rigid; adjust if team dynamics change

**Ready to build your team's foundation?** Use the Team Charter Builder below to establish your working agreements. Spend 20-25 minutes on this—it's an investment that will save hours of conflict later.

## Element 7: Anchor Project FAQs (Optional Guidance)

### Details Content - Anchor Project FAQs:
```
Title: ◆ Anchor Project FAQs

[Expand for answers to common questions]

**Q: How many team members should we have?**
A: 5-6 students is ideal. Fewer than 5 makes workload challenging; more than 6 creates
coordination overhead.

**Q: Can we choose a property not on the list?**
A: Yes, with instructor approval. Your property must: (1) Have sufficient public data
available, (2) Present clear marketing challenges, (3) Be a professional or semi-pro
organization (not amateur/recreational). Submit your proposal for approval.

**Q: What if our chosen property is also chosen by another team?**
A: That's fine! Different teams will develop different strategies for the same property.
This mirrors real consulting competitions.

**Q: How much time should we invest in the Anchor Project each week?**
A: Week 2: 2-3 hours (team formation, property selection)
   Week 3: 2-3 hours (revenue model development)
   Week 4: 3-4 hours (brand strategy, competitive analysis)
   Week 5: 4-6 hours (final presentation preparation)

**Q: What if a team member isn't contributing?**
A: Your Team Charter should include accountability mechanisms. If issues persist, use
your conflict resolution process. As a last resort, contact the instructor. Peer
evaluations in Week 5 will account for individual contributions.

**Q: Can we interview executives at our chosen property?**
A: Absolutely! Original research strengthens your project. If you conduct interviews,
include key insights and quotes in your final presentation.

**Q: What resources are available beyond the tools?**
A: Each week provides readings, frameworks, and templates. Use office hours for team
check-ins. The AI chat assistants can help with specific questions. Discussion forums
are great for crowdsourcing ideas from other teams.

## Element 9: Final Project Connection

## 🎯 FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION

**How Week 2 Supports Your Final Strategic Vision:**

Week 2 taught you how to evaluate and design media rights strategies—the largest revenue stream (40-60%) for most sports properties. This expertise is central to your Week 5 capstone.

**What You Mastered:**
- Media rights valuation frameworks (audience × demographics × exclusivity × platform reach)
- Platform economics (linear advertising vs. streaming subscription models)
- Deal structure and negotiation (term, exclusivity, revenue models, flexibility clauses)
- Performance evaluation (projected vs. actual analysis, mistake identification, strategic pivots)

**How to Apply This to Your Final Project:**

Your Week 5 strategic vision must integrate Week 2's media frameworks comprehensively:

- **Media Rights Section (likely 30-40% of your capstone):** This is your property's largest revenue stream. Use Week 2's valuation tools, platform comparison frameworks, and deal structure templates to design a sophisticated 5-year media strategy.
- **Integration with Other Weeks:** Media strategy connects to everything: Week 1 (ecosystem effects), Week 3 (sponsorship amplification through media), Week 4 (athlete brand exposure via media), Week 5 (heritage vs. innovation in media approach).
- **Real Numbers:** Your vision needs quantitative projections. Use Week 2's widgets and case data to benchmark realistic media rights valuations for your property.

**Integration Across All Weeks:**
- Week 1 = Revenue ecosystem foundation
- **Week 2 = Media rights specialization (40-60% of revenue)**
- Week 3 = Sponsorship/betting specialization
- Week 4 = Athlete brand specialization
- Week 5 = Synthesis into 5-year vision

**Real-World Application:** Media strategy is the foundation of modern sports economics. Your Week 5 capstone must demonstrate mastery of this domain—Week 2 provided the technical toolkit.
