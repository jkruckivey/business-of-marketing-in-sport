## Element 1: Connecting Introduction

You've just completed the Rogers NHL Mini-Case Memo, analyzing a billion-dollar media rights deal and practicing strategic recommendations. You used a scaffolded approach with AI feedback to refine your analysis—a process that mirrors real executive decision-making.

Now it's time to wrap up Week 2 and apply your media strategy expertise to your CFL Expansion Project. This module consolidates your learning across the entire week and previews Week 3's focus on sponsorship and betting. You'll also reflect on your Week 2 journey and select the sport property that will be the focus of your final capstone project.

---

## Element 2: Week 2 Key Takeaways & Journey Recap

### Your Week 2 Journey:

Let's look back at what you've accomplished across all seven modules:

- **The $5.2 Billion Question (Bridge):** Explored the Rogers NHL mega-deal announcement and set context
- **Your Week 2 Journey:** Established 4 learning outcomes focused on media rights and fan monetization
- **Inside the Media Business:** Heard from a TSN/DAZN leader on rights valuation trade-offs and platform economics
- **Media Rights Frameworks:** Explored media valuation frameworks and platform economics through readings
- **Streaming Wars Simulation:** Simulated streaming wars and made strategic media strategy decisions
- **The Rogers Challenge:** Deep-dived into the Rogers $5.2B NHL deal with case analysis and retrospective
- **Your Mini-Case Memo:** Wrote a strategic mini-case memo with scaffolded micro-steps and AI feedback
- **Looking Ahead (Now!):** Property selection, Week 3 preview

### Infobox Content:
```
Title: ◉ Week 2 Key Takeaways

You've completed your deep dive into media rights and fan monetization! Here's what
you should take away:

✓ Sports remain "appointment viewing" in an on-demand world—this drives premium valuations
✓ Streaming economics differ fundamentally from linear TV (LTV vs. immediate ROI)
✓ Fan engagement monetization moves viewers through the value chain (passive → engaged → super-fan)
✓ Dynamic pricing (Al Dak's "checking account to portfolio management") applies across media inventory
✓ Mega-deals like Rogers/NHL require scenario planning and flexibility—disruption happens
✓ The scaffolded assessment approach with AI feedback develops strategic thinking AND AI literacy skills

This foundation prepares you for Week 3, where we'll explore the fastest-growing revenue
streams: sponsorship activation and sports betting integration.

Plus: This week you'll select your sport property for the Anchor Project!

Well done! 👏

## Element 3: Anchor Project Milestone 1 - City Selection

### Text Content - Anchor Project Milestone 1:
```
## ◉ CFL Expansion Project: City Selection

Welcome to the **CFL Expansion Project** - your Anchor Project for this course!

Over the next 4 weeks, you'll develop a comprehensive expansion proposal for a new CFL franchise. This week, you'll choose your expansion city.

**What You'll Accomplish This Week:**

### Select Your Expansion City
Use the **CFL City Selector** below to explore 6 potential Canadian markets:

**High Viability:** Halifax (Atlantic market), Quebec City (French-Canadian hub)
**Medium Viability:** London ON (Ontario corridor), Victoria (BC island market)
**Emerging Markets:** Saskatoon (football-passionate), Moncton (Maritime hub)

Each city profile includes:
• Population and metro area demographics
• Stadium/venue situation and requirements
• Competitive sports landscape
• Corporate sponsorship base potential
• Football culture and CFL history

### Write Your City Selection Rationale
**Due: End of Week 2**

Include:
• Chosen expansion city
• 200-300 word rationale: Why does this market represent the best CFL expansion opportunity? What challenges will you address?

**Deliverable:** Export your selection from the tool below, then upload to Milestone 1 Submission (Element 5)

**Grading:** See rubric criteria in the submission section below.

**Use the City Selector below to explore your options!**

### Student-Facing Text Content:
**Copy this markdown directly into Uplimit BEFORE the tool:**

```markdown
# Choose Your CFL Expansion City

Now it's time to select the Canadian market for your CFL expansion franchise. This decision shapes your entire project—you'll develop media strategy, sponsorship plans, and brand identity for this city over the next four weeks.

## Why This Matters

The city you select determines:
- **Market dynamics**: Population, demographics, and economic base vary significantly
- **Competitive landscape**: Some cities have no pro sports competition; others face crowded markets
- **Stadium requirements**: Some have existing facilities; others need new builds
- **Your strategic challenges**: Each market presents unique obstacles to overcome

## Using the CFL City Selector

The interactive tool below helps you explore **6 potential Canadian expansion markets**:

**High Viability Markets:**
- **Halifax** - Atlantic Canada's largest city, no major pro sports, strong university football culture
- **Quebec City** - Passionate French-Canadian market, proven sports support, provincial capital

**Medium Viability Markets:**
- **London ON** - Strong corporate base, Western Mustangs tradition, Ontario market growth
- **Victoria** - Affluent demographics, mild climate, tech sector growth

**Emerging Markets:**
- **Saskatoon** - Football-obsessed province, second Saskatchewan team potential
- **Moncton** - Proven Touchdown Atlantic success, bilingual Maritime hub

## How It Works

1. **Review City Profiles** - Browse the city cards showing population, stadium status, competition, corporate base
2. **Compare Markets** - Toggle to table view for side-by-side comparison of all 6 cities
3. **Select Your City** - Click "Select This City" on your chosen market
4. **Write Rationale** - Explain your strategic reasoning (200-300 words) using the prompts provided
5. **Export Proposal** - Download your selection as a .txt file
6. **Upload to Milestone 1** - Submit your exported file in the File Upload section below

## Strategic Considerations

Before choosing, consider:
- **Stadium situation**: Does the city have an existing facility or will you need to propose a new build?
- **Competition**: How will you position CFL football against existing sports options?
- **Corporate base**: Is there sufficient sponsorship potential to support a franchise?
- **Fan development**: What's the football culture like? Will you build on existing passion or create new fans?

**Time:** 15-20 minutes to explore cities and write your rationale
```

## Element 9: CFL Expansion Project FAQs (Optional Guidance)

### Details Content - Anchor Project FAQs:
```
Title: ◆ CFL Expansion Project FAQs

[Expand for answers to common questions]

**Q: Can I choose a city not on the list?**
A: Yes, with instructor approval. Your city must: (1) Be a Canadian market not currently
served by the CFL, (2) Have a metro population of at least 150,000, (3) Present realistic
expansion potential. Submit your alternative city proposal for approval before proceeding.

**Q: What if multiple students choose the same city?**
A: That's encouraged! Different students will develop different strategies for the same
market. This mirrors real consulting—you might compete for the same expansion bid.
Comparing different approaches in Week 5 discussions will be valuable learning.

**Q: How much time should I invest in the CFL Expansion Project each week?**
A: Week 2: 1-2 hours (city selection and rationale)
   Week 3: 2-3 hours (media strategy and sponsorship plan)
   Week 4: 3-4 hours (brand identity and marketing strategy)
   Week 5: 4-6 hours (final expansion proposal)

**Q: Where can I find data about my chosen city?**
A: Start with Statistics Canada for demographics, municipal economic development
sites for corporate presence, and local sports news for competitive landscape.
The tool includes key data points, but deeper research strengthens your proposal.

**Q: What resources are available beyond the tools?**
A: Each week provides frameworks and templates specific to CFL expansion. Use office
hours for check-ins. The AI chat assistants can help with market analysis questions.

## Element 11: Final Project Connection

## 🎯 FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION

**How Week 2 Supports Your Final Strategic Vision:**

Week 2 taught you how to evaluate and design media rights strategies—typically the largest revenue stream (often 40–60%, varying by league) for most sports properties. This expertise is central to your Week 5 capstone.

**What You Mastered:**
- Media rights valuation frameworks (audience × demographics × exclusivity × platform reach)
- Platform economics (linear advertising vs. streaming subscription models)
- Deal structure and negotiation (term, exclusivity, revenue models, flexibility clauses)
- Performance evaluation (projected vs. actual analysis, mistake identification, strategic pivots)

**How to Apply This to Your Final Project:**

Your Week 5 strategic vision must integrate Week 2's media frameworks comprehensively:

- **Media Rights Section (likely 30-40% of your capstone):** This is your property's largest revenue stream. Use Week 2's valuation tools, platform comparison frameworks, and deal structure templates to design a sophisticated 5-year media strategy.
- **Integration with Other Weeks:** Media strategy connects to everything: Week 1 (ecosystem effects), Week 3 (sponsorship amplification through media), Week 4 (athlete brand exposure via media), Week 5 (heritage vs. innovation in media approach).
- **Real Numbers:** Your vision needs quantitative projections. Use Week 2's tools and case data to benchmark realistic media rights valuations for your property.

**Integration Across All Weeks:**
- Week 1 = Revenue ecosystem foundation
- **Week 2 = Media rights specialization (typically 40–60% of revenue)**
- Week 3 = Sponsorship/betting specialization
- Week 4 = Athlete brand specialization
- Week 5 = Synthesis into 5-year vision

**Real-World Application:** Media strategy is the foundation of modern sports economics. Your Week 5 capstone must demonstrate mastery of this domain—Week 2 provided the technical toolkit.
