Title: ‚óâ Week 2 Key Takeaways

You've completed your deep dive into media rights and fan monetization! Here's what
you should take away:

‚úì Sports remain "appointment viewing" in an on-demand world‚Äîthis drives premium valuations
‚úì Streaming economics differ fundamentally from linear TV (LTV vs. immediate ROI)
‚úì Fan engagement monetization extends beyond passive viewing (data, sponsorship, retention)
‚úì Mega-deals like Rogers/NHL require scenario planning and flexibility‚Äîdisruption happens

This foundation prepares you for Week 3, where we'll explore the fastest-growing revenue
streams: sponsorship activation and sports betting integration.

Plus: This week you'll form your Anchor Project team and select your sport property!

Well done! üëè

### Text Content - Anchor Project Milestone 1:
```
## ‚óâ Anchor Project: Team Formation & Property Selection

Welcome to the **Anchor Project** - your 60% final assessment for this course!

Over the next 4 weeks, your team will develop a comprehensive marketing plan for a
sport organization. This week (Week 2), you'll form your team and choose your property.

**What You'll Accomplish This Week:**

### Step 1: Form Your Team (5-6 students)
Use the **Team Charter Builder** tool below to:
‚Ä¢ Introduce yourselves (background, interests, strengths)
‚Ä¢ Define roles (Project Manager, Research Lead, Financial Analyst, Creative Lead, etc.)
‚Ä¢ Establish communication norms (meeting frequency, response times, tools)
‚Ä¢ Create conflict resolution process

### Step 2: Select Your Sport Property
Use the **Property Selection Tool** below to explore 19 curated options:

**Legacy Properties:** Established teams/leagues (e.g., Toronto FC, Vancouver Whitecaps, Rugby Canada)
**Emerging Sports:** High-growth opportunities (e.g., Canadian Premier League, National Lacrosse League)
**Major Events:** One-time or recurring events (e.g., 2026 FIFA World Cup - Toronto/Vancouver)

Your team should choose a property that:
‚Ä¢ Is interesting and marketable
‚Ä¢ Presents clear business challenges (revenue growth, fan engagement, market expansion)
‚Ä¢ Has accessible public information (financial data, attendance, media presence)

### Step 3: Write Your 1-Page Project Proposal
**Due: End of Week 2**

Include:
‚Ä¢ Team roster with roles
‚Ä¢ Chosen sport property
‚Ä¢ 250-word rationale: Why is this property interesting? What marketing challenges does it face?

**Deliverable:** Upload PDF to [submission portal]

**Grading:** This milestone is worth 10 points (of 60 total project points). Evaluated
on team composition, property selection defensibility, and articulated challenges.

### Details Content - Anchor Project FAQs:
```
Title: ‚óÜ Anchor Project FAQs

[Expand for answers to common questions]

**Q: How many team members should we have?**
A: 5-6 students is ideal. Fewer than 5 makes workload challenging; more than 6 creates
coordination overhead.

**Q: Can we choose a property not on the list?**
A: Yes, with instructor approval. Your property must: (1) Have sufficient public data
available, (2) Present clear marketing challenges, (3) Be a professional or semi-pro
organization (not amateur/recreational). Submit your proposal for approval.

**Q: What if our chosen property is also chosen by another team?**
A: That's fine! Different teams will develop different strategies for the same property.
This mirrors real consulting competitions.

**Q: How much time should we invest in the Anchor Project each week?**
A: Week 2: 2-3 hours (team formation, property selection)
   Week 3: 2-3 hours (revenue model development)
   Week 4: 3-4 hours (brand strategy, competitive analysis)
   Week 5: 4-6 hours (final presentation preparation)

**Q: What if a team member isn't contributing?**
A: Your Team Charter should include accountability mechanisms. If issues persist, use
your conflict resolution process. As a last resort, contact the instructor. Peer
evaluations in Week 5 will account for individual contributions.

**Q: Can we interview executives at our chosen property?**
A: Absolutely! Original research strengthens your project. If you conduct interviews,
include key insights and quotes in your final presentation.

**Q: What resources are available beyond the tools?**
A: Each week provides readings, frameworks, and templates. Use office hours for team
check-ins. The AI chat assistants can help with specific questions. Discussion forums
are great for crowdsourcing ideas from other teams.

## üéØ FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION

**How Week 2 Supports Your Final Strategic Vision:**

Week 2 taught you how to evaluate and design media rights strategies‚Äîthe largest revenue stream (40-60%) for most sports properties. This expertise is central to your Week 5 capstone.

**What You Mastered:**
- Media rights valuation frameworks (audience √ó demographics √ó exclusivity √ó platform reach)
- Platform economics (linear advertising vs. streaming subscription models)
- Deal structure and negotiation (term, exclusivity, revenue models, flexibility clauses)
- Performance evaluation (projected vs. actual analysis, mistake identification, strategic pivots)

**How to Apply This to Your Final Project:**

Your Week 5 strategic vision must integrate Week 2's media frameworks comprehensively:

- **Media Rights Section (likely 30-40% of your capstone):** This is your property's largest revenue stream. Use Week 2's valuation tools, platform comparison frameworks, and deal structure templates to design a sophisticated 5-year media strategy.
- **Integration with Other Weeks:** Media strategy connects to everything: Week 1 (ecosystem effects), Week 3 (sponsorship amplification through media), Week 4 (athlete brand exposure via media), Week 5 (heritage vs. innovation in media approach).
- **Real Numbers:** Your vision needs quantitative projections. Use Week 2's widgets and case data to benchmark realistic media rights valuations for your property.

**Integration Across All Weeks:**
- Week 1 = Revenue ecosystem foundation
- **Week 2 = Media rights specialization (40-60% of revenue)**
- Week 3 = Sponsorship/betting specialization
- Week 4 = Athlete brand specialization
- Week 5 = Synthesis into 5-year vision

**Real-World Application:** Media strategy is the foundation of modern sports economics. Your Week 5 capstone must demonstrate mastery of this domain‚ÄîWeek 2 provided the technical toolkit.
