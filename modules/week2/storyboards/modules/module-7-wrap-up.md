Title: ◉ Week 2 Key Takeaways

You've completed your deep dive into media rights and fan engagement! The five critical insights: (1) media rights are valued using CPM, reach, and exclusivity metrics—not just audience size, (2) streaming disruption creates both threats (cord-cutting) and opportunities (global reach, direct-to-consumer), (3) long-term rights deals carry significant risk when technology and consumption patterns shift mid-contract, (4) fan engagement monetization requires balancing reach (free content) against revenue (paywalls), and (5) platform strategy matters as much as content quality. This foundation prepares you for Week 3's focus on sponsorship activation and sports betting partnerships—revenue streams that amplify media value. Well done!

**Up Next:** CFL Expansion Milestone 2, then Week 3 preview.

## CFL Expansion Project: Milestone 2 - Media & Content Strategy

Building on your market selection from Milestone 1, you'll now develop a comprehensive media and content strategy for your CFL expansion franchise.

**Your Challenge:** How will your new CFL franchise maximize media value? What's your content strategy for building fans before the first game?

**Why This Matters:** Media rights typically represent 40-60% of professional sports revenue. Your expansion team needs a compelling media strategy to attract broadcast partners, build digital audience, and create fan engagement in a market with no existing CFL presence.

**Apply Week 2 Frameworks:**
- Use media rights valuation frameworks to estimate your franchise's media value
- Compare linear vs. streaming strategies for your market
- Design fan engagement tactics that move passive viewers to super-fans
- Reference the Rogers/NHL case lessons for deal structure considerations
