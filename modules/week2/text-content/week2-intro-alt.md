# Week 2 Introduction: Media Rights - The Billion-Dollar Core Product

In Week 1, you learned that media rights represent 40-60% of total revenue for major professional leagues. This week, we examine WHY sports content commands such premium valuations and HOW rights deals are structured, negotiated, and monetized.

Sports remain the last "appointment viewing" in an era of on-demand entertainment. Live games can't be spoiled by social media or watched later without losing cultural currency. This unique characteristic makes sports the most valuable programming for traditional broadcasters defending against cord-cutting—and the most expensive content for streaming platforms trying to acquire subscribers.

You'll analyze the Rogers Communications / NHL deal: $5.2 billion over 12 years for exclusive Canadian rights. Was it worth it? How do you value something this complex? What did Rogers get wrong—and what did they get right? By week's end, you'll understand media economics well enough to evaluate mega-deals yourself and recommend platform strategies for sports properties.
