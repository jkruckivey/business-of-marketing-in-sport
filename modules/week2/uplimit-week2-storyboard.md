### Text Content (week2-intro.docx):
```
Media Rights: The Billion-Dollar Core Product

In Week 1, you learned that media rights represent 40-60% of total revenue for major
professional leagues. This week, we examine WHY sports content commands such premium
valuations and HOW rights deals are structured, negotiated, and monetized.

Sports remain the last "appointment viewing" in an era of on-demand entertainment.
Live games can't be spoiled by social media or watched later without losing cultural
currency. This unique characteristic makes sports the most valuable programming for
traditional broadcasters defending against cord-cutting—and the most expensive content
for streaming platforms trying to acquire subscribers.

You'll analyze the Rogers Communications / NHL deal: $5.2 billion over 12 years for
exclusive Canadian rights. Was it worth it? How do you value something this complex?
What did Rogers get wrong—and what did they get right? By week's end, you'll understand
media economics well enough to evaluate mega-deals yourself and recommend platform
strategies for sports properties.
```

## 🎯 FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION

**How This Supports Your Final Strategic Vision:**

Your Week 2 Journey established that media rights (40-60% of revenue) are the foundation of modern sports economics. This focus prepares you to analyze media strategy in your Week 5 capstone.

**What You Learned:**
- Media rights are the largest and most strategically complex revenue stream
- Sports content is the last "appointment viewing" commanding premium valuations
- Week 2 dives deep into rights valuation, linear vs. streaming trade-offs, and fan monetization

**How to Apply This to Your Final Project:**

When you craft your 5-year strategic vision in Week 5, Your Week 2 Journey's media focus shapes your revenue projections:

- **Media Rights Strategy Section:** Your capstone must explain how your property will monetize content. Will you pursue traditional linear deals (guaranteed revenue, broad reach) or DTC streaming (potential upside, direct fan relationships)? This introduction laid out these trade-offs.
- **Revenue Weighting:** If media rights represent 40-60% of sports revenue, your property's media strategy demands the most sophisticated analysis in your vision. Week 2 signals where to invest analytical depth.
- **Market Context:** Use Week 2's frameworks to justify your media approach. Example: "Given declining linear viewership but sports' premium positioning as live content, our property will pursue a hybrid model—linear for reach, streaming for engagement."

**Real-World Application:** The Rogers/NHL $5.2B deal you'll analyze this week mirrors the decisions facing YOUR chosen property. Week 2 teaches you how executives evaluate billion-dollar media strategies.

## 🎯 FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION

**How This Supports Your Final Strategic Vision:**

Inside Media Rights delivered practitioner insights from executives who negotiate billion-dollar media deals. This real-world perspective grounds your Week 5 media strategy in operational reality.

**What You Learned:**
- Media deals involve complex trade-offs: reach vs. exclusivity, guaranteed fees vs. revenue share, linear vs. streaming
- Sports content commands premiums because it's live, communal, and can't be delayed
- Executives balance stakeholder pressures (leagues want maximum revenue, broadcasters want profitability, fans want access)

**How to Apply This to Your Final Project:**

When you design your 5-year media strategy in Week 5, reference the executive frameworks from Inside Media Rights:

- **Platform Selection Rationale:** Justify your media partner choice using executive decision criteria. Example: "Following Rogers' strategy of leveraging anchor sports content to extract larger media commitments across the portfolio (Week 2 executive interview with Al Dak), our property will pursue bundled deals that maximize total advertiser value."
- **Stakeholder Management:** Your vision must satisfy multiple stakeholders. Executives taught you that boards want revenue stability, fans want accessibility, and partners want exclusivity. Show how your media strategy balances these tensions.
- **Realistic Constraints:** Acknowledge market realities. If you're a small-market property, you won't command Rogers' $5.2B valuations. The executive insights from Inside Media Rights help you set realistic expectations.

**Real-World Application:** The executive you heard from evaluates media opportunities daily. Your Week 5 capstone will undergo similar scrutiny from skeptical stakeholders. Inside Media Rights taught you how practitioners defend media strategies.

### Element 1: Text - Why Media Rights Matter (120 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# Media Rights: The Billion-Dollar Foundation

Media rights—fees paid by broadcasters and streaming platforms to air games—represent the **largest revenue stream** for most professional leagues, typically accounting for **40-60% of total revenue**.

These deals are massive: The NFL's current media rights contracts total **$110 billion over 11 years** ($10B/year). The English Premier League generates over **$5 billion per year** from domestic and international broadcast rights.

**Why sports command premium value:**
- Live games create **"appointment viewing"** (can't watch later without spoilers)
- Sports deliver **simultaneous audiences** (rare in 2024 on-demand world)
- Premium advertising rates: Sports CPM **$50-70** vs. scripted TV **$15-25**

This module explores HOW broadcasters value these rights deals.

### Element 4: Widget 1 - Audience Size Calculator

### ⚙ Interactive Activity: Audience Size Calculator

**Practice: WLO 2.1 (Explore media rights valuation)**

You've learned that media rights represent 40-60% of league revenue—but what actually determines how much a league can charge for its rights? The answer starts with audience size and demographics.

In this interactive activity, you'll calculate the estimated media rights value for different leagues (NFL, NHL, NBA, MLS, Premier League, or create your own custom league) by manipulating audience size, game count, demographic premiums, and advertising rates. Watch how changing just one variable—like increasing coveted demo percentage from 30% to 50%—can add hundreds of millions to annual rights value.

**What you'll discover:**

- Why total audience reach (viewers × games) matters more than per-game ratings
- How the "coveted demo" (18-49 with $75K+ income) creates valuation premiums
- Why the NFL commands $10B annually while MLS gets $250M despite similar game counts
- That rights valuation is formula-driven, not arbitrary—you can calculate it yourself

**Time commitment:** 4-5 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** WLO 2.1 (Explore media rights valuation frameworks)

---

**🎮 Widget Purpose:** Demonstrate how audience size and demographics drive rights valuations using real league examples.

**Widget Status:** ⭕ Phase 3 widget - NEEDS TO BE BUILT (4-5 hours estimated)

   - Coveted demo % (18-49 with $75K+ income)
   - CPM (cost per thousand viewers) advertising rate
3. Real-time calculations display:
   - Total audience reach (viewers × games)
   - Premium audience value (demo multiplier)
   - Advertising revenue potential
   - Estimated annual rights value ($M)
   - Per-game rights value
   - Comparison bar chart vs. NFL baseline

**Real Examples:**
- **NFL:** 17M avg viewers, 272 games → **$10B/year**
- **NHL:** 1.5M avg viewers, 1,271 games → **$2B/year**
- **MLS:** 300K avg viewers, 408 games → **$250M/year**

**Learning Objectives:**

### Element 5: Text - Exclusivity & Competition Dynamics (150 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# Exclusivity Creates Bidding Wars

**Exclusive rights** cost 2-3x more than non-exclusive packages—but they're worth it for strategic reasons.

## Why Exclusivity Matters

**For Broadcasters:**
- Exclusive content can't be found elsewhere (drives subscriptions and viewership)
- Differentiation in crowded streaming market (e.g., Apple TV+ with MLS, Amazon with NFL Thursday)
- Bundling power: "Watch YOUR team only on our platform"

**For Leagues:**
- Multiple bidders drive prices up exponentially
- Competition between traditional networks, streamers (Netflix, Apple, Amazon), and tech giants (Google, Meta)
- Example: NFL split packages across CBS, FOX, NBC, ESPN, Amazon—maximized total value

## The Bidding War Dynamic

When Amazon entered NFL rights bidding (2021), traditional networks had to raise bids to compete. Result: NFL rights increased 75% from previous deal despite stable ratings.

**Next: Experience exclusivity bidding through simulation.**
```

### Element 6: Widget 2 - Exclusivity Bidding Simulator

### ⚙ Interactive Activity: Exclusivity Bidding Simulator

**Practice: WLO 2.1 (Explore media rights valuation and deal structures)**

You've calculated what drives rights valuation—now experience the strategic decision leagues face when multiple bidders compete for exclusive rights.

In this simulation, you're the NHL commissioner in 2025 facing three bidders for Canadian national rights: Rogers offers $450M/year (cautious after losing money), DAZN offers $550M/year (aggressive growth), and Apple TV+ offers $700M/year (strategic play). Do you accept Apple's exclusive $700M? Or split rights across all three for $1.15B total revenue but lose exclusivity? There's no obviously "right" answer—just strategic trade-offs.

**What you'll discover:**

- Why a single bidder paying $700M can be worth LESS than multiple bidders paying $1.15B combined
- How exclusivity creates bidding premiums (Apple pays more to be the ONLY platform)
- The hidden costs of split rights packages (coordination complexity, partner conflicts)
- Why leagues sometimes choose lower bids for strategic reasons (accessibility, partner reliability)

**Time commitment:** 5-6 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** WLO 2.1 (Explore media rights valuation and competitive dynamics)

1. **Scenario:** You are NHL commissioner in 2025. Three bidders want Canadian national rights:
   - **Rogers (incumbent):** $450M/year (cautious, lost money on 2014 deal)
   - **DAZN (streaming disruptor):** $550M/year (aggressive growth strategy)
   - **Apple TV+ (tech giant):** $700M/year (strategic not financial decision)

2. **Student Decision:** Accept Apple's $700M exclusive OR Split rights package:
   - Rogers $450M regional + DAZN $400M national + Apple $300M streaming = $1.15B total (non-exclusive)

3. **Outcomes Display:**
   - **Exclusive Apple ($700M/year):** Pros: Predictable revenue, single partner. Cons: Canadian fans need subscription, lower total revenue
   - **Split Package ($1.15B/year):** Pros: 64% higher revenue, better accessibility. Cons: Complex coordination, potential conflicts

**Learning Objectives:**
- WLO 2.1: Understand exclusivity premium
- Experience competitive bidding dynamics
- Recognize trade-offs: Highest bidder vs. accessibility vs. total revenue

**Technical Specifications:**
```javascript
const bidders = [
  { name: "Rogers", bid: 450, rationale: "Risk-averse. Prefers regional only." },
  { name: "DAZN", bid: 550, rationale: "Aggressive growth. Needs anchor content." },
  { name: "Apple TV+", bid: 700, rationale: "Strategic acquisition. Global ambitions." }
];

function calculatePackageValue(exclusiveOption, splitOptions) {
  return exclusiveOption ?
    { annual: exclusiveOption.bid, type: "Exclusive" } :
    { annual: splitOptions.reduce((sum, o) => sum + o.bid, 0), type: "Split" };
}
```

**Accessibility:**
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter to reveal/select)
- ✅ ARIA live regions for bid reveals
- ✅ Screen reader compatible bid cards
- ✅ High contrast mode
- ✅ Focus indicators on interactive cards

**Implementation Notes:** Card-based interface with reveal animation, comparison logic, strategic insights panel. Preset scenarios for NHL, NFL, Premier League.

### Element 7: Infobox (Note) - Key Insight: Appointment Viewing

```
Title: ▶ Key Insight: "Appointment Viewing" in an On-Demand World

Sports are the last true appointment viewing. You can't watch a game "later" without risking spoilers from social media, friends, or news alerts. This creates:

• Predictable, simultaneous audience (rare in 2024)
• Premium advertising rates (live = engaged = valuable)
• Subscription retention power (can't cancel during season)
• Cultural currency ("Did you see that play?")

This unique characteristic explains why sports rights command prices that seem economically irrational—until you understand their strategic defensive value for traditional broadcasters and offensive value for streaming disruptors.
```

**Design Note:** Yellow Infobox (Note variant). Reinforces WHY bidders compete aggressively.

---

### 📝 CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING: Exclusivity & Competition

### ⚙ Interactive Widget: Exclusivity & Competition Knowledge Check

**Quick Quiz (2 minutes)** - Test your grasp of exclusivity dynamics and appointment viewing before continuing.

This interactive knowledge check covers three key concepts:
1. Why exclusive rights command 2-3x premium pricing (competitive bidding wars)
2. What makes sports "appointment viewing" in 2024 (spoiler risk forcing live viewing)
3. NFL's strategic package splits (maximizing total value through multiple bidders)

This is not graded—it's designed to help you identify concepts to focus on as you continue through the module. You'll receive immediate feedback on each question with real-world examples.

**Embed:** `modules/week2/widgets/exclusivity-competition-quiz.html`

**Accessibility features:**
- ✅ Full keyboard navigation
- ✅ Screen reader support with ARIA labels
- ✅ High contrast mode compatible

### Element 8: Text - Linear TV vs. Streaming Intro (120 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# Two Business Models, Different Economics

Traditional linear broadcasting and direct-to-consumer streaming have **fundamentally different economics**—which explains why sports rights deals are structured differently for each platform.

## Linear TV (Traditional Broadcasting)
- **Revenue:** Advertising (80%) + carriage fees from cable/satellite providers (20%)
- **Goal:** Maximize viewership to sell ads at premium rates
- **Timeline:** Immediate profitability expected (if deal priced correctly)
- **Risk:** Cord-cutting and audience fragmentation

## Streaming/DTC (Direct-to-Consumer)
- **Revenue:** Subscriptions (90%) + advertising tier (10%)
- **Goal:** Acquire and retain subscribers (customer lifetime value thinking)
- **Timeline:** 3-5 year payback period (invest in growth first)
- **Risk:** Subscriber churn and price sensitivity

**Next: Compare models side-by-side and explore trade-offs.**
```

### Element 9: Table - Platform Economics Comparison

| **Model** | **Revenue Sources** | **Cost Structure** | **Key Risks** | **Profitability Timeline** | **Sports Strategy** |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **Linear TV** | Ad revenue (80%)<br>Carriage fees (20%) | Rights fees<br>Production costs | Cord-cutting<br>Audience fragmentation | Immediate (if priced right) | Defend subscribers<br>Must-have to prevent cancellation |
| **Streaming/DTC** | Subscriptions (90%)<br>Advertising tier (10%) | Rights fees<br>Technology infrastructure<br>Customer acquisition costs | Subscriber churn<br>Price sensitivity<br>Content overload | 3-5 years (customer LTV model) | Acquire new users<br>Reduce churn with exclusive sports |

**Table Note:** "Economics vary significantly by property and market. These represent typical patterns for major sports rights deals in 2024."

### Element 10: Widget 3 - Platform Economics Visualizer

### ⚙ Interactive Activity: Platform Economics Visualizer

**Practice: WLO 2.2 (Compare linear broadcasting to streaming/DTC models)**

You've learned that linear TV and streaming platforms operate on fundamentally different economics. But what does that actually mean for profitability? Why do streaming platforms lose money for years while traditional broadcasters either profit immediately or never break even?

In this interactive activity, you'll toggle between Linear TV and Streaming/DTC models, adjusting key variables (rights costs, ad rates, subscription price, churn rate, customer acquisition costs) and watching a 10-year projection chart show when—or if—each platform becomes profitable. Try recreating Rogers' NHL deal (linear TV, never profitable, ~$1.5B loss) or DAZN Canada (streaming, profitable by Year 4).

**What you'll discover:**

- Why streaming platforms lose money for 3-5 years by design (customer lifetime value thinking)
- How cord-cutting destroys linear TV profitability even if rights deals seem "fair" at signing
- Why tech giants like Apple can "overpay" for rights—they're buying subscribers, not immediate profit
- The mathematics behind Rogers' $1.5B loss on the NHL deal (subscriber decline killed them)

**Time commitment:** 6-7 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** WLO 2.2 (Compare linear vs. streaming economics and profitability models)

---

**🎮 Widget Purpose:** Let students manipulate platform economics variables and see how profitability timelines differ between linear TV and streaming models.

**Widget Status:** ⭕ Phase 2 widget - NEEDS TO BE BUILT (6-7 hours estimated)

**How It Works:**
1. Toggle between **Linear TV** and **Streaming/DTC**
2. Adjust variables with sliders:
   - **Linear TV:** Rights cost, ad CPM, carriage fee, starting subscribers, annual decline %
   - **Streaming:** Rights cost, subscription price, starting subs, monthly growth %, churn rate, CAC
3. View 10-year projection:
   - Line chart: Annual revenue vs. costs
   - Break-even year (or "Never")
   - Cumulative profit/loss
   - Strategic insights (dynamic based on inputs)

**Real-World Presets:**
- **Rogers NHL (Linear):** $433M rights, 11.2M → 8.1M subs, NEVER profitable (loss ~$1.5B over 10 years)
- **DAZN Canada (Streaming):** $50M rights, 50K → 500K subs, profitable Year 4 (+$200M by Year 10)
- **Apple TV+ MLS (Streaming):** $250M rights, 0 → 2M subs, profitable Year 5 IF targets met

**Learning Objectives:**
- WLO 2.2: Compare linear vs. streaming profitability through manipulation
- Understand why streaming "loses money for years"
- Recognize cord-cutting impact on linear TV
- Appreciate why tech giants can "overpay" (LTV thinking)

**Technical Specifications:**
```javascript
function calculateLinearTV(rightsCost, adCPM, carriageFee, startingSubs, annualDecline, years = 10) {
  let results = [];
  let subscribers = startingSubs;
  for (let year = 1; year <= years; year++) {
    subscribers *= (1 - annualDecline);
    const avgViewership = subscribers * 0.15;
    const adRevenue = avgViewership * 50 * adCPM / 1000;
    const carriageRevenue = subscribers * carriageFee * 12;
    const totalRevenue = adRevenue + carriageRevenue;
    const costs = rightsCost + (avgViewership * 2);
    results.push({ year, revenue: totalRevenue, costs, profit: totalRevenue - costs });
  }
  return results;
}

function calculateStreaming(rightsCost, subPrice, startingSubs, monthlyGrowth, churnRate, CAC, years = 10) {
  let results = [];
  let subscribers = startingSubs;
  for (let year = 1; year <= years; year++) {
    for (let month = 1; month <= 12; month++) {
      subscribers = subscribers + (subscribers * monthlyGrowth) - (subscribers * churnRate);
    }
    const revenue = subscribers * subPrice * 12;
    const costs = rightsCost + (startingSubs * CAC);
    results.push({ year, revenue, costs, profit: revenue - costs });
  }
  return results;
}
```

### Element 11: Text - Fan Engagement Monetization (150 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# Beyond Passive Viewing: Engagement as Revenue Driver

Modern sports monetization extends beyond passive viewing. **Active fan engagement** creates multiple revenue streams and increases customer lifetime value.

## The Engagement Value Chain

**Passive Viewer** (Low Value):
- Watches games occasionally
- Generates: Advertising impressions, basic viewership metrics
- Value: $5-15/year

**Engaged Fan** (Medium Value):
- Watches regularly + uses team app + follows on social media
- Generates: Premium ad rates, app sponsorship opportunities, first-party data
- Value: $50-100/year

**Super-Fan** (High Value):
- Watches everything + fantasy sports + betting + exclusive content subscriptions
- Generates: Premium subscriptions, betting partnerships, exclusive content monetization
- Value: $300-500+/year

## Why Engagement Matters for Rights Deals

Platforms that drive engagement (interactive features, fantasy integration, betting) justify higher rights costs because they extract more value per viewer.

**Next: Build your own engagement value chain.**
```

---

### Element 12: Widget 4 - Engagement Value Chain Builder

### ⚙ Interactive Activity: Engagement Value Chain Builder

**Practice: WLO 2.3 (Understand fan engagement monetization strategies)**

You've explored how platforms make money from media rights. But passive viewing generates only $5-15 per fan per year. The real value comes from ENGAGEMENT—converting passive viewers into active participants who bet, play fantasy, subscribe to exclusive content, and interact with team apps.

In this interactive activity, you'll construct an engagement strategy by selecting tactics (mobile app, fantasy integration, betting partnerships, exclusive content, social media, gamification) and watching your fan value transform. Start with 1M passive fans worth $10M/year—then see how adding betting partnerships alone can increase value to $13M+ despite costing nothing (revenue share model). Build the optimal engagement mix.

**What you'll discover:**

- Why a fan who bets is worth 6-10x more than a passive viewer ($30 vs. $5 per year)
- How engagement tactics have vastly different cost/benefit profiles (betting = $0 cost, high value; exclusive content = $3M cost, high value)
- Why platforms with engagement capabilities (ESPN Bet, DraftKings partnerships) can justify paying more for rights
- The mathematics of converting 10% of your audience to "super-fans" worth $300-500 each

**Time commitment:** 5-6 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** WLO 2.3 (Understand fan engagement monetization beyond passive viewing)

---

**🎮 Widget Purpose:** Let students construct an engagement strategy and see how different tactics increase fan value and justify higher rights costs.

**Widget Status:** ⭕ Phase 3 widget - NEEDS TO BE BUILT (5-6 hours estimated)

**How It Works:**
1. Choose sport type (NHL, NBA, MLS, NFL, EPL)
2. Set baseline: 1M fans, $10/year passive value
3. Select engagement tactics (checkboxes with costs/benefits):
   - **Mobile App:** +$2M cost → 30% adopt → +$5/fan value
   - **Fantasy Integration:** +$500K cost → 15% participate → +$15/fan value
   - **Betting Partnerships:** $0 cost (revenue share) → 10% engage → +$30/fan value
   - **Exclusive Content:** +$3M cost → 20% subscribe → +$25/fan value
   - **Social Media Strategy:** +$1M cost → 50% follow → +$8/fan value
   - **Gamification:** +$1.5M cost → 25% participate → +$12/fan value
4. View results:
   - Engagement funnel visualization (passive → engaged → super-fan)
   - Total fan value: $XX.XM/year
   - ROI: (Total value - costs) / costs
   - Rights affordability: "With engagement, you can afford $XXM/year in rights"

**Real Examples:**
- **NBA + DraftKings:** Fan value $12 → $45/year (fantasy + betting)
- **Premier League + Social:** International fan value $5 → $18/year

**Learning Objectives:**
- WLO 2.3: Understand how engagement extends monetization beyond passive viewing
- Evaluate trade-offs: High-cost/high-value vs. low-cost/broad-reach
- Understand why platforms with engagement capabilities pay more for rights

**Technical Specifications:**

  selectedTactics.forEach(tactic => {
    const engagedFans = baseFans * tactic.adoptionRate;
    totalValue += engagedFans * tactic.valuePerFan;
    totalCost += tactic.cost;
  });
  const roi = ((totalValue - totalCost) / totalCost) * 100;
  const affordableRights = totalValue * 0.70; // 30% profit margin

## 🎯 FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION

**How This Supports Your Final Strategic Vision:**

The Billion-Dollar Core Product taught media rights valuation and platform economics through interactive widgets. This quantitative foundation enables sophisticated media strategy in your Week 5 capstone.

**What You Learned:**
- Media rights valuation frameworks (audience size × demographics × exclusivity × platform reach)
- Streaming economics vs. linear broadcasting (subscription vs. advertising models)
- Platform comparison tools for evaluating linear, streaming, and hybrid strategies
- Fan engagement extends monetization beyond viewing (betting, interactive features, multi-platform)

**How to Apply This to Your Final Project:**

When you build your 5-year strategic vision in Week 5, The Billion-Dollar Core Product's widgets provide your media analysis toolkit:

- **Rights Valuation:** Use the valuation calculator to estimate your property's media rights value. Example: "Our property reaches 2M viewers (demographics: 18-49, high income), projected 3-year deal value: $150-200M using Week 2's valuation framework."
- **Platform Strategy:** Reference the platform comparison widget to justify linear vs. streaming vs. hybrid approach. Show trade-offs quantitatively: guaranteed revenue vs. potential upside, reach vs. engagement, risk vs. reward.
- **Fan Monetization Model:** The Billion-Dollar Core Product taught that media value extends beyond broadcast fees. Your vision should quantify multi-platform monetization: subscription revenue + advertising + betting partnerships + interactive features.

**Real-World Application:** The interactive widgets you used mirror the financial models media executives build to evaluate deals. When you pitch your media strategy, reference these tools to ground projections in industry standards.

## The Billion-Dollar Core Product Complete - Transition to Streaming Wars

**What You've Accomplished:**
You've explored media rights economics through hands-on discovery using 4 interactive widgets. You understand how leagues calculate media rights value, how streaming platform economics differ from traditional broadcasting, how rights holders compare linear vs. DTC strategies, and why fan engagement drives monetization across multiple channels. You've actively manipulated variables, experimented with scenarios, and discovered principles through exploration—not passive reading.

**Key Takeaways:**
- **Media rights valuation** depends on audience size, demographics, exclusivity, and platform reach—not just viewership numbers
- **Streaming economics** fundamentally differ from linear broadcasting: subscription-driven, targeted engagement vs. advertising-driven, mass reach
- **Rights holders face strategic trade-offs**: guaranteed fees from traditional broadcasters vs. potential upside from DTC platforms
- **Fan engagement extends monetization** beyond passive viewing through betting integration, interactive features, and multi-platform distribution
- The 4 widgets you used revealed that **no single "right" strategy exists**—success depends on league maturity, market position, and risk tolerance

### Details Content:
```
Title: ◆ Strategic Considerations (Open if you're stuck)

Not sure how to approach this simulation? Here are some frameworks:

**Customer Lifetime Value (LTV):**
How long will subscribers stay? If average subscriber stays 18 months at $19.99/month,
their LTV is ~$360. How much can you spend to acquire them? How much on content to
retain them?

**Content Portfolio Strategy:**
• Anchor Properties: High-cost, broad appeal (e.g., NHL, NBA) - drive subscriptions
• Niche Properties: Lower-cost, targeted appeal (e.g., esports, rugby) - reduce churn
• Emerging Properties: Speculative bets (e.g., women's sports, new leagues) - differentiation

**The Streaming Profitability Paradox:**
Growth requires spending on content AND customer acquisition. Profitability requires
reducing both. Most streaming services lose money for 3-5 years building scale.

**Pricing Strategy:**
• Too low: Can't cover content costs, perceived as low-quality
• Too high: Small addressable market, high churn risk
• Sweet spot: Premium enough to signal quality, accessible enough for mass market

**Rights Negotiation:**
• Exclusive rights cost 2-3x more than non-exclusive
• Multi-year deals lock in costs but reduce flexibility
• Regional rights (Canada-only) cheaper than global but smaller audience

**Engagement Investments:**
Beyond just streaming games, consider: interactive features, fantasy integration,
social viewing, original content (documentaries, shoulder programming).
These reduce churn but add costs.

**Key Question:**
What is your differentiation? Why do subscribers choose YOU over competitors?
```

**Design Rationale:**
- **iFrame widget** provides experiential learning of complex economics (UDL engagement, Application level)
- **Infobox** clearly frames task and connects to WLOs (QM clarity)
- **Reflection prompt** encourages metacognition and case study preparation (transfer)
- **AI Chat** offers adaptive support for struggling students (UDL scaffolding)
- **Details** provides strategic frameworks without prescribing answers (progressive disclosure)
- Multiple paths to profitability - no single "right" strategy (UDL choice)
- Directly prepares students to evaluate Rogers deal critically (WLO 2.4)

## 🎯 FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION

**How This Supports Your Final Strategic Vision:**

Streaming Wars Simulation gave you hands-on experience building a direct-to-consumer media strategy. This is critical for your Week 5 capstone if your property pursues DTC.

**What You Learned:**
- Streaming economics require balancing content acquisition costs, customer acquisition, pricing, and churn
- Platform profitability takes 3-5 years due to upfront investment in content and marketing
- Strategic trade-offs: exclusive rights (2-3× cost) vs. non-exclusive, broad content portfolio vs. niche focus

**How to Apply This to Your Final Project:**

When you craft your 5-year media strategy in Week 5, Streaming Wars Simulation provides your DTC analysis framework:

- **Build vs. License Decision:** If your property considers launching its own streaming service, use the simulation economics to model profitability timelines. Example: "Following Streaming Wars Simulation learnings, our DTC platform requires $50M initial investment with break-even projected in Year 4."
- **Content Strategy:** The simulation taught portfolio balance—anchor properties (broad appeal, high cost) + niche content (retention, lower cost). Apply this to your property's content mix.
- **Customer Economics:** Reference the LTV calculations from the simulation to justify pricing. Show subscriber lifetime value exceeds acquisition cost.

**Real-World Application:** Major leagues (NBA, NFL, NHL) are evaluating DTC strategies. Streaming Wars Simulation mirrors the financial models they build to decide whether to launch proprietary streaming services.

### Element 1: Infobox - Case Overview

```
Title: Case Study: Rogers Communications - The $5.2 Billion NHL Bet ▸

Context:
In 2013, Rogers Communications shocked the sports media world by paying $5.2 billion for exclusive Canadian NHL rights—12 years, all platforms, all games. It was the largest sports media deal in Canadian history and a massive strategic bet on hockey's enduring value.

Key Questions for Analysis:
1. How did Rogers value the NHL rights at $5.2 billion? What assumptions did they make?
2. What were the strategic goals beyond pure ROI (e.g., brand positioning, competitive defense)?
3. How did the deal perform vs. expectations? What went right and wrong?
4. What should Rogers do in 2026 when the deal expires?

This case addresses all Week 2 WLOs:
• WLO 2.1: Rights valuation methodology
• WLO 2.2: Platform strategy (linear Sportsnet + streaming)
• WLO 2.3: Fan engagement and monetization tactics
• WLO 2.4: Evaluation of mega-deal success/failure

### Element 2: Text - Case Background (150 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# Rogers Communications: Company Background (2013)

**Who:** Rogers Communications, Canada's largest telecommunications and media company. In 2013, Rogers owned:
- Rogers Wireless (largest mobile carrier, 9.5M subscribers)
- Rogers Cable (cable TV and internet, 2.3M subscribers)
- **Sportsnet** (sports broadcasting network, distant #2 to TSN)

**Strategic Challenge:** By 2013, Rogers faced existential threats:
- Cord-cutting accelerating (cable subscribers declining 5%/year)
- TSN (Bell Media) dominated sports broadcasting with NHL, NBA, CFL, FIFA
- Netflix and streaming disrupting traditional TV

**The Opportunity:** NHL's Canadian rights deal with CBC/TSN was expiring in 2014. Rogers saw a chance to acquire the crown jewel of Canadian sports and transform Sportsnet from challenger to leader.

**The Stakes:** A $5.2B bet—equivalent to 15% of Rogers' entire market capitalization. Success could secure Rogers' media future. Failure could cripple the company for a decade.

**Next: Explore the deal terms and what Rogers got for $5.2 billion.**

### Element 3: Widget 5 - Rogers Deal Terms Explorer

### ⚙ Interactive Activity: Rogers Deal Terms Explorer

**Practice: WLO 2.4 (Evaluate the Rogers $5.2B NHL deal and its implications)**

You've learned how media rights are valued and how platforms make money. Now analyze the most famous—and controversial—media rights deal in Canadian history: Rogers' $5.2 billion, 12-year exclusive NHL agreement. What exactly did $5.2 billion buy? Was it worth it?

In this interactive activity, you'll explore 5 tabs revealing what Rogers acquired: Rights Included (1,000+ games per season), Platforms Covered (linear TV, streaming, digital, radio), Exclusivity Terms (near-monopoly on NHL in Canada), Revenue Projections (Rogers forecasted break-even by Year 5), and Comparison to Previous Deal (209% more expensive than CBC/TSN's prior deal). Click through each tab to understand the deal's scope.

**What you'll discover:**

- The sheer SCOPE of $433M/year—Rogers bought every meaningful NHL touchpoint in Canada
- Why exclusivity commanded such a premium (TSN lost access entirely; Rogers could control distribution strategy)
- Rogers' internal revenue projections assumed 1M Sportsnet NOW subscribers by Year 5—spoiler: they never reached half that
- That the deal was 209% more expensive than the previous one—either Rogers overpaid or the NHL was vastly undervalued before

**Time commitment:** 5-6 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** WLO 2.4 (Evaluate Rogers deal terms, projections, and strategic rationale)

2. **Interactive Tabs (Click to Explore):**
   - **Rights Included:** What Rogers acquired
   - **Platforms Covered:** Where games could be shown
   - **Exclusivity Terms:** What competitors lost
   - **Revenue Projections:** What Rogers expected to earn
   - **Comparison to Previous Deal:** How much more Rogers paid

**Tab Content:**

**Tab 1: Rights Included**
- ✅ All national games (Hockey Night in Canada - Saturday nights)
- ✅ All regional games (all 7 Canadian teams - 82 games × 7 = 574 regional games)
- ✅ All playoff games (Stanley Cup Playoffs - Canadian teams + all rounds)
- ✅ International tournaments (World Cup of Hockey, Olympics qualifier games)
- ✅ Shoulder programming (pre-game, post-game, highlight shows)
- **Total:** 1,000+ games per season + shoulder content

**Tab 2: Platforms Covered**

- 📱 Streaming: Sportsnet NOW (subscription service, launched 2016)
- 💻 Digital: Sportsnet.ca website, mobile apps
- 📻 Radio: Sportsnet Radio network
- **Flexibility:** Rogers controlled all platforms (could shift games based on strategy)

**Tab 3: Exclusivity Terms**
- 🚫 TSN lost national rights (previously co-held with CBC)
- 🚫 CBC retained Hockey Night in Canada brand but sublicensed from Rogers (free over-air broadcast Saturdays)
- 🚫 No other Canadian broadcaster could show NHL games (except CBC sublicense)
- ✅ Regional rights for some teams retained by others (e.g., TSN had regional Ottawa Senators rights)
- **Result:** Rogers had near-monopoly on NHL content in Canada

**Tab 4: Revenue Projections (Rogers' Internal Forecast)**
- **Year 1 (2014-15):** $300M revenue (advertising + Sportsnet NOW subscriptions)
- **Year 3 (2016-17):** $425M revenue (subscriber growth + premium ad rates)
- **Year 5 (2018-19):** $500M revenue (break-even point)
- **Year 7 (2020-21):** $550M revenue (sustained profitability)
- **Assumptions:** 1M Sportsnet NOW subscribers by Year 5 @ $25/month + stable linear TV ad revenue

**Tab 5: Comparison to Previous Deal**
- **Previous (CBC/TSN 2004-2014):** $1.4B over 10 years = $140M/year
- **Rogers (2014-2026):** $5.2B over 12 years = $433M/year
- **Increase:** 209% higher per year ($433M vs. $140M)
- **Per-game cost:** Previous: $140K/game → Rogers: $433K/game (3x increase)
- **Justification:** Exclusivity premium + digital rights + inflation + NHL's growing Canadian fanbase

**Learning Objectives:**
- **WLO 2.4:** Understand comprehensive scope of rights deal (not just TV games)
- **WLO 2.1:** Recognize valuation factors (exclusivity, platform flexibility, content volume)
- Appreciate why Rogers paid 3x more than previous deal (exclusivity + digital platforms)

### 💡 FINANCIAL ANALYSIS TUTORIAL: How to Read Case Exhibits

**Quick Guide (2 minutes)** - Before you analyze Rogers' performance, learn how to read financial projections like an MBA analyst.

**1. Variance Analysis (Projected vs. Actual)**
- **What it is:** Compare what was forecasted to what actually happened
- **How to calculate:** Variance = Actual - Projected (negative = shortfall, positive = beat expectations)
- **What to look for:** Consistent misses suggest flawed assumptions (not just bad luck)
- **Example:** Rogers projected $500M Year 5 revenue, actual was $350M → -$150M variance (30% shortfall)

**2. Break-Even Analysis**
- **What it is:** When does revenue exceed costs? When does cumulative profit turn positive?
- **Red flag:** Break-even keeps getting pushed back (Year 5 → Year 7 → Never)
- **Rogers reality:** Projected break-even Year 5. Actual: Never achieved after 10 years.

**3. Key Metrics to Track**
- **Revenue growth rate:** Is it accelerating or decelerating?
- **Cost structure:** Are costs fixed or variable? Can they flex down if revenue misses?
- **Cumulative profit/loss:** Add up annual profits/losses to see total financial impact
- **ROI calculation:** (Total Return - Total Investment) / Total Investment

**4. Common Red Flags**
- ⚠️ **Overly optimistic growth rates** (e.g., "subscribers will grow 100%/year for 5 years")
- ⚠️ **No downside scenarios** (what if things go wrong?)
- ⚠️ **Missing force majeure clauses** (COVID, strikes, lockouts)
- ⚠️ **Revenue projections that assume "build it and they will come"** without customer acquisition strategy

**🎯 Use This Framework:** As you explore Rogers' financial data in the next widgets, ask yourself: Where did projections go wrong? What assumptions failed? Could this have been predicted?

### Element 4: Text - Strategic Rationale (150 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# Why Rogers Paid $5.2 Billion: The Strategic Rationale

Rogers' board approved the $5.2B bid despite knowing it would lose money for 3-5 years. **Why?**

## Defensive Strategy: Protect the Core Business
- Cable subscribers were cancelling at 5%/year (cord-cutting accelerating)
- NHL games were **the #1 reason Canadians kept cable** (survey: 42% said "hockey" was must-have)
- Losing NHL rights would accelerate cord-cutting → death spiral for cable business
- **Logic:** Pay $433M/year to prevent $1B+/year cable revenue loss

## Offensive Strategy: Build Streaming Brand
- Sportsnet NOW (streaming service) launched 2016 with NHL as exclusive content
- Target: 1M+ subscribers by Year 5 @ $25/month = $300M/year new revenue
- Position Sportsnet as **Canada's sports streaming destination** before Netflix, DAZN, Apple entered

## Competitive Defense: Hurt TSN (Bell Media)
- TSN (Rogers' main competitor) lost national NHL rights
- Weakened TSN's #1 sports brand positioning
- Rogers could justify cable carriage fee increases ("We have NHL, TSN doesn't")

**Next: What actually happened? (Spoiler: Most assumptions proved wrong)**

- **VTT Transcript:** `week2-rogers-retrospective.vtt` (required)
- **Video Title:** "Rogers NHL Deal: 10 Years Later - What Went Wrong (and Right)"

**Script Content:**

```
[0:00-0:20] Introduction
"In 2013, Rogers bet $5.2 billion on NHL hockey. Ten years later, the deal is widely considered a financial disaster. But was it a complete failure? Let's analyze what went right and wrong."

[0:20-0:45] What Went Wrong
"Three major miscalculations sank profitability:
1. Cord-cutting accelerated faster than projected—cable subscribers declined 28% vs. 15% expected
2. Sportsnet NOW reached only 450K subscribers vs. 1M target—exclusive hockey wasn't enough
3. COVID-19 devastated Year 7 revenue (projected $550M, actual $200M)—no force majeure clause in contract"

[0:45-1:10] What Went Right (Sort Of)
"Rogers DID achieve some strategic goals:
1. Defended cable subscribers—without NHL, decline would've been 35-40% instead of 28%
2. Established Sportsnet as Canada's sports brand—brand value increased despite financial losses
3. Built streaming infrastructure—Sportsnet NOW technology platform now supports other content"

[1:10-1:35] The Financial Reality
"Cumulative losses estimated at $1.5 billion over 10 years. Annual losses: $50-150M/year.
Rogers never achieved profitability. Break-even pushed from Year 5 → Year 7 → Never."

[1:35-2:00] 2026 Decision Ahead
"Contract expires 2026. Rogers must decide: Renew? Renegotiate? Walk away?
NHL knows Rogers overpaid. Next deal will likely be 30-40% less ($300M/year range).
Question: Is NHL still worth it at ANY price given streaming disruption?"

### Element 6: Text - Performance Overview (150 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# What Actually Happened: 2014-2024 Performance

Rogers' optimistic projections collided with harsh market realities.

## Financial Performance (vs. Projections)
- **Year 1:** Revenue $280M (projected $300M) ❌ Below target
- **Year 3:** Revenue $310M (projected $425M) ❌ 27% shortfall
- **Year 5:** Revenue $350M (projected $500M) ❌ 30% shortfall
- **Year 7 (COVID):** Revenue $200M (projected $550M) ❌ 64% shortfall
- **Year 10:** Revenue $380M (projected $600M+) ❌ Still unprofitable

## Three Critical Failures
1. **Advertising Revenue Collapsed:** Cord-cutting reduced linear TV viewership faster than Sportsnet NOW growth offset it
2. **Streaming Underperformance:** 450K subscribers vs. 1M target (55% shortfall) → $150M/year revenue gap
3. **No Flexibility:** Contract had no force majeure clause—COVID losses couldn't be renegotiated

**Cumulative Result:** $1.5B+ total losses over 10 years. Never achieved profitability.

**Next: Explore the data behind these failures.**

### Element 7: Widget 6 - Projections vs. Actuals Visualizer

### ⚙ Interactive Activity: Projections vs. Actuals Visualizer

**Practice: WLO 2.4 (Evaluate Rogers deal performance)**

Rogers projected break-even by Year 5 ($500M revenue). By Year 10, they were still losing $50-150M annually. But where exactly did the projections go wrong? And by how much?

In this interactive activity, you'll scrub through a 10-year timeline (2014-2024) comparing three lines: Rogers' original revenue projections (blue), actual revenue achieved (red), and the break-even threshold at $433M/year (green horizontal line). Hover over any year to see detailed variance breakdowns and key events (e.g., Year 7: COVID-19 devastated revenue, projected $550M, actual $200M, -64% variance).

**What you'll discover:**

- Rogers' projections were optimistic from Day 1—even Year 1 actuals fell short by 15%
- The gap WIDENED over time—by Year 5, actuals were 40% below projections
- COVID-19 wasn't the main problem (though it crushed Year 7)—cord-cutting and failed streaming adoption were
- Rogers NEVER crossed the break-even line in 10 years—losses totaled ~$1.5B

**Time commitment:** 7-8 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** WLO 2.4 (Evaluate mega-deal performance through variance analysis)

## 🎯 FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION

**How This Supports Your Final Strategic Vision:**

The Rogers Gamble: Part 1 analyzed the Rogers/NHL deal structure and rationale. This template applies directly to evaluating media deals for YOUR property in Week 5.

**What You Learned:**
- How to structure billion-dollar media rights deals (term, exclusivity, rights scope, revenue model)
- Strategic rationale for paying premiums (Rogers paid 3× previous deal based on assumptions about streaming growth and hockey's cultural primacy)
- Deal modeling: projected revenue streams vs. costs over 12-year term

**How to Apply This to Your Final Project:**

When you design your 5-year media strategy in Week 5, The Rogers Gamble: Part 1's deal structure framework guides your approach:

- **Rights Package Definition:** Define what your property offers media partners. Example: "Our property offers exclusive domestic streaming rights + non-exclusive linear broadcast rights, following Rogers' hybrid model but learning from their overreliance on exclusivity."
- **Valuation Justification:** Rogers' $5.2B valuation assumed specific audience/engagement metrics. Your vision must justify media rights value using similar frameworks: audience size × engagement × demographics × exclusivity premium.
- **Risk Assessment:** The Rogers Gamble: Part 1 showed Rogers' optimistic assumptions. Your vision should stress-test assumptions: "What if streaming subscribers grow 50% slower than projected? What if cord-cutting accelerates?"

**Real-World Application:** The Rogers case is a cautionary tale. Your Week 5 capstone must avoid Rogers' mistakes: overoptimistic projections, insufficient flexibility, underestimating disruption.

### Element 8: Infobox (Note) - Key Insight: Why Forecasts Failed

```
Title: ▶ Critical Insight: The Forecasting Failure

Rogers' projections failed for three interconnected reasons:

1. **Underestimated Cord-Cutting Speed**
   - Assumed linear TV would decline 15% over 10 years
   - Actual: 28% decline (nearly double)
   - Impact: $150M/year advertising revenue shortfall

2. **Overestimated Streaming Adoption**
   - Assumed NHL-only service would attract 1M+ subscribers
   - Actual: Hockey alone wasn't enough—fans wanted multi-sport (DAZN model)
   - Impact: $150M/year subscription revenue shortfall

3. **No Scenario Planning for Black Swan Events**
   - Contract had no force majeure clause (COVID, lockouts, other disruptions)
   - Impact: $350M loss in Year 7 with no recourse

**Lesson:** Media rights deals require scenario planning. Rogers optimized for "base case" and had no hedge for downside risks. NHL's next deal will include flexibility clauses.

### Element 9: Text - Audience Trends (150 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# Viewership Trends: The Audience Story

Beyond financial projections, Rogers faced declining and fragmented audiences.

## National Broadcast Ratings (Hockey Night in Canada)
- **2013-14 (Pre-Rogers):** 1.8M average viewers (baseline)
- **2014-15 (Year 1):** 1.6M viewers (-11%) ⬇️ Weak Canadian teams
- **2023-24 (Year 10):** 1.3M viewers (-28% vs. baseline) ⬇️ Continued erosion

## Why Viewership Declined
1. **Canadian Team Performance:** Only 1-2 Canadian teams made playoffs most years (reduces "must-watch" games)
2. **Generational Shift:** Younger audiences (18-34) prefer highlights and social clips over 3-hour games
3. **Competition:** More viewing options (Netflix, gaming, other sports) fragment attention

## Sportsnet NOW Subscriber Growth (Too Slow)
- **2016 (Launch):** 50K subscribers
- **2020 (Target Year 5):** 350K subscribers (vs. 1M target)
- **2024 (Current):** 450K subscribers ⬆️ Growth stalled

**Lesson:** Exclusive content isn't enough if underlying audience is declining. Rogers needed multi-sport strategy like DAZN.

**Next: Explore viewership data interactively.**

### Element 10: Widget 7 - Viewership Trends Analyzer

### ⚙ Interactive Activity: Viewership Trends Analyzer

**Practice: WLO 2.3 (Understand fan engagement challenges) & WLO 2.4 (Analyze market dynamics)**

Rogers lost $1.5B on the NHL deal. But what were the underlying AUDIENCE trends driving those losses? Did viewership decline? Did younger fans stop watching? Did streaming adoption stall?

In this interactive activity, you'll explore 3 tabs of audience data: (1) Linear TV Ratings showing Hockey Night in Canada's Saturday night viewership from 2014-2024, (2) Sportsnet NOW Subscribers tracking streaming growth vs. Rogers' 1M target, and (3) Demographic Breakdown revealing which age groups, genders, and regions engaged—and which didn't. Filter by year, hover for details, and identify the trends Rogers missed.

**What you'll discover:**

- Hockey Night in Canada ratings declined 35% over 10 years—steady erosion, not sudden collapse
- Sportsnet NOW peaked at 450K subscribers (55% short of target)—hockey alone wasn't a streaming driver
- Viewers aged 18-34 declined 50% while 55+ held steady—aging audience crisis
- Regional disparities: Toronto/Montreal strong, Vancouver/Calgary declining—not all Canadian markets equal

**Time commitment:** 8-9 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** WLO 2.3 (Fan engagement patterns), WLO 2.4 (Market trend analysis)

# The Competitive Landscape: TSN, DAZN, and New Entrants

While Rogers struggled with the NHL deal, competitors evolved with diversified strategies.

## TSN (Bell Media): The Diversification Winner
- **Lost:** NHL national rights to Rogers (painful in 2014)
- **Pivoted:** Acquired CFL, NBA, FIFA World Cup, MLS regional, curling, tennis
- **Result:** Multi-sport strategy created stable revenue (no single property = 50% of costs)
- **TSN Direct (streaming):** Launched 2018, reached 400K subscribers by 2024 (vs. Sportsnet NOW 450K)

## DAZN Canada: The Disruptor
- **Launched:** 2017 with soccer (EPL, Champions League, Serie A) + boxing + NFL
- **Strategy:** Lower price ($24.99 vs. Sportsnet $27.99), multi-sport, niche fan targeting
- **Subscribers:** 300K by 2020 (competitive with Sportsnet NOW despite later launch)

## Apple TV+ / Amazon: The Tech Giants
- **Apple:** MLS exclusive deal ($2.5B, 2023-2032) → Global strategy, not ROI-focused
- **Amazon:** NFL Thursday Night Football → Subscription driver for Prime

**Lesson:** Rogers' single-property bet looked increasingly risky as market fragmented and tech giants entered with deep pockets.

**Next: Compare Rogers' strategy to competitors.**
```

### Element 12: Table - Rogers vs. Competitors Comparison

| **Company** | **Rights Portfolio** | **Annual Rights Costs** | **Streaming Strategy** | **2024 Subscribers** | **Profitability** | **Strategic Approach** |
|------------|---------------------|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Rogers (Sportsnet)** | NHL exclusive | $433M/year | Sportsnet NOW (NHL-only) | 450K | ❌ Unprofitable (10 years) | Single-property bet, defensive strategy |
| **Bell (TSN)** | Multi-sport (CFL, NBA, FIFA, MLS) | $250M/year total | TSN Direct (multi-sport) | 400K | ✅ Profitable Year 3 | Diversification, lower risk |
| **DAZN Canada** | Soccer, boxing, NFL, combat sports | $50M/year | DAZN multi-sport | 300K | ✅ Profitable Year 4 | Niche targeting, global content |
| **Apple TV+** | MLS exclusive (global) | $250M/year | Apple TV+ bundle | 2M+ (MLS Season Pass) | ❌ Strategic investment (not ROI-focused) | Tech giant deep pockets, global strategy |

**Table Caption:** "Canadian Sports Streaming Competitive Landscape (2024)"

**Key Takeaway:**
Rogers' single-property, NHL-exclusive strategy created concentration risk. TSN's multi-sport portfolio and DAZN's niche targeting proved more resilient. Tech giants (Apple, Amazon) can afford "strategic losses" that traditional broadcasters cannot.

### Element 13: Text - The 2026 Decision (150 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# 2026: Renew, Renegotiate, or Walk Away?

Rogers' NHL contract expires after the 2025-26 season. The company must decide its next move.

## Three Options on the Table

**Option 1: Renew at Reduced Price**
- NHL knows Rogers overpaid and lost money
- Next deal likely $300-350M/year (30% reduction)
- **Pros:** Keep NHL content, spread costs over longer term (15 years?), flexibility clauses (force majeure)
- **Cons:** Still a massive bet, streaming market even more competitive, younger demos not watching full games

**Option 2: Split Rights Package**
- Rogers takes regional (7 Canadian teams) + streaming
- TSN or Amazon takes national (Saturday nights)
- **Pros:** Lower cost ($200M/year range), shared risk, broader distribution
- **Cons:** Lose exclusivity competitive advantage, coordination challenges

**Option 3: Walk Away Completely**
- Let TSN, DAZN, Apple, or Amazon bid for NHL
- Rogers focuses on other sports or exits sports media
- **Pros:** Cut losses, reallocate capital, focus on wireless/cable core business
- **Cons:** Lose sports brand identity, accelerate cable cord-cutting (NHL was subscriber retention tool)

**Your Task:** What would YOU recommend? Use the decision simulator to explore trade-offs.

### Element 14: Widget 8 - 2026 Decision Simulator (CAPSTONE)

### ⚙ CAPSTONE Activity: 2026 Decision Simulator

**Synthesis: ALL 4 WLOs (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4) — This is your Week 2 capstone**

The year is 2026. Rogers' $5.2 billion NHL contract expires. After losing $1.5 billion over 12 years, Rogers CEO asks you: "Should we renew? If so, at what price and on what terms? Or should we walk away?" There's no "right" answer—only defensible strategic recommendations supported by evidence.

This capstone simulation integrates EVERYTHING you've learned in Week 2. You'll set market assumptions (cord-cutting rate, streaming growth, NHL viewership trends, competitive intensity, betting revenue), choose from 3 options (renew exclusive $300-350M/year, split package $200M/year, or walk away), view 10-year financial projections for your choice, compare alternatives side-by-side, and write an executive recommendation (250 words) justifying your decision. Export your full analysis as PDF.

**What this capstone tests:**

- **WLO 2.1:** Can you value NHL rights in 2026 given changed market conditions? (Apply frameworks from Widgets 1-2)
- **WLO 2.2:** Can you evaluate platform strategies (exclusive vs. split vs. exit)? (Apply economics from Widget 3)
- **WLO 2.3:** Can you assess fan engagement opportunities (betting, apps, exclusive content)? (Apply insights from Widget 4)
- **WLO 2.4:** Can you synthesize financial, competitive, and strategic factors into ONE coherent recommendation? (Demonstrate Bloom's Synthesis/Evaluation level)

**Time commitment:** 15-20 minutes (most complex widget, highest pedagogical value)
**Learning outcomes synthesized:** ALL Week 2 WLOs (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4)

**Note:** This is Week 2's capstone demonstration of mastery. Your recommendation will inform your Week 2 reflection memo.

---

### 🤖 AI CASE ANALYSIS COACH

**AI Chat Widget Configuration** - Available throughout The Rogers Gamble to guide your case analysis thinking

**Widget Name:** "Rogers Case Analysis Coach"

**Purpose:** Provide Socratic guidance for case analysis without giving direct answers. Help students apply frameworks, develop evidence-based reasoning, and prepare for their Mini-Case Memo.

**System Prompt:**
```
You are a case analysis coach for MBA students working on the Rogers NHL rights deal case study. Your role is to ask probing Socratic questions that help students think critically, NOT to provide direct answers or write content for them.

When students ask for help:
1. Ask clarifying questions: "What data have you looked at? What patterns do you notice?"
2. Point them to relevant frameworks: "Have you applied the rights valuation framework from The Billion-Dollar Core Product? How do the 5 factors play out here?"
3. Challenge assumptions: "You said Rogers made a mistake. What evidence supports that? Could there be another interpretation?"
4. Help structure thinking: "Let's break this down. What were Rogers' goals? What actually happened? Where's the gap?"
5. Encourage synthesis: "You've identified three mistakes. How do they connect? Is there a pattern?"

DO NOT:
- Write memo content for students
- Provide direct answers to case questions
- Give "the right answer" (there isn't one)
- Do financial calculations for them (teach them HOW instead)

DO:
- Ask "why" and "how" questions
- Reference specific data points from widgets: "Look at the Widget 6 variance data. What do you notice about Year 5?"
- Connect to Week 2 frameworks: "How does this relate to platform economics we learned in The Billion-Dollar Core Product?"
- Help students develop confidence in their reasoning: "That's a solid insight. What evidence would make it even stronger?"

Tone: Supportive but challenging. Like a good professor during office hours.
```

**Welcome Message:**
"Hi! I'm here to help you think through the Rogers case analysis. I won't write your memo, but I'll ask questions to help you develop stronger arguments. What aspect of the case are you working on?"

**Show System Prompt to User:** No

**Uplimit Implementation Notes:**
- Place widget at end of The Rogers Gamble (after Element 15)
- Make available as optional support tool
- Students can access anytime during The Rogers Gamble work
- Widget persists conversation (students can come back)

**Sample Interactions:**

**Student:** "What should I say about Rogers' mistakes?"
**Coach:** "Great question! Let's think this through together. First, what data have you explored? Have you looked at the Widget 6 financial projections vs. actuals? What patterns jump out at you?"

**Student:** "I think Rogers overpaid"
**Coach:** "Interesting perspective. What does 'overpaid' mean to you? Compared to what benchmark? Walk me through your reasoning."

**Student:** "I'm stuck on the 2026 recommendation"
**Coach:** "Let's break this down. What are Rogers' options? For each option, what would you need to believe for it to be the right choice? Which assumptions seem most realistic given what you've learned?"

## 🌟 MENTAL BREAK #4: Prepare to Write (CRITICAL BREAK)

**You've completed:** ALL Week 2 learning content (framework + simulation + case)
**Coming next:** Mini-Case Memo assessment (2-page written analysis)

**Take a moment to:**
- **Stand and walk for 5 minutes** (critical for mental clarity before writing)
- Stretch your neck, shoulders, and wrists
- Get water, use the restroom, grab a snack
- Review your notes from the Rogers case
- Set up your writing environment (quiet space, no distractions)

**Progress:** You're 90% through Week 2! You've learned media valuation frameworks, simulated platform strategy, and analyzed a real $5.2B deal. Now you'll synthesize everything into an executive memo.

*DO NOT SKIP THIS BREAK. Writing requires fresh mental energy. Take at least 5-10 minutes. Consider this your "pre-game" before the assessment. You've got this!*

**Pro tip:** Before you start writing, take 2 minutes to jot down your 3 main points on scratch paper. This roadmap will make your memo stronger.

## 🎯 FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION

**How This Supports Your Final Strategic Vision:**

The Rogers Gamble: Part 2 analyzed Rogers' performance failures and 2026 decision. This post-mortem analysis teaches risk management for your Week 5 capstone.

**What You Learned:**
- What went wrong: advertising collapsed, streaming underperformed, no contractual flexibility for black swan events (COVID)
- How to evaluate strategic mistakes using data (projected vs. actual variance analysis)
- Strategic decision frameworks for renewing, renegotiating, or exiting media deals

**How to Apply This to Your Final Project:**

When you craft your 5-year strategic vision in Week 5, The Rogers Gamble: Part 2's failure analysis informs your risk management:

- **Scenario Planning:** Rogers assumed linear decline would be gradual. Your vision must include downside scenarios. Example: "If cord-cutting accelerates 2× faster than baseline, our media revenue declines from $500M (Year 1) to $300M (Year 5). Mitigation: diversify into DTC and retain 30% revenue from non-media streams."
- **Contractual Flexibility:** Rogers had no force majeure clause. Your vision should specify deal terms that protect downside: "Seek performance-based revenue share vs. guaranteed fees, with renegotiation triggers if viewership declines >20%."
- **Post-Investment Review:** The Rogers Gamble: Part 2 taught how to evaluate deals ex-post. Your vision should include monitoring KPIs and decision points: "If streaming subs <500K by Year 2, pivot from DTC to licensing model."

**Real-World Application:** Rogers lost $1.5B+ over 10 years. Your Week 5 capstone must demonstrate you've learned from their mistakes: conservative projections, downside protection, strategic flexibility.

• Mistake 2: [What went wrong]. Evidence: [specific number from case].
• Mistake 3: [What went wrong]. Evidence: [comparison or variance].
```

**AI Feedback Configuration:**
- ✅ Enable AI feedback
- **Feedback Prompt:** "Review this student's 3 key mistakes. For each mistake: (1) Confirm if it's evidence-based and specific, (2) Ask if they can quantify the impact (e.g., revenue shortfall, subscriber gap), (3) Suggest one deeper question they should consider. Be encouraging but push for precision. Example: 'Good start! For Mistake #2, you identified streaming underperformance. Can you quantify the subscriber gap? Widget 6 shows the exact numbers—what percentage did Rogers miss their target by?'"
- **Points:** 5 points (participation credit, not graded rigorously)
- **Purpose:** Build confidence, get students comfortable analyzing data

---

### Element 3: Micro-Step 2 - Deal Evaluation (Text Response)

**Question Text:**
```
MICRO-STEP 2: Evaluate the Deal

Write 1 paragraph (100-150 words) evaluating whether Rogers' $5.2B investment was justified.

Apply Week 2 frameworks:
• Media rights valuation framework (WLO 2.1): Did Rogers properly value audience size, exclusivity, platform flexibility?
• Platform economics (WLO 2.2): Did the linear TV + streaming strategy make sense?
• Fan engagement (WLO 2.3): Did Rogers effectively monetize beyond rights fees?

Was the deal justified given Rogers' strategic goals (defend cable, build Sportsnet brand, enter streaming)?
```

**AI Feedback Configuration:**
- ✅ Enable AI feedback
- **Feedback Prompt:** "Review this student's deal evaluation paragraph. Check: (1) Did they apply at least 2 Week 2 frameworks? (2) Did they distinguish between financial ROI and strategic value? (3) Is their evaluation nuanced (acknowledging both successes and failures)? Provide specific feedback. Example: 'Strong use of the valuation framework! You mentioned exclusivity as a key factor. Now, can you add the platform economics lens? How did Rogers' linear + streaming strategy compare to what you learned in the Streaming Wars simulation? Would a multi-sport approach (like DAZN) have been smarter?'"
- **Points:** 5 points (participation credit)
- **Purpose:** Ensure students apply frameworks, not just opinionate

---

### Element 4: Micro-Step 3 - 2026 Recommendation (Text Response)

**Question Text:**
```
MICRO-STEP 3: 2026 Strategic Recommendation

Write 1 paragraph (100-150 words) recommending what Rogers should do in 2026 when the NHL deal expires.

Choose ONE option and defend it:
• Option 1: Renew exclusive rights (at what price?)
• Option 2: Renegotiate for split package with competitors
• Option 3: Walk away entirely

Your recommendation should:
• State your chosen option clearly
• Provide 2-3 reasons with evidence
• Acknowledge the risks/trade-offs of your choice
• Reference market dynamics (competitors, streaming trends, viewership data)
```

**AI Feedback Configuration:**
- ✅ Enable AI feedback
- **Feedback Prompt:** "Review this student's 2026 recommendation. Check: (1) Is their recommendation clear and specific? (2) Did they provide evidence-based reasons? (3) Did they acknowledge risks/trade-offs? (4) Did they consider competitive landscape and market trends? Provide constructive feedback. Example: 'Clear recommendation! You chose Option 2 (split package). Strong reasons about cost reduction and risk management. Now, what's your Plan B if the NHL refuses to split rights? Also, you mentioned TSN as a potential partner—what makes that partnership viable given the competitive history? Widget 7's competitor data might help you strengthen this argument.'"
- **Points:** 5 points (participation credit)
- **Purpose:** Force students to commit to a position before final memo (builds conviction)

### Details - Rubric Examples Content:
```
Title: Rubric Details & Example Excerpts

[Expand to see evaluation criteria and examples]

## Deal Evaluation (12 points)

**Excellent (11-12 pts):**
"Applies multiple Week 2 frameworks systematically. Evaluates deal using rights valuation
drivers (audience, exclusivity, volume, brand, strategy fit), platform economics (linear
vs. streaming profitability timelines), and fan engagement monetization. Demonstrates
nuanced understanding of Rogers' strategic rationale vs. financial outcomes."

**Example Excerpt:**
"Rogers' $5.2B valuation assumed three critical drivers: (1) Hockey's enduring Canadian
audience would resist cord-cutting trends [Valuation Driver: Audience], (2) Exclusive
rights would create insurmountable competitive moat [Driver: Exclusivity], and (3)
Sportsnet NOW streaming would achieve 1M+ subscribers by Year 5 at $25/month [Platform
Economics: Subscription revenue]. All three assumptions proved overly optimistic. Actual
streaming subscribers reached only 450K (Exhibit B), advertising revenue declined 33%
due to faster-than-expected cord-cutting, and TSN's diversification strategy proved more
resilient than Rogers anticipated..."

**Proficient (9-10 pts):**
"Applies Week 2 frameworks with some analysis. Evaluates deal using several relevant
concepts. May miss some nuances or fail to integrate all frameworks systematically."

**Developing (6-8 pts):**
"References Week 2 concepts but application is superficial. Evaluation lacks depth or
specificity. May focus on one framework and ignore others."

**Needs Improvement (0-5 pts):**
"Minimal or no application of Week 2 frameworks. Evaluation is purely opinion-based
without supporting analysis."

---

## Mistake Identification (10 points)

**Excellent (9-10 pts):**
"Identifies 2-3 specific, insightful mistakes supported by exhibit data. Goes beyond
obvious errors to reveal strategic misjudgments. Analysis is evidence-based."

**Example Excerpt:**
"Rogers made three critical mistakes: (1) **Overestimated the 'Canadian exceptionalism'
of hockey** - assumed cord-cutting would spare sports fans, but Exhibit A shows ad revenue
declined faster than U.S. trends; (2) **Failed to build differentiated engagement beyond
live games** - Sportsnet NOW was pure streaming with minimal fantasy, social, or interactive
features (contrast with DAZN's multi-sport strategy), leading to high churn; (3) **No
flexibility clause for black swan events** - COVID devastated Year 7 revenue (Exhibit A:
$200M vs. projected $550M) with no force majeure protection in the contract."

**Proficient (7-8 pts):**
"Identifies 2-3 reasonable mistakes with some supporting evidence. Analysis is solid
but may lack depth or miss less obvious strategic errors."

```

### AI Chat Widget Configuration:
- **Widget Name:** "Rogers Case Analysis Coach"
- **System Prompt:** "You are a helpful case analysis coach for MBA students. Provide guidance on analyzing the Rogers NHL case study. Do NOT write content for students. Instead, ask probing questions to help them think critically: What does this data point tell you? How does this connect to the frameworks from readings? What are the underlying assumptions? Focus on: case analysis methodology, framework application, evidence-based reasoning, and strategic thinking. If students ask you to write their memo, redirect them to develop their own analysis with your guidance."
- **Welcome Message:** "Hi! I'm here to coach you through your Rogers case analysis. I won't write your memo, but I'll ask questions to help you develop stronger arguments. What aspect of the case are you working on?"
- **Show System Prompt:** No

**Design Rationale:**
- **Text Response with rubric** measures analytical and evaluative thinking (Bloom's Analysis/Evaluation)
- **Infobox** provides crystal-clear instructions and expectations (QM Standard 3)
- **Rubric** ensures transparent, consistent evaluation (QM Standard 3, UDL clarity)
- **AI grading** enables timely feedback at scale with quality maintenance
- **Details** makes rubric fully transparent with examples (students know exactly what excellence looks like)
- **AI Chat Coach** serves as your thinking partner during case analysis—use it to test your arguments, clarify framework application, or structure your reasoning (UDL scaffolding + active learning)
- Authentic consulting task (executive memo format) mirrors real-world practice
- Word limit ensures concision and prioritization (executive communication skill)
- Measures all 4 WLOs comprehensively in integrated assessment

## 🎯 FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION

**How This Supports Your Final Strategic Vision:**

Your Media Strategy Memo is practice for your Week 5 capstone assessment. You've now written an executive-level strategic analysis synthesizing Week 2 frameworks.

**What You Learned:**
- How to evaluate billion-dollar deals using multiple frameworks (rights valuation, platform economics, engagement, strategic fit)
- How to identify strategic mistakes with evidence (not opinions)
- How to recommend next steps with explicit trade-off analysis
- How to write concisely for executive audiences (500-750 words)

**How to Apply This to Your Final Project:**

When you write your 5-year strategic vision in Week 5, Your Media Strategy Memo's structure becomes your template:

- **Analytical Rigor:** Your capstone requires the same evidence-based analysis you practiced here. Every claim needs data/framework support: "Rogers' mistake was X (evidence: Exhibit A shows Y variance). Our property avoids this by Z strategy."
- **Trade-Off Clarity:** Your Media Strategy Memo forced you to weigh renew vs. renegotiate vs. exit. Week 5 will require similar decision frameworks: build vs. license, DTC vs. linear, exclusive vs. non-exclusive.
- **Executive Communication:** The memo format you practiced—situation analysis → evaluation → recommendation → rationale—is exactly what your Week 5 capstone requires. Scale it from 750 words to 2,000 words.
- **Peer + AI Review:** You used AI feedback and peer review in Your Media Strategy Memo. Apply the same iterative improvement process to your Week 5 capstone.

**Real-World Application:** The Mini-Case Memo you wrote mirrors the strategy documents executives submit to boards for multi-million dollar decisions. Your Week 5 capstone scales this skill to a comprehensive 5-year vision.

You've completed your deep dive into media rights and fan monetization! Here's what
you should take away:

✓ Sports remain "appointment viewing" in an on-demand world—this drives premium valuations
✓ Streaming economics differ fundamentally from linear TV (LTV vs. immediate ROI)
✓ Fan engagement monetization extends beyond passive viewing (data, sponsorship, retention)
✓ Mega-deals like Rogers/NHL require scenario planning and flexibility—disruption happens

This foundation prepares you for Week 3, where we'll explore the fastest-growing revenue
streams: sponsorship activation and sports betting integration.

Plus: This week you'll form your Anchor Project team and select your sport property!

Well done! 👏

### Details Content - Anchor Project FAQs:
```
Title: ◆ Anchor Project FAQs

[Expand for answers to common questions]

**Q: How many team members should we have?**
A: 5-6 students is ideal. Fewer than 5 makes workload challenging; more than 6 creates
coordination overhead.

**Q: Can we choose a property not on the list?**
A: Yes, with instructor approval. Your property must: (1) Have sufficient public data
available, (2) Present clear marketing challenges, (3) Be a professional or semi-pro
organization (not amateur/recreational). Submit your proposal for approval.

**Q: What if our chosen property is also chosen by another team?**
A: That's fine! Different teams will develop different strategies for the same property.
This mirrors real consulting competitions.

**Q: How much time should we invest in the Anchor Project each week?**
A: Week 2: 2-3 hours (team formation, property selection)
   Week 3: 2-3 hours (revenue model development)
   Week 4: 3-4 hours (brand strategy, competitive analysis)
   Week 5: 4-6 hours (final presentation preparation)

**Q: What if a team member isn't contributing?**
A: Your Team Charter should include accountability mechanisms. If issues persist, use
your conflict resolution process. As a last resort, contact the instructor. Peer
evaluations in Week 5 will account for individual contributions.

**Q: Can we interview executives at our chosen property?**
A: Absolutely! Original research strengthens your project. If you conduct interviews,
include key insights and quotes in your final presentation.

**Q: What resources are available beyond the tools?**
A: Each week provides readings, frameworks, and templates. Use office hours for team
check-ins. The AI chat assistants can help with specific questions. Discussion forums
are great for crowdsourcing ideas from other teams.

## 🎯 FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION

**How Week 2 Supports Your Final Strategic Vision:**

Week 2 taught you how to evaluate and design media rights strategies—the largest revenue stream (40-60%) for most sports properties. This expertise is central to your Week 5 capstone.

**What You Mastered:**
- Media rights valuation frameworks (audience × demographics × exclusivity × platform reach)
- Platform economics (linear advertising vs. streaming subscription models)
- Deal structure and negotiation (term, exclusivity, revenue models, flexibility clauses)
- Performance evaluation (projected vs. actual analysis, mistake identification, strategic pivots)

**How to Apply This to Your Final Project:**

Your Week 5 strategic vision must integrate Week 2's media frameworks comprehensively:

- **Media Rights Section (likely 30-40% of your capstone):** This is your property's largest revenue stream. Use Week 2's valuation tools, platform comparison frameworks, and deal structure templates to design a sophisticated 5-year media strategy.
- **Integration with Other Weeks:** Media strategy connects to everything: Week 1 (ecosystem effects), Week 3 (sponsorship amplification through media), Week 4 (athlete brand exposure via media), Week 5 (heritage vs. innovation in media approach).
- **Real Numbers:** Your vision needs quantitative projections. Use Week 2's widgets and case data to benchmark realistic media rights valuations for your property.

**Integration Across All Weeks:**
- Week 1 = Revenue ecosystem foundation
- **Week 2 = Media rights specialization (40-60% of revenue)**
- Week 3 = Sponsorship/betting specialization
- Week 4 = Athlete brand specialization
- Week 5 = Synthesis into 5-year vision

**Real-World Application:** Media strategy is the foundation of modern sports economics. Your Week 5 capstone must demonstrate mastery of this domain—Week 2 provided the technical toolkit.
