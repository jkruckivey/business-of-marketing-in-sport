Title: Week 2 Learning Objectives 📺

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
• MLO 2.1: Explore how media rights deals are valued and monetized
• MLO 2.2: Compare linear broadcasting to streaming/DTC models
• MLO 2.3: Understand fan engagement monetization strategies

This week focuses on CLO 2: Evaluating Media & Fan Monetization
```

### Text Content (week2-intro.docx):
```
Media Rights: The Billion-Dollar Core Product

In Week 1, you learned that media rights represent 40-60% of total revenue for major
professional leagues. This week, we examine WHY sports content commands such premium
valuations and HOW rights deals are structured, negotiated, and monetized.

Sports remain the last "appointment viewing" in an era of on-demand entertainment.
Live games can't be spoiled by social media or watched later without losing cultural
currency. This unique characteristic makes sports the most valuable programming for
traditional broadcasters defending against cord-cutting—and the most expensive content
for streaming platforms trying to acquire subscribers.

You'll analyze the Rogers Communications / NHL deal: $5.2 billion over 12 years for
exclusive Canadian rights. Was it worth it? How do you value something this complex?
What did Rogers get wrong—and what did they get right? By week's end, you'll understand
media economics well enough to evaluate mega-deals yourself and recommend platform
strategies for sports properties.
```

### Infobox (Note) Content:
```
Title: Key Insight: "Appointment Viewing" in an On-Demand World 📺

Sports are the last true appointment viewing. You can't watch a game "later" without
risking spoilers from social media, friends, or news alerts. This creates:

• Predictable, simultaneous audience (rare in 2024)
• Premium advertising rates (live = engaged = valuable)
• Subscription retention power (can't cancel during season)
• Cultural currency ("Did you see that play?")

This unique characteristic explains why sports rights command prices that seem
economically irrational—until you understand their strategic defensive value for
traditional broadcasters and offensive value for streaming disruptors.

Title: 💡 Strategic Considerations (Open if you're stuck)

Not sure how to approach this simulation? Here are some frameworks:

**Customer Lifetime Value (LTV):**
How long will subscribers stay? If average subscriber stays 18 months at $19.99/month,
their LTV is ~$360. How much can you spend to acquire them? How much on content to
retain them?

**Content Portfolio Strategy:**
• Anchor Properties: High-cost, broad appeal (e.g., NHL, NBA) - drive subscriptions
• Niche Properties: Lower-cost, targeted appeal (e.g., esports, rugby) - reduce churn
• Emerging Properties: Speculative bets (e.g., women's sports, new leagues) - differentiation

**The Streaming Profitability Paradox:**
Growth requires spending on content AND customer acquisition. Profitability requires
reducing both. Most streaming services lose money for 3-5 years building scale.

**Pricing Strategy:**
• Too low: Can't cover content costs, perceived as low-quality
• Too high: Small addressable market, high churn risk
• Sweet spot: Premium enough to signal quality, accessible enough for mass market

**Rights Negotiation:**
• Exclusive rights cost 2-3x more than non-exclusive
• Multi-year deals lock in costs but reduce flexibility
• Regional rights (Canada-only) cheaper than global but smaller audience

**Engagement Investments:**
Beyond just streaming games, consider: interactive features, fantasy integration,
social viewing, original content (documentaries, shoulder programming).
These reduce churn but add costs.

**Key Question:**
What is your differentiation? Why do subscribers choose YOU over competitors?

Title: Case Study: Rogers Communications - The $5.2 Billion NHL Bet 🏒📺

Context:
In 2013, Rogers Communications shocked the sports media world by paying $5.2 billion
for exclusive Canadian NHL rights—12 years, all platforms, all games. It was the
largest sports media deal in Canadian history and a massive strategic bet on hockey's
enduring value.

Key Questions for Analysis:
1. How did Rogers value the NHL rights at $5.2 billion? What assumptions did they make?
2. What were the strategic goals beyond pure ROI (e.g., brand positioning, competitive defense)?
3. How did the deal perform vs. expectations? What went right and wrong?
4. Would you have made this deal? What would you have done differently?

This case addresses all Week 2 MLOs:
• MLO 2.1: Rights valuation methodology
• MLO 2.2: Platform strategy (linear Sportsnet + streaming)
• MLO 2.3: Fan engagement and monetization tactics
• MLO 2.4: Evaluation of mega-deal success/failure

Preparation: Read the full case and all exhibits. Watch the retrospective video.

### Details - Rubric Examples Content:
```
Title: Rubric Details & Example Excerpts

[Expand to see evaluation criteria and examples]

## Deal Evaluation (12 points)

**Excellent (11-12 pts):**
"Applies multiple Week 2 frameworks systematically. Evaluates deal using rights valuation
drivers (audience, exclusivity, volume, brand, strategy fit), platform economics (linear
vs. streaming profitability timelines), and fan engagement monetization. Demonstrates
nuanced understanding of Rogers' strategic rationale vs. financial outcomes."

**Example Excerpt:**
"Rogers' $5.2B valuation assumed three critical drivers: (1) Hockey's enduring Canadian
audience would resist cord-cutting trends [Valuation Driver: Audience], (2) Exclusive
rights would create insurmountable competitive moat [Driver: Exclusivity], and (3)
Sportsnet NOW streaming would achieve 1M+ subscribers by Year 5 at $25/month [Platform
Economics: Subscription revenue]. All three assumptions proved overly optimistic. Actual
streaming subscribers reached only 450K (Exhibit B), advertising revenue declined 33%
due to faster-than-expected cord-cutting, and TSN's diversification strategy proved more
resilient than Rogers anticipated..."

**Proficient (9-10 pts):**
"Applies Week 2 frameworks with some analysis. Evaluates deal using several relevant
concepts. May miss some nuances or fail to integrate all frameworks systematically."

**Developing (6-8 pts):**
"References Week 2 concepts but application is superficial. Evaluation lacks depth or
specificity. May focus on one framework and ignore others."

**Needs Improvement (0-5 pts):**
"Minimal or no application of Week 2 frameworks. Evaluation is purely opinion-based
without supporting analysis."

---

## Mistake Identification (10 points)

**Excellent (9-10 pts):**
"Identifies 2-3 specific, insightful mistakes supported by exhibit data. Goes beyond
obvious errors to reveal strategic misjudgments. Analysis is evidence-based."

**Example Excerpt:**
"Rogers made three critical mistakes: (1) **Overestimated the 'Canadian exceptionalism'
of hockey** - assumed cord-cutting would spare sports fans, but Exhibit A shows ad revenue
declined faster than U.S. trends; (2) **Failed to build differentiated engagement beyond
live games** - Sportsnet NOW was pure streaming with minimal fantasy, social, or interactive
features (contrast with DAZN's multi-sport strategy), leading to high churn; (3) **No
flexibility clause for black swan events** - COVID devastated Year 7 revenue (Exhibit A:
$200M vs. projected $550M) with no force majeure protection in the contract."

**Proficient (7-8 pts):**
"Identifies 2-3 reasonable mistakes with some supporting evidence. Analysis is solid
but may lack depth or miss less obvious strategic errors."

Title: 🎯 Week 2 Key Takeaways

You've completed your deep dive into media rights and fan monetization! Here's what
you should take away:

✓ Sports remain "appointment viewing" in an on-demand world—this drives premium valuations
✓ Streaming economics differ fundamentally from linear TV (LTV vs. immediate ROI)
✓ Fan engagement monetization extends beyond passive viewing (data, sponsorship, retention)
✓ Mega-deals like Rogers/NHL require scenario planning and flexibility—disruption happens

This foundation prepares you for Week 3, where we'll explore the fastest-growing revenue
streams: sponsorship activation and sports betting integration.

Plus: This week you'll form your Anchor Project team and select your sport property!

Well done! 👏

### Details Content - Anchor Project FAQs:
```
Title: 🤔 Anchor Project FAQs

[Expand for answers to common questions]

**Q: How many team members should we have?**
A: 5-6 students is ideal. Fewer than 5 makes workload challenging; more than 6 creates
coordination overhead.

**Q: Can we choose a property not on the list?**
A: Yes, with instructor approval. Your property must: (1) Have sufficient public data
available, (2) Present clear marketing challenges, (3) Be a professional or semi-pro
organization (not amateur/recreational). Submit your proposal for approval.

**Q: What if our chosen property is also chosen by another team?**
A: That's fine! Different teams will develop different strategies for the same property.
This mirrors real consulting competitions.

**Q: How much time should we invest in the Anchor Project each week?**
A: Week 2: 2-3 hours (team formation, property selection)
   Week 3: 2-3 hours (revenue model development)
   Week 4: 3-4 hours (brand strategy, competitive analysis)
   Week 5: 4-6 hours (final presentation preparation)

**Q: What if a team member isn't contributing?**
A: Your Team Charter should include accountability mechanisms. If issues persist, use
your conflict resolution process. As a last resort, contact the instructor. Peer
evaluations in Week 5 will account for individual contributions.

**Q: Can we interview executives at our chosen property?**
A: Absolutely! Original research strengthens your project. If you conduct interviews,
include key insights and quotes in your final presentation.

**Q: What resources are available beyond the tools?**
A: Each week provides readings, frameworks, and templates. Use office hours for team
check-ins. The AI chat assistants can help with specific questions. Discussion forums
are great for crowdsourcing ideas from other teams.
