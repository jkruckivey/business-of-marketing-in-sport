Title: Week 2 Learning Objectives ‚óâ

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
‚Ä¢ MLO 2.1: Explore how media rights deals are valued and monetized
‚Ä¢ MLO 2.2: Compare linear broadcasting to streaming/DTC models
‚Ä¢ MLO 2.3: Understand fan engagement monetization strategies
‚Ä¢ MLO 2.4: Evaluate the Rogers $5.2B NHL deal and its implications

This week focuses on CLO 2: Evaluating Media & Fan Monetization
```

### Text Content (week2-intro.docx):
```
Media Rights: The Billion-Dollar Core Product

In Week 1, you learned that media rights represent 40-60% of total revenue for major
professional leagues. This week, we examine WHY sports content commands such premium
valuations and HOW rights deals are structured, negotiated, and monetized.

Sports remain the last "appointment viewing" in an era of on-demand entertainment.
Live games can't be spoiled by social media or watched later without losing cultural
currency. This unique characteristic makes sports the most valuable programming for
traditional broadcasters defending against cord-cutting‚Äîand the most expensive content
for streaming platforms trying to acquire subscribers.

You'll analyze the Rogers Communications / NHL deal: $5.2 billion over 12 years for
exclusive Canadian rights. Was it worth it? How do you value something this complex?
What did Rogers get wrong‚Äîand what did they get right? By week's end, you'll understand
media economics well enough to evaluate mega-deals yourself and recommend platform
strategies for sports properties.
```

### Tiles Content:

### Element 1: Text - Why Media Rights Matter (120 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# Media Rights: The Billion-Dollar Foundation

Media rights‚Äîfees paid by broadcasters and streaming platforms to air games‚Äîrepresent the **largest revenue stream** for most professional leagues, typically accounting for **40-60% of total revenue**.

These deals are massive: The NFL's current media rights contracts total **$110 billion over 11 years** ($10B/year). The English Premier League generates over **$5 billion per year** from domestic and international broadcast rights.

**Why sports command premium value:**
- Live games create **"appointment viewing"** (can't watch later without spoilers)
- Sports deliver **simultaneous audiences** (rare in 2024 on-demand world)
- Premium advertising rates: Sports CPM **$50-70** vs. scripted TV **$15-25**

This module explores HOW broadcasters value these rights deals.
```

**Video Specifications:**
- **File:** `week2-video1-valuation-framework.mp4`
- **Duration:** 2 minutes
- **VTT Transcript:** `week2-video1-valuation-framework.vtt` (required)
- **Video Title:** "How to Value Sports Media Rights: The 5-Factor Framework"
- **Script:** See `modules/week2/video-scripts/week2-instructional-videos-2min.md` (Video 1)

- [0:30-0:45] Factor 2: Exclusivity (2-3x cost premium)
- [0:45-1:00] Factor 3: Content Volume (NHL 1,271 games vs. NFL 272)
- [1:00-1:15] Factor 4: Brand Alignment (premium brands pay premium rates)
- [1:15-1:30] Factor 5: Platform Strategy (strategic value exceeds ROI)
- [1:30-2:00] Conclusion (explore via interactive widgets)

---

### Element 3: Vertical List - 5 Valuation Factors at a Glance

Create 5 numbered items:

**Item 1 - Title:** "Audience Size & Demographics"
**Item 1 - Description:** "Larger audiences command higher fees. Coveted demographics (18-49, high income) add premium. Measurement: viewership ratings, subscriber lift, social media reach."

**Item 2 - Title:** "Exclusivity & Competition"
**Item 2 - Description:** "Exclusive rights create bidding wars. Multiple bidders (traditional networks + streamers + tech giants) drive prices up exponentially. Example: NFL Thursday Night Football - Amazon outbid ESPN/NBC."

**Item 3 - Title:** "Content Volume & Flexibility"
**Item 3 - Description:** "More games = more advertising inventory. Live scheduling creates programming certainty (fill 3-hour blocks reliably). NHL 82-game season vs. NFL 17 games affects per-game value."

**Item 4 - Title:** "Brand Alignment & Sponsorship"
**Item 4 - Description:** "Sports properties that align with broadcaster brand attract premium sponsors. Sponsorship revenue offsets rights costs. ESPN+UFC attracts combat sports advertisers (beer, trucks, insurance)."

**Item 5 - Title:** "Platform Strategy Fit"
**Item 5 - Description:** "Does this property help achieve platform goals? Traditional TV: Defend cable subscribers from cord-cutting. Streaming: Acquire new users and reduce churn. Strategic value justifies prices that seem 'too high' on pure ROI."

### Element 4: Widget 1 - Audience Size Calculator

**üéÆ Widget Purpose:** Demonstrate how audience size and demographics drive rights valuations using real league examples.

**Widget Status:** ‚≠ï Phase 3 widget - NEEDS TO BE BUILT (4-5 hours estimated)

**How It Works:**
1. Select league: NFL, NHL, NBA, MLS, Premier League, or Custom
2. Input fields auto-populate with real data (or allow custom):
   - Average viewership per game (millions)
   - Number of games per season
   - Coveted demo % (18-49 with $75K+ income)
   - CPM (cost per thousand viewers) advertising rate
3. Real-time calculations display:
   - Total audience reach (viewers √ó games)
   - Premium audience value (demo multiplier)
   - Advertising revenue potential
   - Estimated annual rights value ($M)
   - Per-game rights value
   - Comparison bar chart vs. NFL baseline

**Real Examples:**
- **NFL:** 17M avg viewers, 272 games ‚Üí **$10B/year**
- **NHL:** 1.5M avg viewers, 1,271 games ‚Üí **$2B/year**
- **MLS:** 300K avg viewers, 408 games ‚Üí **$250M/year**

**Learning Objectives:**
- MLO 2.1: Understand audience size as primary valuation driver
- Recognize "total eyeballs" matters more than per-game ratings
- Calculate simple rights valuations using audience metrics

**Technical Specifications:**
```javascript
function calculateRightsValue(avgViewers, numGames, covetedDemoPercent, cpm) {
  const totalReach = avgViewers * numGames;
  const premiumMultiplier = 1 + (covetedDemoPercent / 100);
  const adRevenuePotential = (totalReach * cpm) / 1000;
  const estimatedRightsValue = adRevenuePotential * premiumMultiplier * 0.4;
  return { totalReach, premiumMultiplier, adRevenuePotential, estimatedRightsValue };
}
```

**Accessibility:**
- ‚úÖ Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter)
- ‚úÖ ARIA labels on all inputs

### Element 5: Text - Exclusivity & Competition Dynamics (150 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# Exclusivity Creates Bidding Wars

**Exclusive rights** cost 2-3x more than non-exclusive packages‚Äîbut they're worth it for strategic reasons.

## Why Exclusivity Matters

**For Broadcasters:**
- Exclusive content can't be found elsewhere (drives subscriptions and viewership)
- Differentiation in crowded streaming market (e.g., Apple TV+ with MLS, Amazon with NFL Thursday)
- Bundling power: "Watch YOUR team only on our platform"

**For Leagues:**
- Multiple bidders drive prices up exponentially
- Competition between traditional networks, streamers (Netflix, Apple, Amazon), and tech giants (Google, Meta)
- Example: NFL split packages across CBS, FOX, NBC, ESPN, Amazon‚Äîmaximized total value

## The Bidding War Dynamic

When Amazon entered NFL rights bidding (2021), traditional networks had to raise bids to compete. Result: NFL rights increased 75% from previous deal despite stable ratings.

**Next: Experience exclusivity bidding through simulation.**
```

### Element 6: Widget 2 - Exclusivity Bidding Simulator

**üéÆ Widget Purpose:** Let students experience competitive bidding dynamics and understand why exclusive rights command premium prices.

**Widget Status:** ‚≠ï Phase 2 widget - NEEDS TO BE BUILT (5-6 hours estimated)

**How It Works:**
1. **Scenario:** You are NHL commissioner in 2025. Three bidders want Canadian national rights:
   - **Rogers (incumbent):** $450M/year (cautious, lost money on 2014 deal)
   - **DAZN (streaming disruptor):** $550M/year (aggressive growth strategy)
   - **Apple TV+ (tech giant):** $700M/year (strategic not financial decision)

2. **Student Decision:** Accept Apple's $700M exclusive OR Split rights package:
   - Rogers $450M regional + DAZN $400M national + Apple $300M streaming = $1.15B total (non-exclusive)

3. **Outcomes Display:**
   - **Exclusive Apple ($700M/year):** Pros: Predictable revenue, single partner. Cons: Canadian fans need subscription, lower total revenue
   - **Split Package ($1.15B/year):** Pros: 64% higher revenue, better accessibility. Cons: Complex coordination, potential conflicts

**Learning Objectives:**
- MLO 2.1: Understand exclusivity premium
- Experience competitive bidding dynamics
- Recognize trade-offs: Highest bidder vs. accessibility vs. total revenue

**Technical Specifications:**
```javascript
const bidders = [
  { name: "Rogers", bid: 450, rationale: "Risk-averse. Prefers regional only." },
  { name: "DAZN", bid: 550, rationale: "Aggressive growth. Needs anchor content." },
  { name: "Apple TV+", bid: 700, rationale: "Strategic acquisition. Global ambitions." }
];

function calculatePackageValue(exclusiveOption, splitOptions) {
  return exclusiveOption ?
    { annual: exclusiveOption.bid, type: "Exclusive" } :
    { annual: splitOptions.reduce((sum, o) => sum + o.bid, 0), type: "Split" };
}
```

**Accessibility:**
- ‚úÖ Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter to reveal/select)
- ‚úÖ ARIA live regions for bid reveals
- ‚úÖ Screen reader compatible bid cards
- ‚úÖ High contrast mode
- ‚úÖ Focus indicators on interactive cards

**Implementation Notes:** Card-based interface with reveal animation, comparison logic, strategic insights panel. Preset scenarios for NHL, NFL, Premier League.

---

### Element 7: Infobox (Note) - Key Insight: Appointment Viewing

```
Title: ‚ñ∂ Key Insight: "Appointment Viewing" in an On-Demand World

Sports are the last true appointment viewing. You can't watch a game "later" without risking spoilers from social media, friends, or news alerts. This creates:

‚Ä¢ Predictable, simultaneous audience (rare in 2024)
‚Ä¢ Premium advertising rates (live = engaged = valuable)
‚Ä¢ Subscription retention power (can't cancel during season)
‚Ä¢ Cultural currency ("Did you see that play?")

This unique characteristic explains why sports rights command prices that seem economically irrational‚Äîuntil you understand their strategic defensive value for traditional broadcasters and offensive value for streaming disruptors.
```

**Design Note:** Yellow Infobox (Note variant). Reinforces WHY bidders compete aggressively.

---

### Element 8: Text - Linear TV vs. Streaming Intro (120 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# Two Business Models, Different Economics

Traditional linear broadcasting and direct-to-consumer streaming have **fundamentally different economics**‚Äîwhich explains why sports rights deals are structured differently for each platform.

## Linear TV (Traditional Broadcasting)
- **Revenue:** Advertising (80%) + carriage fees from cable/satellite providers (20%)
- **Goal:** Maximize viewership to sell ads at premium rates
- **Timeline:** Immediate profitability expected (if deal priced correctly)
- **Risk:** Cord-cutting and audience fragmentation

## Streaming/DTC (Direct-to-Consumer)
- **Revenue:** Subscriptions (90%) + advertising tier (10%)
- **Goal:** Acquire and retain subscribers (customer lifetime value thinking)
- **Timeline:** 3-5 year payback period (invest in growth first)
- **Risk:** Subscriber churn and price sensitivity

**Next: Compare models side-by-side and explore trade-offs.**
```

---

### Element 9: Table - Platform Economics Comparison

| **Model** | **Revenue Sources** | **Cost Structure** | **Key Risks** | **Profitability Timeline** | **Sports Strategy** |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **Linear TV** | Ad revenue (80%)<br>Carriage fees (20%) | Rights fees<br>Production costs | Cord-cutting<br>Audience fragmentation | Immediate (if priced right) | Defend subscribers<br>Must-have to prevent cancellation |
| **Streaming/DTC** | Subscriptions (90%)<br>Advertising tier (10%) | Rights fees<br>Technology infrastructure<br>Customer acquisition costs | Subscriber churn<br>Price sensitivity<br>Content overload | 3-5 years (customer LTV model) | Acquire new users<br>Reduce churn with exclusive sports |

**Table Note:** "Economics vary significantly by property and market. These represent typical patterns for major sports rights deals in 2024."

---

### Element 10: Widget 3 - Platform Economics Visualizer

**üéÆ Widget Purpose:** Let students manipulate platform economics variables and see how profitability timelines differ between linear TV and streaming models.

**Widget Status:** ‚≠ï Phase 2 widget - NEEDS TO BE BUILT (6-7 hours estimated)

**How It Works:**
1. Toggle between **Linear TV** and **Streaming/DTC**
2. Adjust variables with sliders:
   - **Linear TV:** Rights cost, ad CPM, carriage fee, starting subscribers, annual decline %
   - **Streaming:** Rights cost, subscription price, starting subs, monthly growth %, churn rate, CAC
3. View 10-year projection:
   - Line chart: Annual revenue vs. costs
   - Break-even year (or "Never")
   - Cumulative profit/loss
   - Strategic insights (dynamic based on inputs)

**Real-World Presets:**
- **Rogers NHL (Linear):** $433M rights, 11.2M ‚Üí 8.1M subs, NEVER profitable (loss ~$1.5B over 10 years)
- **DAZN Canada (Streaming):** $50M rights, 50K ‚Üí 500K subs, profitable Year 4 (+$200M by Year 10)
- **Apple TV+ MLS (Streaming):** $250M rights, 0 ‚Üí 2M subs, profitable Year 5 IF targets met

**Learning Objectives:**
- MLO 2.2: Compare linear vs. streaming profitability through manipulation
- Understand why streaming "loses money for years"
- Recognize cord-cutting impact on linear TV
- Appreciate why tech giants can "overpay" (LTV thinking)

**Technical Specifications:**
```javascript
function calculateLinearTV(rightsCost, adCPM, carriageFee, startingSubs, annualDecline, years = 10) {
  let results = [];
  let subscribers = startingSubs;
  for (let year = 1; year <= years; year++) {
    subscribers *= (1 - annualDecline);
    const avgViewership = subscribers * 0.15;
    const adRevenue = avgViewership * 50 * adCPM / 1000;
    const carriageRevenue = subscribers * carriageFee * 12;
    const totalRevenue = adRevenue + carriageRevenue;
    const costs = rightsCost + (avgViewership * 2);
    results.push({ year, revenue: totalRevenue, costs, profit: totalRevenue - costs });
  }
  return results;
}

function calculateStreaming(rightsCost, subPrice, startingSubs, monthlyGrowth, churnRate, CAC, years = 10) {
  let results = [];
  let subscribers = startingSubs;
  for (let year = 1; year <= years; year++) {
    for (let month = 1; month <= 12; month++) {
      subscribers = subscribers + (subscribers * monthlyGrowth) - (subscribers * churnRate);
    }
    const revenue = subscribers * subPrice * 12;
    const costs = rightsCost + (startingSubs * CAC);
    results.push({ year, revenue, costs, profit: revenue - costs });
  }
  return results;
}
```

**Accessibility:**
- ‚úÖ Keyboard navigation (Tab, Arrow keys for sliders)
- ‚úÖ ARIA labels on all sliders
- ‚úÖ Screen reader announcements for metrics
- ‚úÖ High contrast chart lines (blue/red/green with patterns)
- ‚úÖ Focus indicators on toggle and presets

**Implementation Notes:** Dual-model toggle, Chart.js line chart with dual axes, preset scenario buttons, metrics panel with strategic insights, PDF export functionality.

### Element 11: Text - Fan Engagement Monetization (150 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# Beyond Passive Viewing: Engagement as Revenue Driver

Modern sports monetization extends beyond passive viewing. **Active fan engagement** creates multiple revenue streams and increases customer lifetime value.

## The Engagement Value Chain

**Passive Viewer** (Low Value):
- Watches games occasionally
- Generates: Advertising impressions, basic viewership metrics
- Value: $5-15/year

**Engaged Fan** (Medium Value):
- Watches regularly + uses team app + follows on social media
- Generates: Premium ad rates, app sponsorship opportunities, first-party data
- Value: $50-100/year

**Super-Fan** (High Value):
- Watches everything + fantasy sports + betting + exclusive content subscriptions
- Generates: Premium subscriptions, betting partnerships, exclusive content monetization
- Value: $300-500+/year

## Why Engagement Matters for Rights Deals

Platforms that drive engagement (interactive features, fantasy integration, betting) justify higher rights costs because they extract more value per viewer.

**Next: Build your own engagement value chain.**
```

---

### Element 12: Widget 4 - Engagement Value Chain Builder

**üéÆ Widget Purpose:** Let students construct an engagement strategy and see how different tactics increase fan value and justify higher rights costs.

**Widget Status:** ‚≠ï Phase 3 widget - NEEDS TO BE BUILT (5-6 hours estimated)

**How It Works:**
1. Choose sport type (NHL, NBA, MLS, NFL, EPL)
2. Set baseline: 1M fans, $10/year passive value
3. Select engagement tactics (checkboxes with costs/benefits):
   - **Mobile App:** +$2M cost ‚Üí 30% adopt ‚Üí +$5/fan value
   - **Fantasy Integration:** +$500K cost ‚Üí 15% participate ‚Üí +$15/fan value
   - **Betting Partnerships:** $0 cost (revenue share) ‚Üí 10% engage ‚Üí +$30/fan value
   - **Exclusive Content:** +$3M cost ‚Üí 20% subscribe ‚Üí +$25/fan value
   - **Social Media Strategy:** +$1M cost ‚Üí 50% follow ‚Üí +$8/fan value
   - **Gamification:** +$1.5M cost ‚Üí 25% participate ‚Üí +$12/fan value
4. View results:
   - Engagement funnel visualization (passive ‚Üí engaged ‚Üí super-fan)
   - Total fan value: $XX.XM/year
   - ROI: (Total value - costs) / costs
   - Rights affordability: "With engagement, you can afford $XXM/year in rights"

**Real Examples:**
- **NBA + DraftKings:** Fan value $12 ‚Üí $45/year (fantasy + betting)
- **Premier League + Social:** International fan value $5 ‚Üí $18/year

**Learning Objectives:**
- MLO 2.3: Understand how engagement extends monetization beyond passive viewing
- Evaluate trade-offs: High-cost/high-value vs. low-cost/broad-reach
- Understand why platforms with engagement capabilities pay more for rights

**Technical Specifications:**

```

### iFrame Specifications:

**Widget Purpose:** Simulate streaming platform strategy decisions to understand trade-offs between content costs, pricing, and subscriber growth.

**Widget Status:** ‚úÖ Phase 2 widget - BUILT AND READY

**How It Works:**
- **Inputs:**
  - Rights acquisition budget ($0-$100M/year across hockey, basketball, soccer, emerging sports)
  - Subscription pricing ($9.99 - $29.99/month)
  - Quarterly decisions: Renew rights? Adjust pricing? Invest in engagement features?
- **Outputs:**
  - Subscriber count (0-1M potential)
  - Monthly churn rate (5%-20%)
  - Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
  - Total content costs
  - Profitability timeline (years to break even)
- **Real Examples:** Rogers Sportsnet NOW ($27.99/month), DAZN Canada ($24.99/month), TSN Direct ($19.99/month)
- **Scenarios:** Competitor launches (pricing pressure), Recession hits (churn increases), Star player trade (subscriber spike)
- **Learning:** Balance content investment vs. subscriber growth, understand 3-5 year payback timelines, experience streaming economics

**Learning Objectives:**
- MLO 2.2: Compare linear broadcasting economics to streaming/DTC profitability timelines
- MLO 2.1: Make rights valuation decisions with budget constraints
- MLO 2.3: Balance engagement tactics with content costs

### Text Content (Reflection Prompt):
```
After completing the Streaming Wars Strategy simulation:

Strategic Reflection Questions:
‚Ä¢ What was your path to profitability? How many years did it take?
‚Ä¢ Which sports properties delivered the best ROI? Which were too expensive?
‚Ä¢ How did you balance content costs vs. subscriber acquisition?
‚Ä¢ What surprised you about the economics of streaming vs. expectations?

This simulation prepares you to analyze the Rogers/NHL deal in Module 5. Rogers
essentially made these same strategic decisions‚Äîbut with $5.2 billion at stake.
Consider: Would you have made the Rogers deal using the insights from this simulation?
```

### AI Chat Widget Configuration:
- **Widget Name:** "Platform Strategy Assistant"
- **System Prompt:** "You are a helpful strategy advisor for MBA students learning about streaming platform economics. Provide guidance for the Streaming Wars Strategy simulation. Don't give direct answers, but ask Socratic questions to help students think through their platform strategy decisions. Focus on: content portfolio diversification, subscriber lifetime value, churn management, pricing psychology, and rights cost vs. subscriber growth trade-offs."
- **Welcome Message:** "Working through your platform strategy? I can help you think through your rights acquisition and pricing decisions. What aspect of your strategy are you considering?"
- **Show System Prompt:** No

### Details Content:
```
Title: ‚óÜ Strategic Considerations (Open if you're stuck)

Not sure how to approach this simulation? Here are some frameworks:

**Customer Lifetime Value (LTV):**
How long will subscribers stay? If average subscriber stays 18 months at $19.99/month,
their LTV is ~$360. How much can you spend to acquire them? How much on content to
retain them?

**Content Portfolio Strategy:**
‚Ä¢ Anchor Properties: High-cost, broad appeal (e.g., NHL, NBA) - drive subscriptions
‚Ä¢ Niche Properties: Lower-cost, targeted appeal (e.g., esports, rugby) - reduce churn
‚Ä¢ Emerging Properties: Speculative bets (e.g., women's sports, new leagues) - differentiation

**The Streaming Profitability Paradox:**
Growth requires spending on content AND customer acquisition. Profitability requires
reducing both. Most streaming services lose money for 3-5 years building scale.

**Pricing Strategy:**
‚Ä¢ Too low: Can't cover content costs, perceived as low-quality
‚Ä¢ Too high: Small addressable market, high churn risk
‚Ä¢ Sweet spot: Premium enough to signal quality, accessible enough for mass market

**Rights Negotiation:**
‚Ä¢ Exclusive rights cost 2-3x more than non-exclusive
‚Ä¢ Multi-year deals lock in costs but reduce flexibility
‚Ä¢ Regional rights (Canada-only) cheaper than global but smaller audience

**Engagement Investments:**
Beyond just streaming games, consider: interactive features, fantasy integration,
social viewing, original content (documentaries, shoulder programming).
These reduce churn but add costs.

**Key Question:**
What is your differentiation? Why do subscribers choose YOU over competitors?
```

**Design Rationale:**
- **iFrame widget** provides experiential learning of complex economics (UDL engagement, Application level)
- **Infobox** clearly frames task and connects to MLOs (QM clarity)
- **Reflection prompt** encourages metacognition and case study preparation (transfer)
- **AI Chat** offers adaptive support for struggling students (UDL scaffolding)
- **Details** provides strategic frameworks without prescribing answers (progressive disclosure)
- Multiple paths to profitability - no single "right" strategy (UDL choice)
- Directly prepares students to evaluate Rogers deal critically (MLO 2.4)

Title: Case Study: Rogers Communications - The $5.2 Billion NHL Bet ‚ñ∏

Context:
In 2013, Rogers Communications shocked the sports media world by paying $5.2 billion
for exclusive Canadian NHL rights‚Äî12 years, all platforms, all games. It was the
largest sports media deal in Canadian history and a massive strategic bet on hockey's
enduring value.

Key Questions for Analysis:
1. How did Rogers value the NHL rights at $5.2 billion? What assumptions did they make?
2. What were the strategic goals beyond pure ROI (e.g., brand positioning, competitive defense)?
3. How did the deal perform vs. expectations? What went right and wrong?
4. Would you have made this deal? What would you have done differently?

This case addresses all Week 2 MLOs:
‚Ä¢ MLO 2.1: Rights valuation methodology
‚Ä¢ MLO 2.2: Platform strategy (linear Sportsnet + streaming)
‚Ä¢ MLO 2.3: Fan engagement and monetization tactics
‚Ä¢ MLO 2.4: Evaluation of mega-deal success/failure

Preparation: Read the full case and all exhibits. Watch the retrospective video.
Be ready for executive discussion.

### Details - Rubric Examples Content:
```
Title: Rubric Details & Example Excerpts

[Expand to see evaluation criteria and examples]

## Deal Evaluation (12 points)

**Excellent (11-12 pts):**
"Applies multiple Week 2 frameworks systematically. Evaluates deal using rights valuation
drivers (audience, exclusivity, volume, brand, strategy fit), platform economics (linear
vs. streaming profitability timelines), and fan engagement monetization. Demonstrates
nuanced understanding of Rogers' strategic rationale vs. financial outcomes."

**Example Excerpt:**
"Rogers' $5.2B valuation assumed three critical drivers: (1) Hockey's enduring Canadian
audience would resist cord-cutting trends [Valuation Driver: Audience], (2) Exclusive
rights would create insurmountable competitive moat [Driver: Exclusivity], and (3)
Sportsnet NOW streaming would achieve 1M+ subscribers by Year 5 at $25/month [Platform
Economics: Subscription revenue]. All three assumptions proved overly optimistic. Actual
streaming subscribers reached only 450K (Exhibit B), advertising revenue declined 33%
due to faster-than-expected cord-cutting, and TSN's diversification strategy proved more
resilient than Rogers anticipated..."

**Proficient (9-10 pts):**
"Applies Week 2 frameworks with some analysis. Evaluates deal using several relevant
concepts. May miss some nuances or fail to integrate all frameworks systematically."

**Developing (6-8 pts):**
"References Week 2 concepts but application is superficial. Evaluation lacks depth or
specificity. May focus on one framework and ignore others."

**Needs Improvement (0-5 pts):**
"Minimal or no application of Week 2 frameworks. Evaluation is purely opinion-based
without supporting analysis."

---

## Mistake Identification (10 points)

**Excellent (9-10 pts):**
"Identifies 2-3 specific, insightful mistakes supported by exhibit data. Goes beyond
obvious errors to reveal strategic misjudgments. Analysis is evidence-based."

**Example Excerpt:**
"Rogers made three critical mistakes: (1) **Overestimated the 'Canadian exceptionalism'
of hockey** - assumed cord-cutting would spare sports fans, but Exhibit A shows ad revenue
declined faster than U.S. trends; (2) **Failed to build differentiated engagement beyond
live games** - Sportsnet NOW was pure streaming with minimal fantasy, social, or interactive
features (contrast with DAZN's multi-sport strategy), leading to high churn; (3) **No
flexibility clause for black swan events** - COVID devastated Year 7 revenue (Exhibit A:
$200M vs. projected $550M) with no force majeure protection in the contract."

**Proficient (7-8 pts):**
"Identifies 2-3 reasonable mistakes with some supporting evidence. Analysis is solid
but may lack depth or miss less obvious strategic errors."

Title: ‚óâ Week 2 Key Takeaways

You've completed your deep dive into media rights and fan monetization! Here's what
you should take away:

‚úì Sports remain "appointment viewing" in an on-demand world‚Äîthis drives premium valuations
‚úì Streaming economics differ fundamentally from linear TV (LTV vs. immediate ROI)
‚úì Fan engagement monetization extends beyond passive viewing (data, sponsorship, retention)
‚úì Mega-deals like Rogers/NHL require scenario planning and flexibility‚Äîdisruption happens

This foundation prepares you for Week 3, where we'll explore the fastest-growing revenue
streams: sponsorship activation and sports betting integration.

Plus: This week you'll form your Anchor Project team and select your sport property!

Well done! üëè

‚Ä¢ Introduce yourselves (background, interests, strengths)
‚Ä¢ Define roles (Project Manager, Research Lead, Financial Analyst, Creative Lead, etc.)
‚Ä¢ Establish communication norms (meeting frequency, response times, tools)
‚Ä¢ Create conflict resolution process

### Step 2: Select Your Sport Property
Use the **Property Selection Tool** below to explore 19 curated options:

**Legacy Properties:** Established teams/leagues (e.g., Toronto FC, Vancouver Whitecaps, Rugby Canada)
**Emerging Sports:** High-growth opportunities (e.g., Canadian Premier League, National Lacrosse League)
**Major Events:** One-time or recurring events (e.g., 2026 FIFA World Cup - Toronto/Vancouver)

Your team should choose a property that:
‚Ä¢ Is interesting and marketable
‚Ä¢ Presents clear business challenges (revenue growth, fan engagement, market expansion)
‚Ä¢ Has accessible public information (financial data, attendance, media presence)

### Step 3: Write Your 1-Page Project Proposal
**Due: End of Week 2**

Include:
‚Ä¢ Team roster with roles
‚Ä¢ Chosen sport property
‚Ä¢ 250-word rationale: Why is this property interesting? What marketing challenges does it face?

### Details Content - Anchor Project FAQs:
```
Title: ‚óÜ Anchor Project FAQs

[Expand for answers to common questions]

**Q: How many team members should we have?**
A: 5-6 students is ideal. Fewer than 5 makes workload challenging; more than 6 creates
coordination overhead.

**Q: Can we choose a property not on the list?**
A: Yes, with instructor approval. Your property must: (1) Have sufficient public data
available, (2) Present clear marketing challenges, (3) Be a professional or semi-pro
organization (not amateur/recreational). Submit your proposal for approval.

**Q: What if our chosen property is also chosen by another team?**
A: That's fine! Different teams will develop different strategies for the same property.
This mirrors real consulting competitions.

**Q: How much time should we invest in the Anchor Project each week?**
A: Week 2: 2-3 hours (team formation, property selection)
   Week 3: 2-3 hours (revenue model development)
   Week 4: 3-4 hours (brand strategy, competitive analysis)
   Week 5: 4-6 hours (final presentation preparation)

**Q: What if a team member isn't contributing?**
A: Your Team Charter should include accountability mechanisms. If issues persist, use
your conflict resolution process. As a last resort, contact the instructor. Peer
evaluations in Week 5 will account for individual contributions.

**Q: Can we interview executives at our chosen property?**
A: Absolutely! Original research strengthens your project. If you conduct interviews,
include key insights and quotes in your final presentation.

**Q: What resources are available beyond the tools?**
A: Each week provides readings, frameworks, and templates. Use office hours for team
check-ins. The AI chat assistants can help with specific questions. Discussion forums
are great for crowdsourcing ideas from other teams.
