## PART 1: Media Rights Strategy (0:00-30:00)

**[ON-SCREEN: Ivey Business School & TSN/DAZN logos]**

**[CAMERA: Wide shot of executive]**

**INSTRUCTOR (VOICE-OVER):**
Welcome back. Last week, you explored sports revenue ecosystems and learned that media rights represent 40-60% of total revenue for major leagues. This week, we're diving deep into the strategic decisions behind billion-dollar media deals.

Joining us is [Executive Name], [Title] at [TSN/DAZN Canada], who has negotiated over $[X] billion in sports rights deals and oversees [X] properties including [list key properties]. They'll walk us through how media companies evaluate, negotiate, and monetize sports content—and what goes into deals like the Rogers $5.2 billion NHL acquisition.

[Executive Name], welcome.

**[CAMERA: Medium close-up of executive]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
Thanks. I'm excited to unpack media strategy with you—because this is where sports business gets really interesting and really complex.

Let me start by framing the decision we face every day: **Which sports properties should we acquire rights to, and at what price?**

It sounds simple, but it involves:
- Financial modeling (will this make money?)
- Strategic positioning (does this fit our brand?)
- Competitive dynamics (are we bidding against deep-pocketed tech companies?)
- Long-term platform goals (are we building for linear TV or streaming?)
- Risk management (what if viewership declines or cord-cutting accelerates?)

**[ON-SCREEN: Media Rights Valuation Framework]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
We use a five-factor framework to evaluate sports rights. You learned these last week, but let me show you how we actually apply them in negotiations.

---

### Factor 1: Audience Size & Demographics (5 min)

**EXECUTIVE:**
First question: **How many people will watch, and who are they?**

For every property, we model:
- **Total viewership:** Average audience per game/event
- **Demographic composition:** Age, gender, income, education
- **Viewership trends:** Is this growing or declining?
- **Regional vs. national appeal:** Does this travel beyond home markets?

**Example: NHL Hockey in Canada**

Hockey in Canada delivers:
- Consistent 1.3-1.8M viewers for Saturday night Hockey Night in Canada
- Males 18-49 (premium demographic for advertisers)
- High-income households (hockey fans skew affluent)
- **Problem:** Viewership has declined 15-20% over the past decade (cord-cutting + younger demo shift)

When Rogers bid $5.2B in 2013, they modeled steady/growing viewership. Reality: accelerating decline. That's a $100M+/year revenue miss.

**[ON-SCREEN: Viewership Trend Chart]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
Lesson: **Don't assume linear trends. Model multiple scenarios—best case, base case, worst case. Then stress-test your P&L against the worst case.**

---

### Factor 2: Exclusivity & Competition (6 min)

**EXECUTIVE:**
Second question: **How badly do competitors want this, and can we get exclusivity?**

Exclusivity creates market power, but it costs 2-3x more than non-exclusive rights. You have to ask: Is that premium worth it?

**When exclusivity makes sense:**
- You're trying to defend subscribers from leaving (traditional TV model)
- You're building a brand identity around being "home of [property]"
- Competitors would use this property to steal your customers

**When exclusivity doesn't make sense:**
- You're a streaming challenger trying to build a diversified portfolio (better to have non-exclusive rights to many properties)
- The audience is fragmented and won't churn based on one property
- The exclusivity premium eats all your profit margin

**Case Example: DAZN's Strategy**

DAZN came into Canada in 2017 with a different playbook than Rogers/TSN:
- **Non-exclusive rights** to soccer, boxing, combat sports, NFL
- **Lower per-property costs** (no bidding wars)
- **Diversified portfolio** (if one property underperforms, others compensate)
- **Lower price point** ($20/month vs. $28/month for Sportsnet NOW)

Result: DAZN carved out a niche without overpaying for exclusive NHL rights. Smarter strategy? Depends on your goals. But definitely **less risky**.

**[PAUSE]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
Here's the uncomfortable truth about exclusivity: **It often doesn't work financially.**

Rogers paid a massive exclusivity premium for NHL rights. Did it prevent cord-cutting? No. Did it drive Sportsnet NOW subscriptions? Not enough. The strategic theory was sound, but the market moved faster than their model.

My advice: **Be skeptical of exclusivity premiums unless you have ironclad evidence it changes consumer behavior.**

---

### Factor 3: Content Volume & Scheduling Flexibility (5 min)

**EXECUTIVE:**
Third question: **How many games can we broadcast, and when?**

More games = more advertising inventory = more revenue. But it's not linear.

**NHL Example:**
- 82 games/team × 32 teams = 1,312 games per season
- Sounds like a lot of inventory, right? Not for a broadcaster.

Why? Because **games happen simultaneously**. On a Saturday night, you can only broadcast 1-2 games nationally. The rest have no national TV value (regional only).

Compare to the NFL:
- 17 games/team × 32 teams = 272 games total
- Most games happen in concentrated windows (Sunday 1pm, 4pm, 8pm; Monday, Thursday, Saturday)
- **Every game can be nationally televised** with minimal overlap

That's why NFL games command higher per-game value than NHL games, despite fewer total games.

**[ON-SCREEN: Content Volume vs. Value Chart]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
Lesson: **Quality of inventory matters more than quantity.** One NFL Sunday Night Football slot is worth more than 10 mid-week NHL games.

---

### Factor 4: Brand Alignment & Sponsorship Activation (6 min)

**EXECUTIVE:**
Fourth question: **Can we monetize this beyond advertising through sponsorships?**

This is where media rights become ecosystem plays. Let me show you how we think about sponsorship revenue at [TSN/DAZN]:

**Sponsorship Revenue = Rights Value Multiplier**

When we acquire rights to a property, we're not just buying ad inventory. We're buying:
- **Broadcast integrations:** "This power play brought to you by Scotiabank"
- **Studio show sponsorships:** "Sportsnet Central, presented by Canadian Tire"
- **Digital extensions:** Sponsored content, social media campaigns, app features
- **B2B hospitality:** Suite access and event tickets we can offer to sponsors

For a major property like NHL hockey, we can generate **$100-150M/year in incremental sponsorship revenue** that wouldn't exist without the rights.

That sponsorship revenue can subsidize 20-35% of your rights costs. **This is how many "unprofitable" deals actually pencil.**

**Example: TSN's Formula 1 Deal**

F1 delivers modest TV ratings (200-400K viewers per race in Canada). But:
- Luxury brand alignment (affluent, global audience)
- Premium sponsorship inventory (watch brands, automakers, financial services)
- Hospitality opportunities (Monaco GP, Canadian GP paddock access for VIP clients)

The sponsorship and brand halo effect makes this deal profitable, even though ad revenue alone wouldn't justify it.

**[PAUSE]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
Key insight: **If you can't build a sponsorship ecosystem around a property, think twice about acquiring it.**

---

### Factor 5: Platform Strategy Fit (8 min)

**EXECUTIVE:**
Fifth and final question: **Does this property help us achieve our long-term platform goals?**

This is where financial analysis meets strategic vision. Sometimes you pay more than a property is "worth" because it serves a bigger objective.

**[ON-SCREEN: Linear TV vs. Streaming Platform Goals]**

**Traditional Broadcasters (Bell Media/Rogers):**
- **Goal:** Defend cable/satellite subscribers from cord-cutting
- **Sports role:** Retention tool (sports fans are 40% less likely to cancel cable)
- **Valuation logic:** "This deal loses $50M/year, but it prevents $500M in subscriber churn losses. Net benefit: $450M."

**Streaming Platforms (DAZN, Amazon, Apple):**
- **Goal:** Acquire new subscribers and build daily engagement habits
- **Sports role:** Subscriber acquisition tool (sports drive app downloads and habitual usage)
- **Valuation logic:** "This deal costs $200M/year, but it brings 2M new subscribers at $100 LTV each. Net benefit: +$200M."

**[CASE EXAMPLE: Amazon NFL Thursday Night Football]**

Amazon paid $1 billion/year for exclusive NFL Thursday Night Football streaming rights. Did they do it for ad revenue? No.

They did it because:
- NFL drives Prime membership sign-ups (estimated 3-5M new members)
- Prime members spend 2-3x more on Amazon retail than non-members
- Sports viewers use Prime Video more frequently, increasing platform stickiness

The **retail halo effect** justifies the sports investment. This is ecosystem thinking at scale.

**[ON-SCREEN: Strategic Value > Financial Value (Sometimes)]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
But here's the warning: **"Strategic value" can become an excuse for bad deals.**

Rogers used this logic for the NHL deal: "We're not buying rights, we're buying subscriber defense."

Problem: They overestimated how much sports actually prevent cord-cutting. When subscribers left anyway, the strategic case collapsed—leaving only an unprofitable P&L.

My rule: **Strategic value is real, but it must be measurable and testable.** If you can't prove the causal link between sports rights and strategic outcomes, you're speculating.

### Closing Part 1 (5 min)

**[CAMERA: Close-up of executive]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
Alright, we've covered the five-factor framework. Now let's apply it.

In Module 4, you'll complete the **Streaming Wars Strategy simulation**. You'll be the VP of Content Strategy for a new Canadian streaming platform, deciding:
- Which sports properties to bid on
- How much to pay
- What subscription price to charge
- How to balance content costs vs. subscriber growth

This simulation will make you live the trade-offs we've been discussing.

After you complete it, come back and watch Part 2 of this session—where I'll debrief common strategies, mistakes, and insights.

**[ON-SCREEN: Instructions for Students]**

**INSTRUCTOR (VOICE-OVER):**
Students, pause here. Go to Module 4 and complete the Streaming Wars Strategy simulation. It takes 30-45 minutes. When you're done, return to this video and watch Part 2 for executive feedback on your strategic decisions.

**[FADE TO BLACK]**

## PART 2: Streaming Wars Simulation Debrief (30:00-70:00)

**[ON-SCREEN: "Part 2: Simulation Debrief - Streaming Wars Strategy"]**

**[CAMERA: Wide shot of executive + screen showing simulation interface]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
Welcome back. You've just completed the Streaming Wars Strategy simulation. Let's talk about what you experienced and what it reveals about real-world media strategy.

I've run this simulation with hundreds of executives and MBA students. I see three common strategies emerge:

**[ON-SCREEN: Three Common Strategies]**

**Strategy #1: "Go Big or Go Home" - Anchor Property Focus**

**Characteristics:**
- Spend 60-70% of budget on one premium property (NHL, NBA, or soccer)
- Price subscription at $24.99-29.99/month
- Bet on that anchor property driving mass adoption

**Pros:**
- Clear brand identity ("Home of NHL Hockey")
- Can charge premium pricing if property has dedicated fanbase
- Simplified marketing message

**Cons:**
- High risk if property underperforms or viewership declines
- No diversification if property doesn't resonate with target demo
- Expensive to acquire exclusivity

**Real-World Example:** **Sportsnet NOW**

This was Rogers' strategy with their NHL-focused streaming service. How did it work?

**[ON-SCREEN: Sportsnet NOW Performance Data]**

- **Year 1 (2016):** 50K subscribers - missed 200K target by 75%
- **Year 3 (2018):** 200K subscribers - still 50% below projections
- **Year 5 (2020):** 350K subscribers - profitable? Barely, after 5 years
- **Year 8 (2024):** 450K subscribers - still below break-even threshold

**What went wrong?**
1. **Overestimated NHL-only appeal:** Most hockey fans already had cable. Why pay extra for streaming?
2. **No content diversification:** If you're not a hockey fan, Sportsnet NOW has nothing for you
3. **No engagement features:** Just streaming games, no fantasy integration, no social features, no original content

**Lesson:** **Anchor properties are risky unless you layer engagement and diversification on top.**

---

**Strategy #2: "Buffet Approach" - Diversified Portfolio**

**Characteristics:**
- Spread budget across 4-6 properties (mix of mainstream + niche)
- Price subscription at $14.99-19.99/month
- Bet on variety attracting broader audience

**Pros:**
- Lower risk (one underperforming property doesn't sink you)
- Broader addressable market (something for everyone)
- Can acquire non-exclusive rights at lower costs

**Cons:**
- No clear brand identity (what are you known for?)
- Harder to market (can't say "Home of [X]")
- May end up with mediocre engagement across all properties

**Real-World Example:** **DAZN Canada**

DAZN launched in Canada with soccer (Premier League, Champions League, Serie A), NFL Game Pass, boxing, MMA, and niche sports.

**[ON-SCREEN: DAZN Canada Performance]**

- **Year 1 (2017):** 100K subscribers - moderate launch
- **Year 3 (2019):** 300K subscribers - growing steadily
- **Year 5 (2021):** Lost NFL rights, added MLB - subscriber churn spike
- **Year 7 (2024):** ~400-500K subscribers (estimated)

**What worked?**
1. **Lower price point:** $19.99/month vs. $27.99 for Sportsnet NOW
2. **Niche targeting:** Served underserved fans (soccer, combat sports)
3. **Flexibility:** Could drop/add properties without existential risk

**What struggled?**
1. **Brand confusion:** "What is DAZN?" - hard to explain value prop
2. **Property turnover:** Losing NFL hurt, forced repositioning
3. **No Canadian content anchor:** Felt like a foreign service in Canadian market

**Lesson:** **Diversification reduces risk but requires clear target audience and strong retention tactics.**

---

**Strategy #3: "Emerging Sports Focus" - Niche Domination**

**Characteristics:**
- Target emerging/underserved sports (women's leagues, esports, rugby, lacrosse)
- Low-cost rights acquisition (minimal bidding competition)
- Price at $9.99-14.99/month (accessible entry point)
- Build community around underserved fans

**Pros:**
- Very low content costs (can be profitable quickly)
- Fanatical audience loyalty (serving unmet demand)
- Less competition from incumbents

**Cons:**
- Small addressable market (ceiling on growth)
- Properties may lack production quality (lower engagement)
- Risk of being acquired/displaced if property grows (bigger players move in)

**Real-World Example:** **FloSports**

FloSports built a streaming empire around niche sports (wrestling, track & field, gymnastics, rodeo). They:
- Acquired low-cost rights to underserved sports
- Charged $30/month (high price, but captive audience)
- Built community features (forums, athlete content)

**[ON-SCREEN: FloSports Model]**

Result: **Profitable within 2-3 years** (uncommon for streaming), now valued at $1B+.

**Lesson:** **Serving underserved niches can be more profitable than competing head-on with major properties.**

---

### Common Mistakes in the Simulation (10 min)

**EXECUTIVE:**
Now let's talk about the mistakes I see most often—both in the simulation and in real board rooms:

**[ON-SCREEN: Top 5 Mistakes]**

**Mistake #1: Pricing Too Low**

Many students price their service at $9.99-12.99/month, thinking it'll maximize subscribers.

Problem: **At that price, you can't cover content costs.**

If you're paying $200M/year for NHL rights and charging $9.99/month, you need **1.7M subscribers just to break even** on content—not counting technology, marketing, customer support, or churn.

Reality: Most Canadian streaming services plateau at 300-500K subscribers. You're losing $100M+/year.

**Lesson:** **Price for your content costs, not for maximum subscribers.** Would you rather have 300K subscribers at $25/month ($90M/year) or 500K at $10/month ($60M/year)? The former covers more of your $200M content bill.

**Mistake #2: Ignoring Churn**

Students model subscriber growth but forget subscribers leave.

Typical streaming churn rates:
- Sports-only services often experience high seasonal churn, frequently in the **25–40% annual range**
- Diversified entertainment services: **15-25% annual churn**

That means: If you acquire 50K subscribers/month, but 35K churn/month, your net growth is only 15K. It takes **5+ years to hit 1M subscribers**.

**Lesson:** **Retention is as important as acquisition.** Invest in engagement features (fantasy, social, original content) to reduce churn.

**Mistake #3: Underestimating Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC)**

It's not enough to build a service. You have to get people to sign up.

Typical CAC for streaming services:
- Digital ads: $50-150 per subscriber
- TV advertising: $100-200 per subscriber
- Partnerships/bundles: $20-50 per subscriber

If you're acquiring 50K subscribers/month at $100 CAC, that's **$5M/month in marketing spend** = $60M/year.

Add that to content costs ($200M), technology ($20M), and operations ($10M), and you're spending $290M/year before you generate $1 in revenue.

**Lesson:** **Model P&L including CAC. Most streaming services lose money for 3-5 years.** Investors need to believe in long-term subscriber LTV to fund those losses.

**Mistake #4: Buying Too Many Properties Too Fast**

Some students bid on 6-7 properties in Year 1, thinking variety = subscribers.

Problem: **You run out of budget and can't afford to renew rights in Year 3-4.**

Content costs escalate 10-20% with each contract renewal. If you're already maxed out, you have to drop properties—causing subscriber churn.

**Lesson:** **Start narrow, prove profitability, then expand.** Better to dominate 2-3 properties than spread yourself thin across 7.

**Mistake #5: Ignoring Platform Differentiation**

Lots of students think: "If I have NHL rights, subscribers will come."

But why would fans subscribe to YOUR service instead of:
- Keeping cable (still has NHL + everything else)
- Using a VPN + international streaming (cheaper)
- Going to bars or friends' houses (free)

You need **differentiation beyond just having rights:**
- **Better UX:** Multi-view, stats overlays, instant replays
- **Engagement features:** Fantasy integration, social watch parties, prediction games
- **Exclusive content:** Behind-the-scenes, player interviews, documentaries
- **Personalization:** AI-driven highlights, custom notifications

**Lesson:** **Rights are table stakes. Experience and engagement create sustainable competitive advantage.**

### What High Performers Did (8 min)

**EXECUTIVE:**
Now let's look at what the top 10% of simulation participants did differently:

**[ON-SCREEN: High Performer Traits]**

**Trait #1: They Modeled Multiple Scenarios**

They didn't just assume "best case." They ran:
- **Best case:** Viewership grows, churn stays low, CAC improves
- **Base case:** Viewership flat, churn 30%, CAC stable
- **Worst case:** Viewership declines, churn 40%, CAC increases

Then they picked strategies that stayed profitable in **base case** and survivable in **worst case**.

**Trait #2: They Focused on Unit Economics**

They obsessed over:
- **Customer LTV** (Lifetime Value): How long does average subscriber stay × monthly price
- **CAC Payback Period**: How many months to recover acquisition cost
- **Contribution Margin**: Revenue per subscriber minus variable costs

If LTV > CAC, the business can scale profitably. If not, every new subscriber loses money.

**Trait #3: They Used Partnerships Strategically**

Instead of trying to be standalone, they:
- Bundled with telecom providers (Rogers, Bell, Telus) to reduce CAC
- Co-marketed with sponsors (beer brands promoting service at retail)
- Syndicated content to reach casual fans (YouTube highlights driving subscriptions)

This reduced customer acquisition costs by 50-70% vs. pure digital advertising.

**Trait #4: They Invested in Retention**

They allocated 10-15% of budget to engagement features:
- Fantasy sports integration
- Social viewing features (watch parties, live chat)
- Gamification (prediction games, leaderboards)
- Original content (documentaries, shoulder programming)

Result: Churn dropped from 35% to 22%, increasing LTV by 60%.

**Trait #5: They Thought Long-Term**

They didn't panic when Year 1-2 showed losses. They understood:
- Streaming profitability takes 3-5 years
- Early investments in tech and content pay off later
- Subscriber growth compounds if you nail retention

By Year 5, they were profitable and growing—while short-term thinkers had shut down or sold.

### Connecting to Rogers NHL Case (5 min)

**EXECUTIVE:**
Everything we've discussed applies directly to the Rogers case you'll analyze next.

**[ON-SCREEN: Rogers NHL Deal Key Metrics]**

Rogers made several strategic bets:
1. **Anchor property strategy:** Go all-in on NHL
2. **High pricing:** $27.99/month for Sportsnet NOW
3. **Subscriber defense:** Betting sports would prevent cord-cutting
4. **Long-term lock-in:** 12-year exclusive deal

Which of these worked? Which failed? Why?

As you read the case, ask:
- What scenarios did Rogers model? Did they stress-test worst case?
- What was their CAC strategy? Did they invest enough in subscriber acquisition?
- How did they handle churn? What engagement features did they build?
- What would YOU have done differently?

We'll discuss this in Part 3.

**[PAUSE]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
Alright, take a break. When you're ready, watch Part 3 where we'll analyze the Rogers case together.

## PART 3: Rogers NHL Case Discussion (70:00-90:00)

**[ON-SCREEN: "Part 3: Rogers NHL Deal Case Discussion"]**

**[CAMERA: Medium shot of executive with case exhibits on screen]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
Welcome to Part 3. You've read the Rogers NHL case, completed the simulation, and heard my strategic framework. Let's put it all together.

**[ON-SCREEN: Rogers NHL Deal Summary]**

**The Deal:**
- $5.2 billion over 12 years (2014-2026)
- Exclusive Canadian rights: national TV, regional TV, digital, streaming
- All platforms: Sportsnet (linear), Sportsnet NOW (streaming), Radio

**The Promise:**
- Defend cable subscribers
- Build Sportsnet brand
- Grow streaming business
- Achieve profitability by Year 7

**The Reality:**
- Lost money every single year
- Cord-cutting accelerated
- Streaming growth slower than projected
- COVID-19 devastated Year 7 (2020-21)

**[ON-SCREEN: Rogers NHL Financial Performance Chart]**

### What Went Wrong: The Three Fatal Flaws (8 min)

**EXECUTIVE:**
Rogers made three critical mistakes:

**Fatal Flaw #1: They Overestimated "Subscriber Defense"**

**The Assumption:**
NHL rights would prevent 500K-1M subscribers from cutting the cord. At $80/month cable bill, that's $480-960M/year in retained revenue.

**The Reality:**
Sports slowed cord-cutting, but didn't stop it. Subscribers left anyway because:
- Younger demos don't watch traditional TV (regardless of sports)
- Streaming alternatives improved (Netflix, Disney+, Amazon)
- Economic pressures (2016-2020 recession, COVID job losses)

**The Math:**
If you retain only 200K subscribers instead of 500K, that's $288M/year in lost revenue ($24M/month × 12). Over 12 years, that's $3.5B in missed projections—more than half the deal value.

**Lesson:** **External trends (cord-cutting, generational shifts) are stronger than individual content decisions.** You can't model away secular decline.

**Fatal Flaw #2: They Underinvested in Streaming UX and Engagement**

**The Assumption:**
"If we build Sportsnet NOW, hockey fans will subscribe."

**The Reality:**
Sportsnet NOW was a **bare-bones streaming service:**
- Just live games (no replays, highlights, or shoulder content for first 2 years)
- No fantasy integration
- No social features
- No original content (documentaries, behind-the-scenes)
- Clunky UI (app crashes, buffering issues reported)

Compare to NBA League Pass or NFL Game Pass, which offer:
- Multi-game viewing
- Stats overlays and real-time data
- Condensed game replays (watch full game in 45 min)
- Original content and classic games library

**The Result:**
Sportsnet NOW peaked at 450K subscribers—far below the 1M+ Rogers projected.

**Lesson:** **Content is table stakes. Experience and engagement drive retention.** If your streaming service is just "worse cable," people won't pay for it.

**Fatal Flaw #3: No Flexibility Clause for Black Swan Events**

**The Assumption:**
12 years is long enough to weather volatility.

**The Reality:**
COVID-19 hit in Year 7 (2020-21):
- Shortened season (56 games instead of 82)
- No fans in arenas (reduced atmosphere, lower ratings)
- Economic downturn (ad revenue collapsed)
- **Rogers still paid full rights fees**—no force majeure clause

**The Impact:**
Rogers lost an estimated $200-250M in 2020-21 alone. That was supposed to be their first profitable year. Instead, it was their worst year.

**Lesson:** **Long-term deals need flexibility clauses for unexpected events.** Force majeure, revenue share adjustments, or renegotiation triggers.

---

### What Rogers Did Right (Don't Miss These!) (5 min)

**EXECUTIVE:**
It's easy to criticize the Rogers deal. But they did make some smart moves:

**Smart Move #1: Maintained Linear + Streaming Hybrid**

Rogers didn't abandon linear TV for streaming. They kept Sportsnet cable channel strong while building Sportsnet NOW. This hedged their bets.

Many pure-play streaming services failed (DAZN Canada struggled, FloSports went niche). Rogers' linear business kept them afloat while streaming matured.

**Smart Move #2: Built a Content Library and Brand Asset**

Even though the deal lost money, Rogers now owns:
- 10+ years of NHL broadcast history (replay value, highlight packages)
- "Sportsnet" brand association with hockey (brand equity)
- Production infrastructure and expertise (can reuse for other sports)

These assets have value beyond P&L. If Rogers sells Sportsnet, that NHL legacy adds $500M-1B to valuation.

**Smart Move #3: Learned Expensive Lessons for Future Deals**

Rogers won't make the same mistakes again:
- Future deals will have shorter terms (5-7 years, not 12)
- More conservative subscriber projections
- Greater investment in streaming UX from Day 1
- Flexibility clauses for force majeure

That institutional learning is worth $500M+ in avoided future mistakes.

**[PAUSE]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
So was the Rogers deal a failure? **Financially, yes. Strategically, mixed.**

They overpaid, underdelivered on streaming, and got unlucky with COVID. But they also secured NHL rights for a generation, defended (some) subscribers, and learned lessons that will shape Canadian sports media for decades.

### If You Were Rogers CEO in 2013... What Would You Do? (5 min)

**EXECUTIVE:**
Let's close with a thought experiment. You're Rogers' CEO in 2013. You know NHL rights are up for bid. TSN (your competitor) also wants them. What's your strategy?

**Option A: Bid Aggressively (What Rogers Did)**
- Pay $5.2B for exclusivity
- Bet on subscriber defense and streaming growth
- Risk: Overpay if assumptions don't hold

**Option B: Bid Conservatively**
- Pay $3-3.5B for non-exclusive rights (share with TSN)
- Lower risk, lower reward
- Maintain profitability, but lose brand differentiation

**Option C: Walk Away**
- Don't bid, let TSN take NHL
- Invest $5.2B in building streaming tech, acquiring niche sports, and international expansion
- Risk: Lose Canada's #1 sport, cede market leadership

**Option D: Partner with Tech Company**
- Co-bid with Apple, Amazon, or Google
- Split costs and risks
- Leverage tech partner's streaming platform and global reach

**[PAUSE]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
There's no right answer. But here's mine:

**I would have done Option B + Option D:**
- Bid for **non-exclusive national rights** (not all regional rights)
- Partner with a tech company (Apple or Amazon) to **co-invest in streaming platform**
- Keep costs at $2-3B total (shared with partner)
- Invest savings in **engagement features, content library, and international sports**

This would have:
- Maintained NHL brand association (just not exclusive)
- Reduced financial risk (partner shares losses)
- Accelerated streaming UX (leverage tech partner's platform)
- Preserved capital for future deals

Rogers bet the company on NHL exclusivity. That was bold—but too risky.

---

### Final Thoughts & Next Steps (2 min)

**[CAMERA: Close-up of executive]**

**EXECUTIVE:**
Media rights strategy is part art, part science, and part luck.

The best you can do is:
1. **Model conservatively:** Assume worst-case scenarios
2. **Build flexibility:** Short-term deals, force majeure clauses, partner hedges
3. **Invest in experience:** Content is table stakes; engagement drives retention
4. **Think ecosystem:** Rights are means to larger strategic ends (subscribers, brand, data)

The Rogers case is a cautionary tale. But it's also a masterclass in the complexity of sports media strategy.

As you complete your Mini-Case Memo, remember:
- Evaluate the deal using the five-factor framework
- Identify specific mistakes (with evidence from exhibits)
- Provide actionable recommendations for Rogers' 2026 decision

And remember: There's no single "right" answer. Strategic thinking is about **making defensible decisions under uncertainty.**

## Student Discussion Prompts (Post-Video)

After completing the full 3-part session, students should engage with these discussion forum questions:

### Discussion Prompt #1: Your Simulation Strategy
Share your Streaming Wars Strategy approach. Which strategy did you choose (Anchor Property, Buffet, Emerging Sports, or hybrid)? What were your results (years to profitability, final subscriber count)? What would you do differently?

### Discussion Prompt #2: Rogers' Biggest Mistake
The executive identified three "fatal flaws" in Rogers' NHL strategy. Which was the MOST critical? Could Rogers have foreseen and mitigated it? Defend your position with evidence from the case exhibits.

### Discussion Prompt #3: The 2026 Decision
Rogers' NHL deal expires in 2026. Should they:
- **Renew** (at what price?)
- **Renegotiate** (what terms?)
- **Walk away** (invest in what instead?)
- **Partner** (with whom?)

Make your recommendation with clear strategic rationale.
