## VIDEO #5 IO - Cohort - BOSM – W2-M3, V1 (Media Rights Valuation)

**Purpose:** Introduce the 5-factor valuation framework before Streaming Wars simulation
**Placement:** Module 3 (Media Rights Framework) - Before simulation activity
**Visual Style:** Animated framework with quick data examples

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]**

**[ANIMATION: Billion-dollar figures materializing]**

**NARRATOR:**
Amazon paid $1 billion per year for NFL Thursday Night Football. Rogers paid $5.2 billion over 12 years for NHL Canadian rights.

How do media companies decide what sports content is worth?

The Five-Factor Valuation Framework.

---

**[SECTION: FACTORS 1-2 - 0:15-0:45]**

**[ANIMATION: Five factors appearing with icons]**

**NARRATOR:**
Factor 1: Audience Size and Demographics. Larger, more valuable audiences command higher prices. NFL regular season games average 17-19 million viewers with premium demographics—males 18-49, high income. Advertisers pay $50-70 per thousand viewers—double non-sports rates.

Critical: Model viewership trends, not just current numbers. Rogers assumed stable NHL ratings. They experienced ratings declines of 12% or more in recent seasons. That's hundreds of millions in lost revenue.

Factor 2: Exclusivity and Competition. More bidders equals higher prices. Exclusive rights cost 2-3x more than non-exclusive. When Amazon, Apple, and traditional networks compete for NFL rights, prices skyrocket. NFL deal increased significantly from 2011 to 2022, driven by competitive bidding among multiple platforms.

---

**[SECTION: FACTORS 3-5 - 0:45-1:30]**

**NARRATOR:**
Factor 3: Content Volume and Scheduling. Quality matters more than quantity. One NFL primetime game is worth 10-15 mid-week NHL games. Concentrated scheduling windows—NFL Sundays—create predictable audience habits and higher per-game value.

Factor 4: Brand Alignment and Sponsorship. Sponsorship revenue can subsidize 20-35% of rights costs. Strong brand alignment with sponsor categories (automotive, beer, financial services) creates premium sponsorship opportunities. Without sponsorship integration, profitability becomes harder to achieve.

Factor 5: Platform Strategy Fit. Sometimes you pay more than a property is "worth" because it serves strategic goals. Amazon's $1 billion per year for NFL drives subscriber acquisition and loyalty for Prime membership, with reported record Prime sign-ups during NFL broadcasts. However, strategic value must be measurable and achievable.

Warning: Strategic value justifications must be grounded in data. Rogers justified overpaying with "subscriber defense" logic—but couldn't prove the relationship between NHL rights and subscriber retention. When subscribers left anyway, the case collapsed.

**[CLOSING - 1:30-2:00]**

**[ON-SCREEN: Five factors framework]**

**NARRATOR:**
The Five Factors: Audience Size and Demographics. Exclusivity and Competition. Content Volume and Scheduling. Brand Alignment and Sponsorship. Platform Strategy Fit.

In the Streaming Wars simulation, you'll apply this framework to make your own billion-dollar decisions.

## VIDEO #6 IO - Cohort - BOSM – W2-M3, V2 (Linear vs Streaming)

**Purpose:** Compare traditional broadcasting to streaming business models
**Placement:** Module 3 (After valuation framework, before simulation)
**Visual Style:** Split-screen comparison with financial models

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]**

**[ANIMATION: Old TV morphing into streaming app]**

**NARRATOR:**
For 50 years, sports media economics were simple: Broadcast games on TV, sell ads, make money.

Then streaming arrived.

Linear TV vs. Streaming: Fundamentally different economics. Let's compare them side-by-side.

---

**[SECTION: REVENUE MODELS - 0:15-0:40]**

**[SPLIT SCREEN: Linear TV left, Streaming right]**

**NARRATOR:**
Revenue Models.

Linear TV: Advertising at 70-80% plus carriage fees at 20-30%. Cable providers distribute sports networks to subscribers. Ad rates: $40-70 per thousand viewers for premium sports.

Streaming: Subscriptions at 80-95% plus optional ads at 5-20%. Fans pay $10-30 per month directly. More predictable revenue—subscribers pay monthly regardless of viewership.

Key difference: Linear monetizes audience. Streaming monetizes subscribers.

**[ON-SCREEN: "Linear = Audience | Streaming = Subscribers"]**

---

**[SECTION: COST STRUCTURES - 0:40-1:05]**

**NARRATOR:**
Cost Structures.

Linear TV: Rights fees at 60-70% plus production at 20-30% plus low distribution costs. Infrastructure already exists—cable networks.

Streaming: Rights fees at 40-50% plus technology at 25-35% plus customer acquisition at 20-30%. Must build platform from scratch—$50-100M initial investment. Customer acquisition cost: $50-200 per subscriber. Front-loaded costs—heavy Year 1-3 investment.

---

**[SECTION: PROFITABILITY & RISKS - 1:05-1:45]**

**NARRATOR:**
Profitability Timelines.

Linear TV: Immediate if priced right. If ad revenue plus carriage fees exceeds rights plus production, you're profitable Day 1. But assumes stable viewership—cord-cutting risk.

Streaming: 3-5 years using customer lifetime value model. Year 1-2: Heavy losses building platform, acquiring customers. Year 3-4: Approaching break-even. Year 5+: Profitability. Requires customer lifetime value exceeding customer acquisition cost.

Key Risks.

Linear TV: Cord-cutting, audience fragmentation, generational shift. Canadian market: Traditional pay TV declined from approximately 11.2 million subscribers in 2014 to 9.7 million in 2024—about 13% decline over a decade.

Streaming: High churn, price sensitivity, competition from tech giants, technology costs. Sports-specific streaming services experience higher seasonal churn driven by sports calendar variations.

---

**[CLOSING - 1:45-2:00]**

**[ANIMATION: Hybrid model illustrated]**

**NARRATOR:**
Most successful strategy? Hybrid. Maintain linear TV cash flow while building streaming for the future.

The risk? Cord-cutting cannibalizes faster than streaming grows. This is what happened to Rogers—lost cable subscribers before gaining enough streaming subscribers.

In your simulation, you'll choose: Linear, streaming, or hybrid?
