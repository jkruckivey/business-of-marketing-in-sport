# Week 2 V3 Redesign: Interactive-First Media Economics

## Executive Summary

### Current State vs. V3 State

**Current Week 2 Structure:**
- Module 3: 6-7 page framework document (15-18 min reading, 1 element)
- Module 5: 10-12 page case study (25-30 min reading, minimal elements)
- **Total reading time:** 40-48 minutes
- **Interactive elements:** 1 widget (Streaming Wars Strategy)
- **Active engagement:** ~15% (mostly passive reading)

**V3 Interactive-First Structure:**
- Module 3: 12 micro-elements with 4 widgets (12-15 min total, 60% active)
- Module 5: 15 micro-elements with 4 widgets (20-25 min total, 65% active)
- **Total engagement time:** 32-40 minutes
- **Interactive elements:** 8 new widgets + 1 existing = 9 total
- **Active engagement:** 75% (hands-on manipulation and discovery)

### Key Metrics Comparison

| Metric | Current (V1) | V3 Interactive-First |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Module 3 Elements** | 6 | 12 |
| **Module 3 Reading Time** | 15-18 min | 5-6 min |
| **Module 3 Interactive Time** | 0 min | 15 min |
| **Module 5 Elements** | 7 | 15 |
| **Module 5 Reading Time** | 25-30 min | 8-10 min |
| **Module 5 Interactive Time** | 0 min | 12 min |
| **Total Text Words** | ~4,500 | ~1,500 |
| **Interactive Widgets** | 1 | 9 |
| **Active Engagement %** | 15% | 75% |

### Rationale for Redesign

**Problem with Current Design:**
1. **Text overload:** 6-7 pages + 10-12 pages = 16-19 pages of continuous reading
2. **Passive learning:** Students read ABOUT concepts instead of experiencing them
3. **Cognitive fatigue:** Long blocks exceed working memory capacity (3-5 min)
4. **Limited engagement:** Single simulation widget insufficient for diverse content
5. **Missing scaffolding:** Complex frameworks (5-factor valuation) presented as text instead of interactive exploration

**V3 Solution - "Show, Don't Tell":**
1. **Micro-chunking:** No text block over 150 words (1 minute reading max)
2. **Interactive demonstrations:** Replace explanations with hands-on manipulation
3. **Mental breaks:** Widget every 2-3 elements prevents cognitive overload
4. **Discovery learning:** Students explore trade-offs and find patterns themselves
5. **Progressive complexity:** Start simple (calculators), build to complex (decision scenarios)

**Research Foundation:**
- **Active Learning (Bonwell & Eison, 1991):** Students construct knowledge through manipulation, not passive reading
- **Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988):** Short chunks + visuals reduce extraneous load
- **Dual Coding Theory (Paivio, 1971):** Text + interaction enhances retention vs. text alone
- **Constructivism (Vygotsky):** Scaffolded experimentation builds deeper mental models
- **UDL Engagement:** Multiple means of engagement through varied modalities

## MODULE 3 REDESIGN: Media Rights Framework
### From 1 Long Document → 12 Micro-Elements with 4 Widgets

**Current Structure (V1):**
- Element 1: 6-7 page framework document (15-18 min reading)
- Element 2: Vertical List (5 valuation factors)
- Element 3: Table (Linear vs. Streaming comparison)
- Element 4: Infobox (Appointment viewing insight)
- Element 5: Details (HBR excerpt - optional)
- Element 6: Image (Fan engagement value chain)

**Problem:** Front-loaded text document creates immediate cognitive overload. Students must read 15-18 minutes before any active engagement.

### Element-by-Element Content Specifications

#### Element 1: Text - Why Media Rights Matter (120 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# Media Rights: The Billion-Dollar Foundation

Media rights—fees paid by broadcasters and streaming platforms to air games—represent the **largest revenue stream** for most professional leagues, typically accounting for **40-60% of total revenue**.

These deals are massive: The NFL's current media rights contracts total **$110 billion over 11 years** ($10B/year). The English Premier League generates over **$5 billion per year** from domestic and international broadcast rights.

**Why sports command premium value:**
- Live games create **"appointment viewing"** (can't watch later without spoilers)
- Sports deliver **simultaneous audiences** (rare in 2024 on-demand world)
- Premium advertising rates: Sports CPM **$50-70** vs. scripted TV **$15-25**

This module explores HOW broadcasters value these rights deals.
```

**Design Note:** Brief introduction sets context, quantifies scale with specific examples, previews the "why" without exhaustive explanation. Students will discover "why" through widgets.

#### Element 2: Video - Media Rights Valuation Overview (2 minutes)

**Video Specifications:**
- **File:** `week2-video1-valuation-framework.mp4`
- **Duration:** 2 minutes
- **VTT Transcript:** `week2-video1-valuation-framework.vtt` (required)
- **Video Title:** "How to Value Sports Media Rights: The 5-Factor Framework"

**Script Content (see `modules/week2/video-scripts/week2-instructional-videos-2min.md` - Video 1):**

```
[0:00-0:15] Introduction
"Media rights deals can reach billions of dollars. How do broadcasters decide what to pay? There are five key factors."

[0:15-0:30] Factor 1: Audience Size
"Larger audiences = higher fees. NFL averages 17M viewers vs. MLS 300K. That's a 50x multiplier in rights fees."

[0:30-0:45] Factor 2: Exclusivity
"Exclusive rights cost 2-3x more than non-exclusive. Bidding wars between networks, streamers, tech companies drive prices higher."

[0:45-1:00] Factor 3: Content Volume
"NHL offers 1,271 games/season. NFL offers 272 games. More games = more inventory for advertising and scheduling."

[1:00-1:15] Factor 4: Brand Alignment
"Premium brands pay premium rates. Rolex sponsors golf/tennis (affluent demos). Monster Energy sponsors UFC/motocross."

[1:15-1:30] Factor 5: Platform Strategy
"Does this property help achieve strategic goals? Traditional broadcasters defend subscribers. Streamers acquire new users. Strategic value exceeds pure ROI."

[1:30-2:00] Conclusion
"These five factors combine to determine rights valuations. Next, you'll use interactive tools to explore how each factor influences deal size. Let's dive in."
```

**Learning Objective:** Introduce the 5-factor framework with clear examples before students explore via widgets.

---

#### Element 3: Vertical List - 5 Valuation Factors at a Glance

Create 5 numbered items:

**Item 1 - Title:** "Audience Size & Demographics"
**Item 1 - Description:** "Larger audiences command higher fees. Coveted demographics (18-49, high income) add premium. Measurement: viewership ratings, subscriber lift, social media reach."

**Item 2 - Title:** "Exclusivity & Competition"
**Item 2 - Description:** "Exclusive rights create bidding wars. Multiple bidders (traditional networks + streamers + tech giants) drive prices up exponentially. Example: NFL Thursday Night Football - Amazon outbid ESPN/NBC."

**Item 3 - Title:** "Content Volume & Flexibility"
**Item 3 - Description:** "More games = more advertising inventory. Live scheduling creates programming certainty (fill 3-hour blocks reliably). NHL 82-game season vs. NFL 17 games affects per-game value."

**Item 4 - Title:** "Brand Alignment & Sponsorship"
**Item 4 - Description:** "Sports properties that align with broadcaster brand attract premium sponsors. Sponsorship revenue offsets rights costs. ESPN+UFC attracts combat sports advertisers (beer, trucks, insurance)."

**Item 5 - Title:** "Platform Strategy Fit"
**Item 5 - Description:** "Does this property help achieve platform goals? Traditional TV: Defend cable subscribers from cord-cutting. Streaming: Acquire new users and reduce churn. Strategic value justifies prices that seem 'too high' on pure ROI."

**Design Note:** Scannable summary reinforces video content. Students can return to this list while using widgets.

#### Element 4: Widget 1 - Audience Size Calculator

**Widget Purpose:** Demonstrate how audience size and demographics drive rights valuations using real league examples.

**How It Works (Student Experience):**
1. Student selects a league from dropdown: NFL, NHL, NBA, MLS, Premier League, or Custom
2. Input fields populate with actual data (or allow custom inputs):
   - Average viewership per game (millions)
   - Number of games per season
   - Total season viewers (millions)
   - Coveted demo % (18-49 with $75K+ income)
   - CPM (cost per thousand viewers) advertising rate
3. Real-time calculations show:
   - Total audience reach (viewers × games)
   - Premium audience value (coveted demo percentage multiplier)
   - Advertising revenue potential (viewers × games × CPM)
   - Estimated annual rights value ($M)
   - Per-game rights value

**Inputs (with real examples):**
- **NFL:** 17M avg viewers, 272 games/season, 45% coveted demo, $70 CPM → **$10B/year**
- **NHL:** 1.5M avg viewers, 1,271 games/season, 35% coveted demo, $45 CPM → **$2B/year**
- **MLS:** 300K avg viewers, 408 games/season, 40% coveted demo, $35 CPM → **$250M/year**
- **Premier League (UK):** 1.8M avg viewers (domestic), 2,280 games/season, 42% coveted demo, $55 CPM → **$5B/year domestic + international**

**Outputs:**
- **Audience Reach:** Total viewers across all games (viewership × games)
- **Premium Multiplier:** Coveted demo percentage (e.g., 45% = 1.45x value)
- **Ad Revenue Potential:** Reach × CPM (shows broadcaster revenue opportunity)
- **Estimated Rights Value:** Total valuation with breakdown by factor
- **Comparison Bar Chart:** Visual comparison of selected league vs. NFL (baseline)

**Learning Objectives:**
- **MLO 2.1:** Understand audience size as primary valuation driver
- Recognize that "total eyeballs" matters more than per-game ratings (NHL vs. NFL)
- Understand demographic premium (why golf/tennis command high CPMs despite smaller audiences)
- Calculate simple rights valuations using audience metrics

**Technical Specifications:**
```javascript
// Core calculation logic
function calculateRightsValue(avgViewers, numGames, covetedDemoPercent, cpm) {
  const totalReach = avgViewers * numGames; // millions of viewer-impressions
  const premiumMultiplier = 1 + (covetedDemoPercent / 100);
  const adRevenuePotential = (totalReach * cpm) / 1000; // CPM conversion
  const estimatedRightsValue = adRevenuePotential * premiumMultiplier * 0.4; // 40% of ad revenue typical

  return {
    totalReach: totalReach.toFixed(1),
    premiumMultiplier: premiumMultiplier.toFixed(2),
    adRevenuePotential: adRevenuePotential.toFixed(0),
    estimatedRightsValue: estimatedRightsValue.toFixed(0),
    perGameValue: (estimatedRightsValue / numGames).toFixed(2)
  };
}
```

**HTML Structure:**
- Dropdown: League selector (5 real leagues + Custom)
- 5 input fields: Avg viewers, # games, coveted demo %, CPM, contract length (years)
- Results panel: 5 calculated metrics with icons
- Bar chart: Visual comparison to NFL baseline
- Export button: Download calculations as JSON

**Accessibility:**
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (Tab through inputs, Enter to calculate)
- ✅ ARIA labels on all inputs ("Average viewership per game in millions")
- ✅ Screen reader announcements for calculated results
- ✅ High contrast mode support (text on #fafafa background)
- ✅ Focus indicators (3px solid outline)

**Implementation Time:** 4-5 hours (form inputs + calculations + bar chart visualization)

**Status:** ⭕ Needs to be built (Phase 1 priority)

#### Element 5: Text - Exclusivity & Competition Dynamics (150 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# Exclusivity Creates Bidding Wars

**Exclusive rights** cost 2-3x more than non-exclusive packages—but they're worth it for strategic reasons.

## Why Exclusivity Matters

**For Broadcasters:**
- Exclusive content can't be found elsewhere (drives subscriptions and viewership)
- Differentiation in crowded streaming market (e.g., Apple TV+ with MLS, Amazon with NFL Thursday)
- Bundling power: "Watch YOUR team only on our platform"

**For Leagues:**
- Multiple bidders drive prices up exponentially
- Competition between traditional networks, streamers (Netflix, Apple, Amazon), and tech giants (Google, Meta)
- Example: NFL split packages across CBS, FOX, NBC, ESPN, Amazon—maximized total value

## The Bidding War Dynamic

When Amazon entered NFL rights bidding (2021), traditional networks had to raise bids to compete. Result: NFL rights increased 75% from previous deal despite stable ratings.

**Next: Experience exclusivity bidding through simulation.**
```

**Design Note:** Explains WHY exclusivity commands premium without excessive detail. Sets up widget where students will experience bidding dynamics firsthand.

---

#### Element 6: Widget 2 - Exclusivity Bidding Simulator

**Widget Purpose:** Let students experience competitive bidding dynamics and understand why exclusive rights command premium prices.

**How It Works (Student Experience):**
1. **Scenario Setup:** You are the NHL commissioner in 2025. Three bidders want Canadian national rights (current Rogers deal expires 2026):
   - **Rogers (incumbent):** Traditional broadcaster, Sportsnet platform, defensive strategy
   - **DAZN (streaming disruptor):** Global sports streamer, aggressive growth strategy
   - **Apple TV+ (tech giant):** New sports entrant, deep pockets, strategic expansion

2. **Bidding Interface:**
   - Student sets minimum acceptable bid: $400M/year (floor based on current deal)
   - Bidders submit sealed bids (reveal one at a time for drama)
   - Student can choose: Accept highest bid OR split rights (non-exclusive)

3. **Three Scenarios to Explore:**
   - **Scenario A - Exclusive Rights:** Single winner, highest bidder gets all games
   - **Scenario B - Split Package:** Regional (Sportsnet) + National (DAZN) + Streaming (Apple)
   - **Scenario C - Maximum Competition:** Invite 2 more bidders (Amazon, TSN) and re-run

4. **Reveal Bids with Context:**
   - **Rogers:** $450M/year (cautious, lost money on previous deal, wants regional only)
   - **DAZN:** $550M/year (aggressive, needs anchor content for Canada)
   - **Apple TV+:** $700M/year (strategic not financial decision, deep pockets, global ambitions)

5. **Student Decision:** Accept Apple's $700M exclusive OR Split rights (Rogers $450M regional + DAZN $400M national + Apple $300M streaming = $1.15B total but non-exclusive)

6. **Outcomes:**
   - **Exclusive Apple Deal ($700M/year):** Pros: Predictable revenue, single partner relationship, global reach. Cons: Canadian fans need Apple TV+ subscription ($12.99/month), accessibility concerns, lower total revenue vs. split package.
   - **Split Package ($1.15B/year):** Pros: 64% higher revenue, multiple revenue streams, better Canadian accessibility. Cons: Complex negotiations, potential conflicts between partners, coordination challenges.

**Learning Objectives:**
- **MLO 2.1:** Understand exclusivity premium (single bidder vs. split packages)
- Experience competitive bidding dynamics (how tech giants drive prices up)
- Recognize trade-offs: Highest bidder vs. accessibility vs. total revenue
- Understand strategic bidding (Apple pays "too much" for strategic reasons, not ROI)

**Outputs:**
- **Total Deal Value:** Per-year and total contract value (assume 10 years)
- **Revenue Comparison:** Selected option vs. alternatives (bar chart)
- **Strategic Insights:** 3-5 bullet points explaining bidder motivations
- **NHL Perspective:** What league prioritizes (revenue, reach, fan accessibility)

**Real-World Context:**
- NFL split packages: CBS, FOX, NBC, ESPN/ABC, Amazon Prime Video, NFL+ (maximize competition)
- MLS exclusive to Apple TV+ ($2.5B over 10 years, 2023-2032)
- NHL's current Rogers exclusive deal ($5.2B/12 years, 2014-2026) vs. previous split package

**Technical Specifications:**
```javascript
const bidders = [
  {
    name: "Rogers (Incumbent)",
    logo: "rogers-logo.png",
    bid: 450,
    rationale: "Lost money on 2014 deal. Risk-averse. Prefers regional rights only.",
    strengths: "Established Canadian broadcaster. Sportsnet brand recognition.",
    weaknesses: "Cord-cutting impact. Sportsnet NOW underperformed (450K subs vs. 1M target)."
  },
  {
    name: "DAZN (Global Streamer)",
    bid: 550,
    rationale: "Needs anchor content for Canadian market. Aggressive growth strategy.",
    strengths: "Multi-sport platform (soccer, boxing, NFL). Lower subscription price ($24.99).",
    weaknesses: "Smaller Canadian subscriber base (300K). No traditional broadcast reach."
  },
  {
    name: "Apple TV+ (Tech Giant)",
    bid: 700,
    rationale: "Strategic acquisition. Deep pockets. Global sports expansion (MLS success).",
    strengths: "2B+ Apple device ecosystem. Premium production quality. Global reach.",
    weaknesses: "Subscription barrier ($12.99/month). Less sports credibility than ESPN/TSN."
  }
];

function calculatePackageValue(exclusiveOption, splitOptions) {
  if (exclusiveOption) {
    return {
      annual: exclusiveOption.bid,
      total: exclusiveOption.bid * 10, // 10-year deal
      type: "Exclusive",
      partner: exclusiveOption.name
    };
  } else {
    const annualTotal = splitOptions.reduce((sum, option) => sum + option.bid, 0);
    return {
      annual: annualTotal,
      total: annualTotal * 10,
      type: "Split Package",
      partners: splitOptions.map(o => o.name).join(", ")
    };
  }
}
```

**HTML Structure:**
- Header: Scenario description + commissioner role
- Bidder cards: 3 cards with logos, bids (hidden initially), rationales
- Action buttons: "Reveal Bids" → "Accept Exclusive" OR "Split Package"
- Results panel: Total value, comparison chart, strategic insights
- Reset button: Try different scenarios

**Accessibility:**
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (Tab through bidders, Enter to reveal/select)
- ✅ ARIA live regions for bid reveals ("DAZN bids $550 million per year")
- ✅ Screen reader compatible bid cards with full context
- ✅ High contrast mode for bid amounts and charts
- ✅ Focus indicators on interactive cards

**Implementation Time:** 5-6 hours (card interaction, reveal animation, comparison logic)

**Status:** ⭕ Needs to be built (Phase 1 priority - high pedagogical value)

#### Element 7: Infobox - Key Insight: Appointment Viewing

```
Title: ▶ Key Insight: "Appointment Viewing" in an On-Demand World

Sports are the last true appointment viewing. You can't watch a game "later" without risking spoilers from social media, friends, or news alerts. This creates:

• Predictable, simultaneous audience (rare in 2024)
• Premium advertising rates (live = engaged = valuable)
• Subscription retention power (can't cancel during season)
• Cultural currency ("Did you see that play?")

This unique characteristic explains why sports rights command prices that seem economically irrational—until you understand their strategic defensive value for traditional broadcasters and offensive value for streaming disruptors.
```

**Design Note:** Yellow Infobox (Note variant). Strategic placement after exclusivity concepts reinforces WHY bidders compete so aggressively. This insight applies to both traditional and streaming platforms.

#### Element 8: Text - Linear TV vs. Streaming Intro (120 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# Two Business Models, Different Economics

Traditional linear broadcasting and direct-to-consumer streaming have **fundamentally different economics**—which explains why sports rights deals are structured differently for each platform.

## Linear TV (Traditional Broadcasting)
- **Revenue:** Advertising (80%) + carriage fees from cable/satellite providers (20%)
- **Goal:** Maximize viewership to sell ads at premium rates
- **Timeline:** Immediate profitability expected (if deal priced correctly)
- **Risk:** Cord-cutting and audience fragmentation

## Streaming/DTC (Direct-to-Consumer)
- **Revenue:** Subscriptions (90%) + advertising tier (10%)
- **Goal:** Acquire and retain subscribers (customer lifetime value thinking)
- **Timeline:** 3-5 year payback period (invest in growth first)
- **Risk:** Subscriber churn and price sensitivity

**Next: Compare models side-by-side and explore trade-offs.**
```

**Design Note:** Sets up platform comparison without exhaustive detail. Students will explore implications through table and widget.

---

#### Element 9: Table - Platform Economics Comparison

| **Model** | **Revenue Sources** | **Cost Structure** | **Key Risks** | **Profitability Timeline** | **Sports Strategy** |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **Linear TV** | Ad revenue (80%)<br>Carriage fees (20%) | Rights fees<br>Production costs | Cord-cutting<br>Audience fragmentation | Immediate (if priced right) | Defend subscribers<br>Must-have to prevent cancellation |
| **Streaming/DTC** | Subscriptions (90%)<br>Advertising tier (10%) | Rights fees<br>Technology infrastructure<br>Customer acquisition costs | Subscriber churn<br>Price sensitivity<br>Content overload | 3-5 years (customer LTV model) | Acquire new users<br>Reduce churn with exclusive sports |

**Table Note:** "Economics vary significantly by property and market. These represent typical patterns for major sports rights deals in 2024."

**Design Note:** Side-by-side comparison enables direct contrast. Students scan visually before exploring implications via widget.

---

#### Element 10: Widget 3 - Platform Economics Visualizer

**Widget Purpose:** Let students manipulate platform economics variables and see how profitability timelines differ between linear TV and streaming models.

**How It Works (Student Experience):**
1. **Choose Platform:** Toggle between Linear TV and Streaming/DTC
2. **Set Rights Cost:** Slider from $100M-$1B per year (represents NHL, NBA, NFL tiers)
3. **Adjust Revenue Drivers:**
   - **Linear TV:** Ad rate (CPM), carriage fee per subscriber, total subscribers
   - **Streaming:** Subscription price ($9.99-$29.99), subscriber growth rate (%), churn rate (%)
4. **View 10-Year Projection:**
   - Annual revenue line (grows or shrinks based on inputs)
   - Annual costs line (rights + production/tech)
   - Profitability point (when revenue exceeds costs)
   - Cumulative profit/loss (total over 10 years)
5. **Real-World Scenarios (Presets):**
   - **Rogers NHL Deal (Linear):** $433M/year rights, declining subscribers, never profitable
   - **DAZN Canada (Streaming):** $50M/year rights portfolio, 300K subs → 500K growth, profitable Year 4
   - **Apple TV+ MLS (Streaming):** $250M/year rights, aggressive 0 → 2M sub growth, profitable Year 5

**Inputs:**

**For Linear TV:**
- Rights cost: $100M-$1B/year (slider)
- Ad CPM: $30-$80 (slider) - reflects premium for sports
- Carriage fee per subscriber: $0.50-$3.00/month (slider)
- Starting subscribers: 5M-12M (slider)
- Annual subscriber decline: 3%-8%/year (slider) - reflects cord-cutting

**For Streaming/DTC:**
- Rights cost: $100M-$1B/year (slider)
- Subscription price: $9.99-$29.99/month (slider)
- Starting subscribers: 0-500K (slider)
- Monthly subscriber growth: 5%-25% (slider) - early growth rate
- Churn rate: 5%-20%/month (slider)
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC): $25-$100 per subscriber (slider)

**Outputs:**
- **10-Year Line Chart:**
  - Blue line: Annual revenue
  - Red line: Annual costs (rights + production/CAC)
  - Green shaded area: Profitability (when blue > red)
- **Key Metrics:**
  - Break-even year (or "Never" if doesn't happen in 10 years)
  - Cumulative profit/loss over 10 years
  - Peak subscriber count
  - Average annual revenue (Years 1-10)
- **Strategic Insights (Dynamic):**
  - "Linear TV struggles due to subscriber decline exceeding ad revenue growth" (if declining)
  - "Streaming achieves profitability in Year 5 due to low churn and steady growth" (if successful)
  - "High churn rate (15%+) prevents streaming profitability—focus on retention" (if high churn)

**Learning Objectives:**
- **MLO 2.2:** Compare linear vs. streaming profitability timelines through manipulation
- Understand why streaming "loses money for years" (investment in subscriber base)
- Recognize cord-cutting impact on linear TV economics
- Appreciate why tech giants can "overpay" (long-term LTV thinking vs. immediate ROI)

**Real-World Examples (Built into presets):**

**Preset 1: Rogers NHL Deal (Linear TV) - The Cautionary Tale**
- Rights: $433M/year
- Starting subscribers: 11.2M (2014)
- Ending subscribers: 8.1M (2024) [~28% decline]
- Ad revenue: $300M → $200M (cord-cutting + rating decline)
- **Result:** NEVER profitable (cumulative loss ~$1.5B over 10 years)
- **Lesson:** Linear TV model vulnerable when subscriber decline accelerates

**Preset 2: DAZN Canada (Streaming) - Slow and Steady**
- Rights: $50M/year (multi-sport portfolio)
- Subscription: $24.99/month
- Growth: 50K → 300K → 500K subscribers (Years 1-5)
- Churn: 8%/month (average for sports streaming)
- **Result:** Profitable Year 4 (cumulative +$200M by Year 10)
- **Lesson:** Lower rights costs + steady growth = sustainable streaming model

**Preset 3: Apple TV+ MLS (Streaming) - Big Bet**
- Rights: $250M/year
- Subscription: $12.99/month (Season Pass)
- Growth: 0 → 500K → 1.5M → 2M subscribers (Years 1-5)
- Churn: 12%/month (high due to seasonal interest)
- **Result:** Profitable Year 5 IF subscriber targets met (cumulative +$500M by Year 10)
- **Lesson:** High upfront costs require aggressive growth—strategic long-term play

#### Element 11: Text - Fan Engagement Monetization (150 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# Beyond Passive Viewing: Engagement as Revenue Driver

Modern sports monetization extends beyond passive viewing. **Active fan engagement** creates multiple revenue streams and increases customer lifetime value.

## The Engagement Value Chain

**Passive Viewer** (Low Value):
- Watches games occasionally
- Generates: Advertising impressions, basic viewership metrics
- Value: $5-15/year

**Engaged Fan** (Medium Value):
- Watches regularly + uses team app + follows on social media
- Generates: Premium ad rates, app sponsorship opportunities, first-party data
- Value: $50-100/year

**Super-Fan** (High Value):
- Watches everything + fantasy sports + betting + exclusive content subscriptions
- Generates: Premium subscriptions, betting partnerships, exclusive content monetization
- Value: $300-500+/year

## Why Engagement Matters for Rights Deals

Platforms that drive engagement (interactive features, fantasy integration, betting) justify higher rights costs because they extract more value per viewer.

**Next: Build your own engagement value chain.**
```

**Design Note:** Frames fan engagement as a progression (passive → engaged → super-fan) with clear monetization at each level. Sets up widget where students will build value chains.

---

#### Element 12: Widget 4 - Engagement Value Chain Builder

**Widget Purpose:** Let students construct an engagement strategy and see how different tactics increase fan value and justify higher rights costs.

**How It Works (Student Experience):**
1. **Choose Your Property:** Select sport type (NHL, NBA, MLS, NFL, EPL)
2. **Set Baseline:**
   - Starting fans: 1M (adjust with slider)
   - Passive viewer value: $10/year (average)
3. **Select Engagement Tactics (Checkboxes with costs/benefits):**
   - **Mobile App** (+$2M/year cost → 30% fans download → +$5/fan/year value)
   - **Fantasy Integration** (+$500K/year cost → 15% participate → +$15/fan/year value)
   - **Betting Partnerships** (Revenue share → 10% engage → +$30/fan/year value)
   - **Exclusive Content** (+$3M/year cost → 20% subscribe → +$25/fan/year value)
   - **Social Media Strategy** (+$1M/year cost → 50% follow → +$8/fan/year value)
   - **Gamification** (+$1.5M/year cost → 25% participate → +$12/fan/year value)
4. **View Engagement Funnel:**
   - Passive viewers: 1M (baseline)
   - Mobile app users: 300K (30% of 1M)
   - Fantasy participants: 150K (15% of 1M)
   - Betting fans: 100K (10% of 1M)
   - Exclusive content subscribers: 200K (20% of 1M)
5. **Calculate Total Value:**
   - Passive viewer revenue: 1M × $10 = $10M/year
   - Engaged fan revenue: [calculations for each tactic]
   - **Total fan value: $XX.XM/year**
   - **ROI:** (Total value - tactics cost) / tactics cost
   - **Rights justification:** "With engagement strategy, you can afford up to $XXM/year in rights fees while maintaining 30% profit margin"

**Engagement Tactics Detail:**

**Tactic 1: Mobile App**
- **Cost:** $2M/year (development, maintenance, push notifications)
- **Adoption:** 30% of fans download app
- **Value per engaged fan:** +$5/year (in-app ads, location data, push notification sponsorships)
- **Example:** NHL app with live scores, highlights, behind-the-scenes content

**Tactic 2: Fantasy Integration**
- **Cost:** $500K/year (partnership with DraftKings/FanDuel or build in-house)
- **Adoption:** 15% participate in fantasy leagues
- **Value per engaged fan:** +$15/year (platform revenue share, increased game viewership)
- **Example:** NBA fantasy leagues drive 25% more game viewing (in-game bets on player props)

**Tactic 3: Betting Partnerships**
- **Cost:** $0 upfront (revenue share model with operators)
- **Adoption:** 10% of fans bet on games
- **Value per engaged fan:** +$30/year (operator revenue share, in-game betting viewership increase)
- **Example:** NHL-MGM partnership, FanDuel NFL integration

**Tactic 4: Exclusive Content Subscriptions**
- **Cost:** $3M/year (production of documentaries, player features, tactical analysis)
- **Adoption:** 20% subscribe to premium tier
- **Value per engaged fan:** +$25/year (subscription revenue $10/month × 12 months)
- **Example:** MLS Season Pass exclusive content, F1TV Pro

**Tactic 5: Social Media Strategy**
- **Cost:** $1M/year (content team, influencer partnerships, community management)
- **Adoption:** 50% follow on social platforms
- **Value per engaged fan:** +$8/year (social ad revenue, influencer sponsorships, UGC content)
- **Example:** Premier League TikTok highlights, NFL RedZone Twitter engagement

**Tactic 6: Gamification & Challenges**
- **Cost:** $1.5M/year (prediction games, leaderboards, rewards program)
- **Adoption:** 25% participate in challenges
- **Value per engaged fan:** +$12/year (sponsor-branded challenges, increased engagement time)
- **Example:** NBA Pick'em, NHL Playoff Bracket Challenge

**Outputs:**
- **Engagement Funnel Visualization:** Stacked bars showing passive → engaged → super-fan progression
- **Revenue Breakdown:**
  - Baseline (passive only): $10M
  - With engagement tactics: $XX.XM (shows increase)
  - Tactics cost: $X.XM
  - Net gain: $XX.XM
  - ROI: XXX%
- **Rights Affordability Calculator:**
  - If you maintain 30% profit margin, you can afford: $XX.XM/year in rights fees
  - Comparison: Without engagement, only $7M/year affordable
  - **Difference: Engagement tactics justify 2-3x higher rights costs**
- **Strategic Insights:**
  - "Betting integration provides highest value per engaged fan (+$30) but lowest adoption (10%)"
  - "Social media has highest reach (50%) but lowest value per fan (+$8)—mass market strategy"
  - "Exclusive content requires upfront investment ($3M) but creates sustainable subscription revenue"

**Learning Objectives:**
- **MLO 2.3:** Understand how fan engagement extends monetization beyond passive viewing
- Recognize that engagement tactics justify higher rights costs (increase revenue per fan)
- Evaluate trade-offs: High-cost, high-value (exclusive content) vs. low-cost, broad reach (social media)
- Understand why platforms with engagement capabilities (apps, betting, fantasy) pay more for rights

**Real-World Examples (built into widget):**

**Example 1: NBA + DraftKings**
- Fantasy integration (15% adoption)
- Betting partnership (10% adoption)
- Result: Fan value increased from $12/year → $45/year
- Justifies NBA's $24B rights deals (1.5x previous deal despite flat ratings)

**Example 2: Premier League + Social Media**
- TikTok highlights strategy (50% fan reach)
- Instagram global fan engagement (60% reach)
- Result: International fan value increased from $5/year → $18/year
- Justifies $5B+ international rights fees

### Element-by-Element Content Specifications

#### Element 1: Infobox - Case Overview

```
Title: Case Study: Rogers Communications - The $5.2 Billion NHL Bet ▸

Context:
In 2013, Rogers Communications shocked the sports media world by paying $5.2 billion for exclusive Canadian NHL rights—12 years, all platforms, all games. It was the largest sports media deal in Canadian history and a massive strategic bet on hockey's enduring value.

Key Questions for Analysis:
1. How did Rogers value the NHL rights at $5.2 billion? What assumptions did they make?
2. What were the strategic goals beyond pure ROI (e.g., brand positioning, competitive defense)?
3. How did the deal perform vs. expectations? What went right and wrong?
4. What should Rogers do in 2026 when the deal expires?

This case addresses all Week 2 MLOs:
• MLO 2.1: Rights valuation methodology
• MLO 2.2: Platform strategy (linear Sportsnet + streaming)
• MLO 2.3: Fan engagement and monetization tactics
• MLO 2.4: Evaluation of mega-deal success/failure
```

**Design Note:** Blue Callout variant. Frames case with clear questions (scaffolding for analysis). Connects to MLOs explicitly.

#### Element 2: Text - Case Background (150 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# Rogers Communications: Company Background (2013)

**Who:** Rogers Communications, Canada's largest telecommunications and media company. In 2013, Rogers owned:
- Rogers Wireless (largest mobile carrier, 9.5M subscribers)
- Rogers Cable (cable TV and internet, 2.3M subscribers)
- **Sportsnet** (sports broadcasting network, distant #2 to TSN)

**Strategic Challenge:** By 2013, Rogers faced existential threats:
- Cord-cutting accelerating (cable subscribers declining 5%/year)
- TSN (Bell Media) dominated sports broadcasting with NHL, NBA, CFL, FIFA
- Netflix and streaming disrupting traditional TV

**The Opportunity:** NHL's Canadian rights deal with CBC/TSN was expiring in 2014. Rogers saw a chance to acquire the crown jewel of Canadian sports and transform Sportsnet from challenger to leader.

**The Stakes:** A $5.2B bet—equivalent to 15% of Rogers' entire market capitalization. Success could secure Rogers' media future. Failure could cripple the company for a decade.

**Next: Explore the deal terms and what Rogers got for $5.2 billion.**
```

**Design Note:** Sets up context efficiently. Establishes stakes (15% of market cap) to help students understand risk magnitude.

   - **Revenue Projections:** What Rogers expected to earn
   - **Comparison to Previous Deal:** How much more Rogers paid
3. **Tab Content:**

**Tab 1: Rights Included**
- ✅ All national games (Hockey Night in Canada - Saturday nights)

- ✅ All playoff games (Stanley Cup Playoffs - Canadian teams + all rounds)
- ✅ International tournaments (World Cup of Hockey, Olympics qualifier games)
- ✅ Shoulder programming (pre-game, post-game, highlight shows)
- **Total:** 1,000+ games per season + shoulder content

**Tab 2: Platforms Covered**

- 📱 Streaming: Sportsnet NOW (subscription service, launched 2016)
- 💻 Digital: Sportsnet.ca website, mobile apps
- 📻 Radio: Sportsnet Radio network
- **Flexibility:** Rogers controlled all platforms (could shift games based on strategy)

**Tab 3: Exclusivity Terms**
- 🚫 TSN lost national rights (previously co-held with CBC)
- 🚫 CBC retained Hockey Night in Canada brand but sublicensed from Rogers (free over-air broadcast Saturdays)
- 🚫 No other Canadian broadcaster could show NHL games (except CBC sublicense)
- ✅ Regional rights for some teams retained by others (e.g., TSN had regional Ottawa Senators rights)
- **Result:** Rogers had near-monopoly on NHL content in Canada

**Tab 4: Revenue Projections (Rogers' Internal Forecast)**
- **Year 1 (2014-15):** $300M revenue (advertising + Sportsnet NOW subscriptions)
- **Year 3 (2016-17):** $425M revenue (subscriber growth + premium ad rates)
- **Year 5 (2018-19):** $500M revenue (break-even point)
- **Year 7 (2020-21):** $550M revenue (sustained profitability)
- **Assumptions:** 1M Sportsnet NOW subscribers by Year 5 @ $25/month + stable linear TV ad revenue

**Tab 5: Comparison to Previous Deal**
- **Previous (CBC/TSN 2004-2014):** $1.4B over 10 years = $140M/year
- **Rogers (2014-2026):** $5.2B over 12 years = $433M/year
- **Increase:** 209% higher per year ($433M vs. $140M)
- **Per-game cost:** Previous: $140K/game → Rogers: $433K/game (3x increase)
- **Justification:** Exclusivity premium + digital rights + inflation + NHL's growing Canadian fanbase

**Interactive Features:**
- Click each tab to reveal content with smooth animations
- Hover over metrics to see tooltips with definitions
- Toggle "Show Previous Deal" overlay for direct comparison
- Export button: Download deal terms summary as PDF

**Learning Objectives:**
- **MLO 2.4:** Understand comprehensive scope of rights deal (not just TV games)

# Why Rogers Paid $5.2 Billion: The Strategic Rationale

Rogers' board approved the $5.2B bid despite knowing it would lose money for 3-5 years. **Why?**

## Defensive Strategy: Protect the Core Business
- Cable subscribers were cancelling at 5%/year (cord-cutting accelerating)
- NHL games were **the #1 reason Canadians kept cable** (survey: 42% said "hockey" was must-have)
- Losing NHL rights would accelerate cord-cutting → death spiral for cable business
- **Logic:** Pay $433M/year to prevent $1B+/year cable revenue loss

## Offensive Strategy: Build Streaming Brand
- Sportsnet NOW (streaming service) launched 2016 with NHL as exclusive content
- Target: 1M+ subscribers by Year 5 @ $25/month = $300M/year new revenue
- Position Sportsnet as **Canada's sports streaming destination** before Netflix, DAZN, Apple entered

## Competitive Defense: Hurt TSN (Bell Media)
- TSN (Rogers' main competitor) lost national NHL rights
- Weakened TSN's #1 sports brand positioning
- Rogers could justify cable carriage fee increases ("We have NHL, TSN doesn't")

**Next: What actually happened? (Spoiler: Most assumptions proved wrong)**
```

**Design Note:** Explains rationale in business terms (defensive, offensive, competitive). Sets up dramatic contrast with next section (reality vs. expectations).

- **Video Title:** "Rogers NHL Deal: 10 Years Later - What Went Wrong (and Right)"

**Script Content:**

```
[0:00-0:20] Introduction
"In 2013, Rogers bet $5.2 billion on NHL hockey. Ten years later, the deal is widely considered a financial disaster. But was it a complete failure? Let's analyze what went right and wrong."

[0:20-0:45] What Went Wrong
"Three major miscalculations sank profitability:
1. Cord-cutting accelerated faster than projected—cable subscribers declined 28% vs. 15% expected
2. Sportsnet NOW reached only 450K subscribers vs. 1M target—exclusive hockey wasn't enough
3. COVID-19 devastated Year 7 revenue (projected $550M, actual $200M)—no force majeure clause in contract"

[0:45-1:10] What Went Right (Sort Of)
"Rogers DID achieve some strategic goals:
1. Defended cable subscribers—without NHL, decline would've been 35-40% instead of 28%
2. Established Sportsnet as Canada's sports brand—brand value increased despite financial losses
3. Built streaming infrastructure—Sportsnet NOW technology platform now supports other content"

[1:10-1:35] The Financial Reality
"Cumulative losses estimated at $1.5 billion over 10 years. Annual losses: $50-150M/year.
Rogers never achieved profitability. Break-even pushed from Year 5 → Year 7 → Never."

[1:35-2:00] 2026 Decision Ahead
"Contract expires 2026. Rogers must decide: Renew? Renegotiate? Walk away?
NHL knows Rogers overpaid. Next deal will likely be 30-40% less ($300M/year range).
Question: Is NHL still worth it at ANY price given streaming disruption?"
```

**Learning Objective:** Provide executive perspective on deal performance BEFORE students dive into data. Frames key issues (cord-cutting, subscriber shortfall, COVID).

#### Element 6: Text - Performance Overview (150 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# What Actually Happened: 2014-2024 Performance

Rogers' optimistic projections collided with harsh market realities.

## Financial Performance (vs. Projections)
- **Year 1:** Revenue $280M (projected $300M) ❌ Below target
- **Year 3:** Revenue $310M (projected $425M) ❌ 27% shortfall
- **Year 5:** Revenue $350M (projected $500M) ❌ 30% shortfall
- **Year 7 (COVID):** Revenue $200M (projected $550M) ❌ 64% shortfall
- **Year 10:** Revenue $380M (projected $600M+) ❌ Still unprofitable

## Three Critical Failures
1. **Advertising Revenue Collapsed:** Cord-cutting reduced linear TV viewership faster than Sportsnet NOW growth offset it
2. **Streaming Underperformance:** 450K subscribers vs. 1M target (55% shortfall) → $150M/year revenue gap
3. **No Flexibility:** Contract had no force majeure clause—COVID losses couldn't be renegotiated

**Cumulative Result:** $1.5B+ total losses over 10 years. Never achieved profitability.

**Next: Explore the data behind these failures.**

#### Element 7: Widget 6 - Projections vs. Actuals Visualizer

**Widget Purpose:** Let students interactively compare Rogers' financial projections with actual performance, identifying variance drivers.

**How It Works (Student Experience):**
1. **10-Year Timeline (2014-2024):**
   - X-axis: Years 1-10
   - Y-axis: Revenue in $M (0-$700M)
2. **Three Lines on Chart:**
   - **Blue line:** Projected revenue (Rogers' original forecast)
   - **Red line:** Actual revenue (what really happened)
   - **Green line:** Break-even point ($433M/year) - horizontal line
3. **Interactive Scrubber:**
   - Drag slider across Years 1-10
   - Hover over any year to see detailed breakdown
4. **Year Detail Panel (when hovering):**
   - **Projected:** $XXM
   - **Actual:** $XXM
   - **Variance:** $XXM (XX% below/above)
   - **Key Event:** What happened that year (e.g., "Sportsnet NOW launched", "COVID-19 pandemic", "Canadian teams missed playoffs")
5. **Variance Breakdown (Select any year):**
   - **Advertising Revenue:** Projected vs. Actual
   - **Subscription Revenue (Sportsnet NOW):** Projected vs. Actual
   - **Carriage Fees:** Projected vs. Actual
   - **Total Costs:** $433M (fixed)
   - **Operating Profit/Loss:** (Total Revenue - $433M)

**Data Table (Pre-loaded):**

| Year | Projected Revenue | Actual Revenue | Variance | Key Event | Ad Revenue | Subs Revenue | Carriage Fees |
|------|------------------|----------------|----------|-----------|------------|--------------|---------------|
| 1 (2014-15) | $300M | $280M | -$20M (-7%) | Weak Canadian teams (only 1 in playoffs) | $190M | $10M | $80M |
| 2 (2015-16) | $350M | $290M | -$60M (-17%) | Cord-cutting accelerates | $180M | $25M | $85M |
| 3 (2016-17) | $425M | $310M | -$115M (-27%) | Sportsnet NOW slow adoption | $170M | $48M | $92M |
| 4 (2017-18) | $450M | $330M | -$120M (-27%) | Linear TV viewership decline | $165M | $70M | $95M |
| 5 (2018-19) | $500M | $350M | -$150M (-30%) | Target: 1M subs, Actual: 350K | $160M | $105M | $85M |
| 6 (2019-20) | $525M | $360M | -$165M (-31%) | Pre-COVID, continued decline | $155M | $120M | $85M |
| 7 (2020-21) | $550M | $200M | -$350M (-64%) | **COVID-19:** No fans, shortened season | $80M | $100M | $20M |
| 8 (2021-22) | $575M | $340M | -$235M (-41%) | Partial recovery, bubble playoffs | $150M | $130M | $60M |
| 9 (2022-23) | $600M | $370M | -$230M (-38%) | Return to normal, but lower viewership | $160M | $145M | $65M |
| 10 (2023-24) | $625M | $380M | -$245M (-39%) | **Current:** Still unprofitable | $165M | $151M | $64M |

**Insights Panel (Generated based on year selected):**

**Year 1 Insight:**
"Rogers started below target due to weak Canadian team performance. Only one Canadian team (Montreal) made playoffs, reducing ad revenue by $20M. Early warning sign."

**Year 3 Insight:**
"Sportsnet NOW subscriber growth slower than expected (200K actual vs. 500K target). Canadians reluctant to pay $25/month for hockey-only streaming service."

**Year 5 Insight:**
"Critical failure point: Sportsnet NOW reached only 350K subscribers (vs. 1M target). $150M annual revenue shortfall. Break-even pushed from Year 5 to Year 7."

**Year 7 (COVID) Insight:**
"Catastrophic year. COVID-19 shortened season (56 games instead of 82), no fans, bubble playoffs. Revenue collapsed 64%. No force majeure clause in contract—Rogers absorbed full loss."

**Year 10 Insight:**
"Despite 10 years, Rogers never achieved profitability. Cumulative losses: ~$1.5B. Deal expires 2026. Rogers must decide: Renew at lower price? Walk away?"

#### Element 8: Infobox - Key Insight: Why Forecasts Failed

```
Title: ▶ Critical Insight: The Forecasting Failure

Rogers' projections failed for three interconnected reasons:

1. **Underestimated Cord-Cutting Speed**
   - Assumed linear TV would decline 15% over 10 years
   - Actual: 28% decline (nearly double)
   - Impact: $150M/year advertising revenue shortfall

2. **Overestimated Streaming Adoption**
   - Assumed NHL-only service would attract 1M+ subscribers
   - Actual: Hockey alone wasn't enough—fans wanted multi-sport (DAZN model)
   - Impact: $150M/year subscription revenue shortfall

3. **No Scenario Planning for Black Swan Events**
   - Contract had no force majeure clause (COVID, lockouts, other disruptions)
   - Impact: $350M loss in Year 7 with no recourse

**Lesson:** Media rights deals require scenario planning. Rogers optimized for "base case" and had no hedge for downside risks. NHL's next deal will include flexibility clauses.
```

**Design Note:** Yellow Infobox (Note variant). Synthesizes the three failure modes AFTER students explored data via widget. This reinforces pattern recognition.

#### Element 9: Text - Audience Trends (150 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# Viewership Trends: The Audience Story

Beyond financial projections, Rogers faced declining and fragmented audiences.

## National Broadcast Ratings (Hockey Night in Canada)
- **2013-14 (Pre-Rogers):** 1.8M average viewers (baseline)
- **2014-15 (Year 1):** 1.6M viewers (-11%) ⬇️ Weak Canadian teams
- **2023-24 (Year 10):** 1.3M viewers (-28% vs. baseline) ⬇️ Continued erosion

## Why Viewership Declined
1. **Canadian Team Performance:** Only 1-2 Canadian teams made playoffs most years (reduces "must-watch" games)
2. **Generational Shift:** Younger audiences (18-34) prefer highlights and social clips over 3-hour games
3. **Competition:** More viewing options (Netflix, gaming, other sports) fragment attention

## Sportsnet NOW Subscriber Growth (Too Slow)
- **2016 (Launch):** 50K subscribers
- **2020 (Target Year 5):** 350K subscribers (vs. 1M target)
- **2024 (Current):** 450K subscribers ⬆️ Growth stalled

**Lesson:** Exclusive content isn't enough if underlying audience is declining. Rogers needed multi-sport strategy like DAZN.

**Next: Explore viewership data interactively.**
```

**Design Note:** Frames viewership decline with specific numbers (down arrows provide visual emphasis). Sets up widget for data exploration.

#### Element 10: Widget 7 - Viewership Trends Analyzer

**Widget Purpose:** Let students explore Hockey Night in Canada viewership trends, subscriber growth, and audience demographics to understand market dynamics.

**How It Works (Student Experience):**
1. **Three Tabs to Explore:**
   - **Tab 1: Linear TV Ratings** (Hockey Night in Canada viewership 2014-2024)
   - **Tab 2: Sportsnet NOW Subscribers** (Streaming growth vs. targets)
   - **Tab 3: Demographic Breakdown** (Age, gender, regional trends)

**Tab 1: Linear TV Ratings (Interactive Line Chart)**

**Chart Setup:**
- X-axis: Seasons (2013-14 through 2023-24)
- Y-axis: Average viewers per game (millions, 0-2.5M)
- **Blue line:** Hockey Night in Canada average viewership
- **Annotations:** Key events (Canadian team playoffs, McDavid effect, COVID season)

**Data Points:**

| Season | Avg Viewers | YoY Change | Key Event |
|--------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| 2013-14 | 1.8M | Baseline | Pre-Rogers (CBC/TSN) |
| 2014-15 | 1.6M | -11% | Rogers Year 1, weak Canadian teams |
| 2015-16 | 1.5M | -6% | Continued decline |
| 2016-17 | 1.4M | -7% | Cord-cutting accelerates |
| 2017-18 | 1.5M | +7% | Winnipeg Jets deep playoff run |
| 2018-19 | 1.5M | 0% | Stable but below target |
| 2019-20 | 1.4M | -7% | Pre-COVID baseline |
| 2020-21 | 1.2M | -14% | COVID shortened season, bubble playoffs |
| 2021-22 | 1.25M | +4% | Partial recovery |
| 2022-23 | 1.3M | +4% | Connor McDavid Oilers playoff run |
| 2023-24 | 1.3M | 0% | Stable but 28% below 2013 baseline |

**Interactive Features:**
- Click any season to see full details (viewership, Canadian teams in playoffs, major storylines)
- Toggle "Show Canadian Team Playoff Correlation" to highlight seasons when 3+ Canadian teams made playoffs (higher viewership)
- Compare to "Pre-Rogers Baseline" (dotted line at 1.8M)

**Tab 2: Sportsnet NOW Subscribers (Target vs. Actual)**

**Chart Setup:**
- Dual-axis chart (subscribers + revenue)
- **Blue bars:** Actual subscribers (50K → 450K)
- **Red line:** Target subscribers (Rogers' original projections)
- **Green overlay:** Subscription revenue ($M/year)

**Data Points:**

| Year | Target Subs | Actual Subs | Gap | Subscription Revenue | ARPU |
|------|------------|-------------|-----|---------------------|------|
| 2016 (Launch) | 100K | 50K | -50% | $12M | $19.99 |
| 2017 | 250K | 120K | -52% | $29M | $19.99 |
| 2018 | 500K | 200K | -60% | $48M | $19.99 |
| 2019 | 750K | 280K | -63% | $84M | $24.99 |
| 2020 (Year 5) | **1,000K** | **350K** | **-65%** | $105M | $24.99 |
| 2021 | 1,100K | 380K | -65% | $114M | $24.99 |
| 2022 | 1,200K | 420K | -65% | $141M | $27.99 |
| 2023 | 1,300K | 440K | -66% | $148M | $27.99 |
| 2024 | 1,400K | 450K | -68% | $151M | $27.99 |

**Insight Panel (Generated):**
"Sportsnet NOW never achieved critical mass. Year 5 target was 1M subscribers; actual was 350K (65% shortfall). This created a $150M annual revenue gap that Rogers never closed. Lesson: NHL-only content insufficient—fans wanted multi-sport offerings (like DAZN's soccer, boxing, NFL package)."

**Tab 3: Demographic Breakdown (Interactive Filters)**

**Age Distribution (Pie Chart):**
- 18-34: 15% (declining)
- 35-49: 35% (stable)
- 50-64: 38% (stable)
- 65+: 12% (growing)

**Key Insight:** "Younger audiences (18-34) declining as % of total viewership. This age group prefers highlights and social clips (TikTok, Instagram) over full games. Threatens long-term audience sustainability."

**Regional Breakdown (Bar Chart):**
- Ontario: 45% (Toronto, Ottawa markets)
- Alberta: 20% (Calgary, Edmonton markets—Connor McDavid effect)
- Quebec: 18% (Montreal Canadiens)
- BC: 12% (Vancouver Canucks)
- Other: 5%

**Gender Split:**
- Male: 68%
- Female: 32%

**Interactive Filters:**
- "Show only 18-34 age group" → See decline trend over 10 years
- "Compare to TSN demographics" → See TSN's more balanced age distribution (multi-sport strategy)

**Learning Objectives:**
- **MLO 2.4:** Analyze viewership trends and identify market dynamics
- **MLO 2.3:** Understand fan engagement challenges (younger demos not engaging with full games)
- Recognize importance of demographic trends for long-term rights valuation
- Compare target vs. actual performance (gap analysis skill)

#### Element 11: Text - Competitive Landscape (150 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# The Competitive Landscape: TSN, DAZN, and New Entrants

While Rogers struggled with the NHL deal, competitors evolved with diversified strategies.

## TSN (Bell Media): The Diversification Winner
- **Lost:** NHL national rights to Rogers (painful in 2014)
- **Pivoted:** Acquired CFL, NBA, FIFA World Cup, MLS regional, curling, tennis
- **Result:** Multi-sport strategy created stable revenue (no single property = 50% of costs)
- **TSN Direct (streaming):** Launched 2018, reached 400K subscribers by 2024 (vs. Sportsnet NOW 450K)

## DAZN Canada: The Disruptor
- **Launched:** 2017 with soccer (EPL, Champions League, Serie A) + boxing + NFL
- **Strategy:** Lower price ($24.99 vs. Sportsnet $27.99), multi-sport, niche fan targeting
- **Subscribers:** 300K by 2020 (competitive with Sportsnet NOW despite later launch)

## Apple TV+ / Amazon: The Tech Giants
- **Apple:** MLS exclusive deal ($2.5B, 2023-2032) → Global strategy, not ROI-focused
- **Amazon:** NFL Thursday Night Football → Subscription driver for Prime

**Lesson:** Rogers' single-property bet looked increasingly risky as market fragmented and tech giants entered with deep pockets.

**Next: Compare Rogers' strategy to competitors.**
```

**Design Note:** Provides competitive context to show Rogers wasn't just unlucky—market shifted toward multi-sport portfolios while Rogers was locked into NHL-only.

---

#### Element 12: Table - Rogers vs. Competitors Comparison

| **Company** | **Rights Portfolio** | **Annual Rights Costs** | **Streaming Strategy** | **2024 Subscribers** | **Profitability** | **Strategic Approach** |
|------------|---------------------|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Rogers (Sportsnet)** | NHL exclusive | $433M/year | Sportsnet NOW (NHL-only) | 450K | ❌ Unprofitable (10 years) | Single-property bet, defensive strategy |
| **Bell (TSN)** | Multi-sport (CFL, NBA, FIFA, MLS) | $250M/year total | TSN Direct (multi-sport) | 400K | ✅ Profitable Year 3 | Diversification, lower risk |
| **DAZN Canada** | Soccer, boxing, NFL, combat sports | $50M/year | DAZN multi-sport | 300K | ✅ Profitable Year 4 | Niche targeting, global content |
| **Apple TV+** | MLS exclusive (global) | $250M/year | Apple TV+ bundle | 2M+ (MLS Season Pass) | ❌ Strategic investment (not ROI-focused) | Tech giant deep pockets, global strategy |

**Table Caption:** "Canadian Sports Streaming Competitive Landscape (2024)"

**Key Takeaway:**
Rogers' single-property, NHL-exclusive strategy created concentration risk. TSN's multi-sport portfolio and DAZN's niche targeting proved more resilient. Tech giants (Apple, Amazon) can afford "strategic losses" that traditional broadcasters cannot.

**Design Note:** Side-by-side comparison makes Rogers' strategic misstep crystal clear. Multi-sport portfolios spread risk and achieve profitability faster.

#### Element 13: Text - The 2026 Decision (150 words)

Copy the markdown below directly into Uplimit:

```markdown
# 2026: Renew, Renegotiate, or Walk Away?

Rogers' NHL contract expires after the 2025-26 season. The company must decide its next move.

## Three Options on the Table

**Option 1: Renew at Reduced Price**
- NHL knows Rogers overpaid and lost money
- Next deal likely $300-350M/year (30% reduction)
- **Pros:** Keep NHL content, spread costs over longer term (15 years?), flexibility clauses (force majeure)
- **Cons:** Still a massive bet, streaming market even more competitive, younger demos not watching full games

**Option 2: Split Rights Package**
- Rogers takes regional (7 Canadian teams) + streaming
- TSN or Amazon takes national (Saturday nights)
- **Pros:** Lower cost ($200M/year range), shared risk, broader distribution
- **Cons:** Lose exclusivity competitive advantage, coordination challenges

**Option 3: Walk Away Completely**
- Let TSN, DAZN, Apple, or Amazon bid for NHL
- Rogers focuses on other sports or exits sports media
- **Pros:** Cut losses, reallocate capital, focus on wireless/cable core business
- **Cons:** Lose sports brand identity, accelerate cable cord-cutting (NHL was subscriber retention tool)

**Your Task:** What would YOU recommend? Use the decision simulator to explore trade-offs.
```

**Design Note:** Frames the strategic decision as real business problem. Sets up capstone widget where students will make recommendation.

---

#### Element 14: Widget 8 - 2026 Decision Simulator (Capstone Widget)

**Widget Purpose:** Let students make a strategic recommendation for Rogers' 2026 NHL rights decision, weighing financial, competitive, and strategic factors.

**How It Works (Student Experience):**

This is the CAPSTONE widget for Module 5 (and Week 2). Students synthesize ALL Week 2 learning to make a complex business decision.

**Phase 1: Set Your Assumptions**

Students adjust sliders to reflect their market assumptions for 2026-2036 (next 10-year deal):

**Market Assumptions:**
- **Cord-cutting rate:** 3-8%/year (slider) - How fast will cable decline continue?
- **Streaming growth rate:** 5-25%/year (slider) - Can Sportsnet NOW grow faster with lessons learned?
- **NHL viewership trend:** Decline 2%/year, Stable, Grow 2%/year (dropdown) - Connor McDavid effect, younger demos, etc.
- **Competitive intensity:** Low (TSN, DAZN), Medium (+Amazon), High (+Apple, Google) (dropdown)
- **Betting revenue opportunity:** $0, $50M/year, $100M+/year (slider) - Sports betting integration

**Phase 2: Choose Your Option**

**Option 1: Renew Exclusive (Full Package)**
- **Annual Cost:** $300-$350M/year (student sets price via slider)
- **Contract Length:** 10, 12, or 15 years (dropdown)
- **Flexibility Clauses:** Yes (force majeure, performance minimums) or No
- **Revenue Strategy:**
  - Linear TV ad revenue (declining based on cord-cutting assumption)
  - Sportsnet NOW subscriptions (growing based on growth rate assumption)
  - Betting partnerships (if student selected betting opportunity)

**Option 2: Split Package**
- **Rogers Component:** Regional rights (7 Canadian teams) + Streaming
- **Annual Cost:** $200M/year
- **Partner:** National rights go to TSN, Amazon, or Apple (student selects)
- **Revenue Strategy:**
  - Lower rights cost = easier profitability
  - Lose exclusivity = fewer Sportsnet NOW subscribers
  - Broader distribution = better fan accessibility

**Option 3: Walk Away**
- **Annual Cost:** $0 (exit sports media or acquire other properties)
- **Impact on Cable Business:**
  - Cord-cutting accelerates (lose NHL retention tool)
  - Estimated cable subscriber decline increase: +3-5%/year
  - Cable revenue impact: -$500M/year over 10 years
- **Alternative Investments:**
  - Reinvest $300M/year into wireless network expansion (5G)
  - Acquire other sports (MLS, CFL, international soccer)
  - Exit sports media, focus on telecom core business

**Phase 3: View 10-Year Projection**

Based on student's assumptions and chosen option, widget calculates:

**Financial Projection (10-Year):**
- **Annual Revenue:** Year-by-year projection (line chart)
- **Annual Costs:** Rights fees + production + customer acquisition
- **Cumulative Profit/Loss:** Total over 10 years
- **Break-Even Year:** When does Rogers achieve profitability? (or "Never")
- **ROI:** Return on investment (%)

**Strategic Scorecard:**
- **Financial Performance:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5 stars based on profitability)
- **Brand Positioning:** ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (3/5 - exclusive = stronger brand)
- **Risk Management:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5 - flexibility clauses reduce risk)
- **Competitive Defense:** ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (3/5 - keeps NHL away from TSN)
- **Fan Accessibility:** ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (3/5 - subscription barrier remains)

**Phase 4: Compare to Alternatives**

Widget shows side-by-side comparison of student's choice vs. other options:

| Metric | Your Choice (Option 1) | Option 2 (Split) | Option 3 (Walk Away) |
|--------|------------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| 10-Year Profit | +$500M | +$800M | -$2B (cable impact) |
| Break-Even Year | Year 4 | Year 2 | N/A (strategic loss) |
| Brand Strength | Strong (exclusive) | Medium (shared) | Weak (no sports) |
| Risk Level | Medium (with flexibility) | Low (diversified) | High (cable decline) |

**Phase 5: Executive Recommendation**

Student writes brief recommendation (text box, 250 words max):

**Prompt:**
"Based on your analysis, what should Rogers do in 2026? Defend your recommendation with specific financial and strategic reasoning. Address potential risks and how Rogers should mitigate them."

**Export Options:**
- Download full analysis (assumptions + projections + recommendation) as PDF
- Save scenario for comparison (localStorage)
- Share scenario link (URL with parameters)

**Learning Objectives (CAPSTONE - Tests ALL Week 2 MLOs):**
- **MLO 2.1:** Apply rights valuation framework to new deal terms (audience, exclusivity, volume, brand, strategy)
- **MLO 2.2:** Compare platform strategies (exclusive streaming vs. split package vs. exit)
- **MLO 2.3:** Evaluate fan engagement opportunities (betting integration, app features, content strategy)
- **MLO 2.4:** Make comprehensive strategic recommendation weighing financial, competitive, and market factors
- **Bloom's Level:** SYNTHESIS/EVALUATION (highest level - create new solution + justify with evidence)

**Real-World Scenarios (Presets):**

**Scenario A: "Optimistic Renewal"**
- Assumptions: Streaming growth 20%/year, NHL viewership stable, betting revenue $100M/year
- Recommendation: Renew exclusive at $325M/year, 12 years, with flexibility clauses
- Result: Profitable Year 5, cumulative +$1B over 10 years

**Scenario B: "Cautious Split"**
- Assumptions: Cord-cutting 6%/year, streaming growth 10%/year, moderate competition
- Recommendation: Split package (regional + streaming) at $200M/year
- Result: Profitable Year 3, cumulative +$1.2B over 10 years

**Scenario C: "Exit Strategy"**
- Assumptions: Cord-cutting 8%/year, streaming too competitive, tech giants dominate

### Module 5 V3 Summary

**Transformation:**
- **Before:** 10-12 pages case study (25-30 min reading, minimal interactivity)
- **After:** 15 micro-elements (8-10 min reading + 15 min interactive = 23-25 min total)

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ Reduced case text by 70% (4,000 words → 1,200 words core content)
- ✅ Added 4 hands-on widgets (0 → 15 minutes interactive case analysis)
- ✅ Micro-chunked case narrative (no section over 150 words)
- ✅ Progressive disclosure (explore deal terms → analyze performance → make recommendation)
- ✅ Active engagement increased from 5% → 65%
- ✅ Capstone widget integrates ALL Week 2 MLOs (synthesis/evaluation level)

**Student Experience Flow:**
Read case intro (1 min) → Read background (1 min) → **Explore deal terms** (3 min) → Read rationale (1 min) → Watch video (2 min) → Read performance overview (1 min) → **Analyze financial data** (4 min) → See key insight (1 min) → Read audience trends (1 min) → **Explore viewership data** (3 min) → Read competitive landscape (1 min) → Compare to competitors (1 min) → Read 2026 options (1 min) → **Make strategic recommendation** (5 min capstone)

**Pedagogical Benefits:**
- Case analysis scaffolded progressively (context → data → analysis → decision)
- Students manipulate real financial data instead of passively reading exhibits
- Capstone widget requires synthesis of ALL Week 2 concepts (rights valuation, platform economics, engagement, strategic evaluation)
- Multiple valid recommendations possible (no single "right answer" - authentic business decision)
- Export functionality allows students to use analysis in mini-case memo assessment

---

## PEDAGOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS

### Cognitive Load Management

**Before (V1):**
- 16-19 pages continuous text
- Working memory overload (case details forgotten by the time students reach analysis questions)
- Exhibit data buried in accordions (out of sight, out of mind)

**After (V3):**
- No text chunk exceeds 150 words (1 minute reading)
- Mental breaks every 2-3 elements (text → widget → video → widget pattern)
- Exhibit data integrated into interactive widgets (students manipulate data, not just read it)

**Research Support:** Sweller's Cognitive Load Theory (1988) - "Reducing extraneous cognitive load through chunking and visual representations improves learning efficiency"

---

### Active Learning & Discovery

**Before (V1):**
- Students READ ABOUT concepts (passive, declarative knowledge)
- Example: "Media rights are valued based on five factors: audience size, exclusivity, content volume, brand alignment, and platform strategy"

**After (V3):**
- Students MANIPULATE variables and DISCOVER patterns (active, procedural knowledge)
- Example: Widget 1 - Adjust audience size, see valuation change. Adjust exclusivity, see valuation jump 2-3x. **Students discover "exclusivity commands premium" through manipulation, not reading**

**Research Support:** Bonwell & Eison (1991) - "Students must do more than just listen; they must read, write, discuss, or be engaged in solving problems. Active learning involves students in doing things and thinking about what they are doing"

---

### Scaffolding & Progressive Complexity

**Before (V1):**
- Frameworks presented as complete, complex text documents
- Students expected to internalize 5-factor valuation framework from reading alone

**After (V3):**
- **Level 1:** Simple calculator (Widget 1) - Single factor (audience size)
- **Level 2:** Bidding scenario (Widget 2) - Two factors (exclusivity + competition)
- **Level 3:** Multi-variable economics (Widget 3) - Platform trade-offs (5+ variables)
- **Level 4:** Capstone decision (Widget 8) - Synthesis of ALL factors

**Research Support:** Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development - "Scaffolded instruction enables learners to build on existing knowledge through guided exploration"

---

### Authentic Assessment Preparation

**Before (V1):**
- Students read case → Jump to mini-case memo assessment (gap between learning and assessment)
- Widget data not easily exportable for memo writing

**After (V3):**
- Students use SAME TOOLS in learning AND assessment
- Widget 8 (2026 Decision Simulator) generates exportable analysis that can be directly referenced in mini-case memo
- "In my analysis using the 2026 Decision Simulator, I found that..." (authentic application)

**Research Support:** Wiggins & McTighe (2005) - "Backward design: Assessments should mirror learning activities"

---
