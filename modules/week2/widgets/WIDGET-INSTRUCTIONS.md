# Week 2 Widget Instructions (Expandable Boxes)

**Purpose:** Copy these into Details elements after each widget in Uplift storyboards.
**Format:** Each section = one expandable accordion box

---

## Widget 1: Audience Size Calculator

**Details Element Title:** `Need help? How to use this calculator`

```
This calculator helps you understand how audience size and demographics drive media rights valuations.

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Select a league** from the dropdown (NFL, NHL, NBA, MLS, Premier League) or choose "Custom" to enter your own values

2. **Review the pre-filled data** — these are real industry figures for average viewership, game count, and demographic breakdown

3. **Adjust the sliders** to see how changes affect valuation:
   - **Average viewership:** More viewers = higher ad revenue potential
   - **Games per season:** More games = more ad inventory to sell
   - **Coveted demo %:** Higher percentage of 18-49 viewers with $75K+ income = premium ad rates
   - **CPM rate:** Cost per thousand viewers — sports typically command $50-70

4. **Watch the calculation update** in real-time showing total audience reach, demographic premium, and estimated annual rights value

**What to notice:**
- Small changes in coveted demo % have outsized impact on valuation
- The NFL's combination of huge audiences + high demo % explains their $10B/year deals
- MLS has similar game counts to NHL but far lower valuations — why?

**If you're stuck:** Try comparing NFL vs. MLS with identical settings except viewership. What's the multiplier effect?

## Widget 2: Exclusivity Bidding Simulator

**Details Element Title:** `Need help? How to use this simulator`

```
This simulator shows why exclusive rights cost 2-3x more than shared rights — and when that premium is worth paying.

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Set up the auction:**
   - Choose a property (NHL Canadian rights, NFL Sunday package, etc.)
   - Select number of bidders (2-5 competing networks/streamers)
   - Set your budget ceiling

2. **Choose your bid strategy:**
   - **Aggressive:** Bid high early to scare off competitors
   - **Patient:** Wait for others to drop out, then bid
   - **Value-based:** Set a max price based on your ROI model and don't exceed it

3. **Watch the auction unfold** — other bidders respond based on their strategies and budgets

4. **See the outcome:**
   - Did you win? At what price?
   - What's your projected ROI based on the price you paid?
   - How did exclusivity vs. shared rights affect the final price?

**What to notice:**
- Adding just one more bidder can increase final price by 30-50%
- Tech giants (Apple, Amazon) often bid above "rational" ROI because they value subscriber acquisition
- Exclusive rights create winner-take-all dynamics — second place gets nothing

**If you're stuck:** Run the same auction twice — once with 2 bidders, once with 4. Compare final prices.

## Widget 3: Platform Economics Visualizer

**Details Element Title:** `Need help? How to use this visualizer`

```
This visualizer shows why streaming platforms lose money for years while linear TV either profits immediately or fails fast.

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Choose your platform type:**
   - **Linear TV:** Traditional cable/broadcast model
   - **Streaming/DTC:** Direct-to-consumer subscription model

2. **Set your inputs:**
   - **Linear TV:** Rights cost, ad CPM, carriage fees, starting subscribers, annual decline rate
   - **Streaming:** Rights cost, subscription price, starting subs, monthly growth %, churn rate, customer acquisition cost

3. **View the 10-year projection chart:**
   - Blue line = annual revenue
   - Red line = annual costs
   - Green line = break-even threshold
   - Shaded area = profit or loss

4. **Experiment with scenarios:**
   - Try recreating Rogers' NHL deal (linear, high rights cost, declining subscribers)
   - Try DAZN's model (streaming, lower rights cost, high growth + high churn)

**What to notice:**
- Linear TV is profitable Day 1 IF the math works — but cord-cutting can flip it to losses quickly
- Streaming requires 3-5 years to reach profitability even with good execution
- Churn is the streaming killer — 30% annual churn means you're constantly re-acquiring customers

**If you're stuck:** Set both models to identical rights costs ($200M). Which breaks even faster? Why?
```

## Widget 4: Engagement Value Chain Builder

**Details Element Title:** `Need help? How to use this builder`

```
This builder shows how fan engagement creates revenue beyond just watching games.

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Start with a touchpoint:** Select an initial fan interaction (live game viewing, highlight clip, social post, etc.)

2. **Build the engagement chain:** Add downstream touchpoints that flow from the first:
   - Viewing → App download → Fantasy play → Betting → Merchandise purchase
   - Each step has a conversion rate and revenue value

3. **See total fan value:** The widget calculates lifetime value based on your engagement chain

4. **Compare chains:** Try different starting points and see which generates more total value:
   - Does a social media fan become as valuable as a TV viewer?
   - How much does adding betting integration increase fan LTV?

**What to notice:**
- Passive viewers have low LTV — engagement multiplies value
- Betting integration can 3-5x fan value (but not all fans convert)
- The most valuable chains have 4-5 touchpoints, not just 1-2

**If you're stuck:** Build two chains — one for a casual fan (watches some games) and one for a superfan (watches everything, plays fantasy, bets, buys merch). Compare the LTV difference.
```

## Widget 5: Rogers Deal Terms Explorer

**Details Element Title:** `Need help? How to use this explorer`

```
This explorer breaks down exactly what Rogers bought for $5.2 billion — and why exclusivity commanded such a premium.

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Click through the 5 tabs:**
   - **Rights Included:** What content Rogers acquired (1,000+ games/year)
   - **Platforms Covered:** Where they could show games (TV, streaming, digital, radio)
   - **Exclusivity Terms:** What competitors lost (TSN locked out entirely)
   - **Revenue Projections:** What Rogers expected to earn (break-even by Year 5)
   - **Comparison:** How this deal compared to the previous CBC/TSN arrangement

2. **Note the key numbers:**
   - $433M annual cost vs. previous $140M/year (3x increase)
   - 1M Sportsnet NOW subscribers projected by Year 5
   - 12-year term with no exit clauses

3. **Export your summary** to reference when writing your memo

**What to notice:**
- Rogers didn't just buy games — they bought complete platform control
- The exclusivity premium was 209% over the previous shared deal
- Revenue projections assumed streaming adoption that never materialized

**If you're stuck:** Focus on Tab 4 (Revenue Projections) and Tab 5 (Comparison). What assumptions would need to be true for Rogers to break even?
```

## Widget 6: Projections vs. Actuals Visualizer

**Details Element Title:** `Need help? How to use this visualizer`

```
This visualizer shows exactly where Rogers' projections went wrong — and by how much.

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Understand the three lines:**
   - **Blue line:** Rogers' original revenue projections (what they expected)
   - **Red line:** Actual revenue achieved (what really happened)
   - **Green horizontal line:** Break-even threshold ($433M/year)

2. **Scrub through the timeline:** Use the slider to move through Years 1-10

3. **Hover over any year** to see detailed breakdown:
   - Projected vs. actual revenue
   - Variance amount and percentage
   - Key event that year (COVID, cord-cutting acceleration, etc.)

4. **Look for patterns:**
   - When did the gap start? (Hint: Year 1)
   - Did it narrow or widen over time?
   - What was the single worst year? Why?

**What to notice:**
- Rogers NEVER crossed the green break-even line in 10 years
- The gap widened every year until Year 7 (COVID) when it collapsed entirely
- Even without COVID, the trajectory was headed for ~$1B cumulative losses

**If you're stuck:** Look at Year 5 (supposed break-even year). What was the variance? What does that tell you about the original assumptions?
```

## Widget 7: Viewership Trends Analyzer

**Details Element Title:** `Need help? How to use this analyzer`

```
This analyzer explores the audience trends behind Rogers' financial performance.

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Explore the 3 tabs:**
   - **Tab 1: Linear TV Ratings** — Hockey Night in Canada viewership 2014-2024
   - **Tab 2: Sportsnet NOW Subscribers** — Streaming growth vs. targets
   - **Tab 3: Demographic Breakdown** — Who's watching (age, gender, region)

2. **Use the filters:**
   - Select specific years to compare
   - Toggle between absolute numbers and % change
   - Hover for detailed data points

3. **Look for the story:**
   - Linear TV: Steady decline or sudden drops?
   - Streaming: Growth trajectory — accelerating or stalling?
   - Demographics: Which groups are growing vs. shrinking?

**What to notice:**
- Hockey Night in Canada lost 28% of its audience over 10 years
- 18-34 viewers declined 48% while 55+ held steady — aging audience crisis
- Sportsnet NOW peaked at 450K vs. 1M target — hockey alone wasn't enough

**If you're stuck:** Compare Tab 3's demographic data to Rogers' original assumptions. They projected streaming would attract younger viewers. Did it?
```

## Widget 8: 2026 Decision Simulator (CAPSTONE)

**Details Element Title:** `Need help? How to use this simulator`

```
This is your Week 2 capstone — synthesize everything you've learned to make a strategic recommendation.

**Step-by-step:**

**Phase 1: Set Your Assumptions**
- Adjust sliders for cord-cutting rate, streaming growth, viewership trends, competitive intensity, and betting revenue potential
- These assumptions drive your 10-year projections — be thoughtful about what you believe will happen

**Phase 2: Choose Your Option**
- **Option 1: Renew Exclusive** ($300-350M/year) — Keep full control, highest risk/reward
- **Option 2: Split Package** ($200M/year) — Share with partner, lower risk/reward
- **Option 3: Walk Away** — Exit NHL, redeploy capital elsewhere

**Phase 3: View Projections**
- See 10-year revenue, costs, and cumulative profit/loss for your choice
- Note the break-even year (or if it never reaches break-even)
- Review the strategic scorecard (5 criteria rated)

**Phase 4: Compare Alternatives**
- Side-by-side comparison of all 3 options under YOUR assumptions
- See which performs best financially and strategically

**Phase 5: Write Your Recommendation**
- 250-word executive summary justifying your choice
- Export full analysis as PDF for your memo

**What to notice:**
- Your assumptions dramatically change which option looks best
- There's no single "right answer" — it depends on risk tolerance and strategic priorities
- The best recommendations acknowledge trade-offs and counterarguments

**If you're stuck:** Start with "base case" assumptions (middle of each slider), see which option wins, then stress-test by moving assumptions to pessimistic and optimistic extremes.
