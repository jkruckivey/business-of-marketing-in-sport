SELECTION RATIONALE
-------------------
Word Count: 247

Halifax represents the strongest CFL expansion opportunity due to its unique combination of market exclusivity, regional identity, and untapped corporate potential. As Atlantic Canada's largest city with a metro population of 480,000, Halifax offers the CFL something no other expansion market can: complete professional sports monopoly in a region of over 2.5 million people across the Maritime provinces.

The market's low competition level is particularly compelling. Unlike London (competing with Toronto sports) or Victoria (competing with Vancouver), Halifax has no major professional sports franchise. This creates an opportunity to become "Atlantic Canada's Team" and capture fans across Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and PEI. The strong university football culture at SMU, Saint Mary's, and Dalhousie provides a foundation of football-literate fans who understand and appreciate the Canadian game.

The corporate sponsorship base, while smaller than central Canadian markets, includes regional headquarters for major banks, insurance companies, and energy sector firms eager for premium sports marketing opportunities currently unavailable in the region.

The primary challenge will be stadium financing. Halifax requires a new build in the 15,000-20,000 seat range, which will require creative public-private partnership structures. Additionally, building a competitive roster while managing travel costs for the league's easternmost franchise will require careful negotiation with the CFL on scheduling and revenue sharing. These challenges are addressable and will be detailed in subsequent milestones.
