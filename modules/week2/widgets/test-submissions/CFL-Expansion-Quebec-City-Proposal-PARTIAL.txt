SELECTION RATIONALE
-------------------
Word Count: 142

I chose Quebec City because it's a great market for CFL expansion. The city has a large population and there's already interest in football because of the Laval Rouge et Or university team. French-Canadian fans are very passionate about sports and would support a CFL team.

Quebec City doesn't have an NHL team anymore so fans there are looking for a major professional sports franchise. The CFL could fill that gap. The city is also the capital of Quebec which means there's lots of business activity.

I think the main challenge would be building a new stadium but that's something every expansion team has to deal with. Overall Quebec City would be a good choice for CFL expansion because of the passionate fans and growing population.
