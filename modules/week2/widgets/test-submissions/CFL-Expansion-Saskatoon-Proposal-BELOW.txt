SELECTION RATIONALE
-------------------
Word Count: 103

Saskatoon seems like a good city for a new CFL team. Saskatchewan loves football and having two teams could be cool like how Alberta has Calgary and Edmonton. The city has been growing and there are lots of fans there.

I picked this city because I think it would work. Football is popular in Saskatchewan so people would probably come to games. The Roughriders are popular but maybe Saskatoon wants their own team too.

It might be hard to compete with the Roughriders but I think it could work out if the league supported it.
