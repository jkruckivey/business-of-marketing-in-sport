### Video Script: "The $500 Million Question" (SME Direct-to-Camera)

**Recording Setup:** SME on camera, professional background, teleprompter optional

```
[0:00-0:20] INTRODUCTION & CREDIBILITY

SME: "Hi, I'm [NAME], and I've spent [X] years on the brand side of sports marketing—
negotiating sponsorships, building activations, and trying to justify why we pay
millions of dollars to put our logo on a jersey.

And I want to start Week 3 with a question that haunts every CMO I know."

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "The $500 Million Question"]


[0:20-1:10] THE PARADOX SETUP

SME: "Major brands like Nike spend hundreds of millions annually on sports sponsorships worldwide.
Every league, every athlete, every major property you can think of.

[VISUAL CUE: Show montage of Nike-sponsored properties]

Your CFO looks at this budget and asks the obvious question:
'What are we getting for all these sponsorship dollars?'

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Billions spent on sponsorship"]

So you show them the metrics:
• 15 billion social media impressions
• 3.2 billion TV viewers reached
• 500 million jersey sales (swoosh visibility)

[Pause, lean forward]

And your CFO says: 'That's nice. But did we SELL more shoes?'

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "But did it drive sales?"]


[1:10-1:50] REFRAMING THE PROBLEM

SME: "Here's the uncomfortable truth: Most brands can't definitively prove sponsorship ROI.

Nike BELIEVES their sports partnerships drive billions in sales. They have mountains
of correlation data. But causation? That's where it gets messy.

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Correlation ≠ Causation"]

Because here's what makes sports sponsorship different from digital advertising:

Digital ad: You click, you buy, we track it. ROI = crystal clear.

Sports sponsorship: You see the swoosh on LeBron's jersey during Game 7. Three months
later, you buy new running shoes. Was that BECAUSE of the sponsorship? Or would you
have bought them anyway?

This isn't unique to Nike. It's THE challenge facing every brand spending billions
on sports partnerships.


[1:50-2:30] THE CHALLENGE

SME: "This week, you're going to learn how brands ACTUALLY measure sponsorship value—
even when perfect attribution is impossible. You'll understand why sports betting
has become the fastest-growing sponsorship category (hint: it's the ONLY category
with perfect attribution). And you'll build a 1-page activation plan with ROI
projections that could actually get approved by a skeptical CFO.

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "How do you prove $500M is working?"]

But here's the meta-lesson: The brands that win in sports marketing aren't the ones
with perfect data. They're the ones who build FRAMEWORKS that quantify value even
when data is messy.

That's what you'll learn this week. But first, I need to know: Can you calculate
sponsorship ROI RIGHT NOW—with imperfect data?

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Can you calculate ROI with messy data?"]

The next exercise is a diagnostic conversation. It'll reveal whether you understand
how brands justify multi-million dollar sports partnerships. Not graded—just revealing.

Ready? Let's see what you know about sponsorship economics."

## Element 2: AI Roleplay - Sponsorship ROI Diagnostic

**Widget Type:** AI Roleplay (Uplimit built-in element)
**Purpose:** Diagnostic conversation revealing knowledge gaps about sponsorship ROI calculation (formative, not graded)
**Estimated Time:** 5-7 minutes
**Learning Outcome Supported:** Prepares for WLO 3.3 (calculate sponsorship ROI) and WLO 3.4 (design activations)

### Student-Facing Instructions (Place as Text element BEFORE AI Roleplay)

```markdown
### Your Role
You are a **sponsorship consultant** hired by a major consumer brand. The CMO (AI) needs to justify $50M in annual sports sponsorships to their skeptical CFO.

### Getting Started
**You need to start the conversation.** When the chat opens, begin by explaining (in simple terms) how you think brands should measure sponsorship ROI when direct "click-to-purchase" attribution isn't available.

### Your Goal
⚠️ **This is diagnostic—you're not expected to ace this!** Most students struggle before learning Week 3 content. The goal is to discover gaps in your understanding so you know what to focus on this week.

### Conversation Length
3-4 exchanges with the CMO. If you get stuck, that's the point—those are your learning priorities.
```

### UPLIFT CONFIGURATION

**Tab 1: Learning Outcome**

**Widget Name:** Sponsorship ROI Diagnostic

**Learning Outcome:**
```
Students will articulate their current understanding of how brands calculate sponsorship ROI with imperfect attribution data, revealing knowledge gaps before learning Week 3 frameworks. This diagnostic conversation helps students identify three key areas:

1. CPM calculation knowledge (can they convert impressions to dollar values?)
2. Attribution challenges (do they understand why sponsorship ROI differs from digital advertising?)
3. Activation multipliers (are they aware of the 2-3× activation spend rule?)

Success = Student finishes knowing exactly what they DON'T know yet, with motivation to learn Week 3 content.
```

**Scenario Setup:** Diagnostic (pre-learning assessment)

---

**Tab 2: Scenario**

**Context:**
```
A major consumer brand (apparel, beverage, or automotive) spends $50 million per year on sports sponsorships. The CFO is skeptical and demands ROI proof before approving next year's budget. The brand's CMO has hired a sponsorship consultant to build a framework for measuring sponsorship value when direct "click-to-purchase" attribution isn't possible. The learner will engage in a diagnostic conversation with the CMO who asks probing Socratic questions to help reveal the learner's current understanding of sponsorship ROI while gently exposing gaps in their knowledge. This formative exercise helps the learner identify what they need to focus on during Week 3.
```

**Role of AI (CMO):**
```
The AI plays the CMO of a major consumer brand who needs to justify $50M in sports sponsorships to a skeptical CFO and is seeking the consultant's help to build a measurement framework.
```

**Role of Student:**
```
The learner plays the role of a sponsorship consultant advising the CMO on how to calculate ROI when direct attribution is challenging.
```

---

**Tab 3: Hidden Context**

```
**AI Character Context:**
You are a CMO conducting a diagnostic conversation. The student is encountering sponsorship ROI frameworks for the first time. Most will struggle—this is intentional and pedagogically valuable.

**What Students Typically Miss (use to guide probing):**
- CPM calculation (Cost Per Mille = rights fee / impressions × 1,000)
- The 2-3× activation rule (for every $1 in rights, spend $2-3 on activation)
- Attribution differences (sponsorship vs. digital advertising)
- Betting sponsor advantages (closed-loop attribution, first-party data)
- Brand value vs. sales conversion (awareness ≠ revenue)

**AI Personality Traits:**
- Professional but empathetic: You acknowledge ROI is genuinely hard to measure
- Socratic: When they struggle, you ask questions that help them discover gaps rather than lecturing
- Patient: This is diagnostic, so you don't expect perfection
- Business-focused: You care about clear explanations backed by strategic reasoning

**Conversation Strategy:**

Wait for the student to start the conversation. They've been asked to explain how to measure sponsorship ROI. Listen to their opening explanation, then respond with probing questions based on what they say:

1. If they mention only impressions/awareness, ask: "We get 500 million impressions from our jersey sponsor. What's that worth in dollars? What's the formula?"

2. If they struggle with CPM, ask: "How is sponsorship ROI different from digital advertising ROI where we can track clicks to purchases?"

3. If they don't mention activation, ask: "So if we pay $5M for a sponsorship, is that our total investment? What else should we budget for?"

4. If they mention betting sponsors, ask: "You mentioned betting sponsors have better data. What's 'closed-loop attribution' and why can't traditional sponsors do that?"

5. Closing (after 3-4 exchanges): Acknowledge their effort and gaps: "You've got some intuitions about brand value, but there are industry frameworks—like CPM, engagement multipliers, and conversion attribution—that would sharpen your thinking. That's exactly what you'll learn this week."

Exit gracefully after 3-4 exchanges even if they're still struggling—the goal is diagnosis, not mastery.

**Success Indicators:**
- ✅ Student attempts answer (even if incomplete)
- ✅ Student recognizes their knowledge gaps
- ✅ Student feels motivated to learn, not defeated
```

---

**Tab 4: Criteria**

**Grading:** Not graded (formative diagnostic - completion credit only)

No evaluation criteria. Students receive completion credit for engaging with the AI roleplay. This diagnostic is designed to reveal knowledge gaps before learning begins, not to assess mastery.

## Element 3: Infobox - The Sponsorship Problem Statement

**Type:** Infobox (Callout variant)
**Icon:** ⚠️ or 💡
**Priority:** ⬤ Required

```
Title: ⚠️ The Sponsorship ROI Challenge

Major brands like Nike spend hundreds of millions annually on sports sponsorships worldwide. They can track
billions of impressions and millions of jersey sales. But when their CFO asks,
"Did this drive shoe sales?"—the answer gets complicated.

**The Strategic Challenge:**

Unlike digital advertising (click → purchase → perfect attribution), sports sponsorship
value is distributed across awareness, consideration, purchase intent, and long-term
brand equity. You see LeBron's Nike jersey in June. You buy new shoes in September.
Was that BECAUSE of the sponsorship? Or correlation without causation?

**This Week's Question:**

How do you calculate ROI for sports partnerships when perfect attribution is impossible—
but billion-dollar budgets require justification?

You'll learn the frameworks brands use to quantify sponsorship value: CPM analysis,
engagement multipliers, conversion attribution, and closed-loop measurement (the sports
betting innovation). You'll build activation plans with ROI projections that CFOs
actually approve.

**But first**: The diagnostic exercises below reveal what you understand NOW about
sponsorship ROI—before you learn Week 3's frameworks. This helps you identify exactly
where to focus your learning energy this week.

## Element 4: Pre-Assessment Widget (iFrame)

**Widget Name:** Sponsorship ROI Pre-Assessment
**File:** `sponsorship-roi-pre-assessment.html`
**Type:** iFrame Widget
**Purpose:** Combined challenge preview + quiz assessing baseline sponsorship knowledge
**Estimated Time:** 5-7 minutes
**Learning Outcome:** Diagnostic assessment for WLOs 3.1-3.4

### Widget Structure

**Section 1: Challenge Preview (Non-Interactive Text)**

Display this text at the top of the widget:

```markdown
## Week 3 Challenge: Design a Sponsorship Activation Plan

By Friday, you'll be able to:

**Analyze** why sponsorship is sport's financial backbone (generates more than ticketing for most leagues)

**Calculate** sponsorship ROI using industry frameworks (CPM, engagement multipliers, conversion attribution)

**Evaluate** sports betting as a growth driver (fastest-growing sponsorship category with closed-loop attribution)

**Design** a 2-page strategy memo with ROI projections for a real sponsorship decision (your individual deliverable)

This challenge requires understanding:
- How brands measure sponsorship value (reach × engagement × conversion)
- Why attribution is hard (you see jersey sponsorship in June, buy shoes in September)
- How betting sponsorships differ (closed-loop attribution = every bet tracked)
- What activations actually deliver ROI (turnkey packages across 5 channels)

**Before you learn these frameworks, let's see what you already know...**
```
