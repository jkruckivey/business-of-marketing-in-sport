```
[0:00-0:20] INTRODUCTION & CREDIBILITY

SME: "Hi, I'm [NAME], and I've spent [X] years on the brand side of sports marketing—
negotiating sponsorships, building activations, and trying to justify why we pay
millions of dollars to put our logo on a jersey.

And I want to start Week 3 with a question that haunts every CMO I know."

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "The $500 Million Question"]


[0:20-1:10] THE PARADOX SETUP

SME: "Nike pays over $500 million per year in sports sponsorships. Worldwide.
Every league, every athlete, every major property you can think of.

[VISUAL CUE: Show montage of Nike-sponsored properties]

Your CFO looks at this budget and asks the obvious question:
'What are we getting for half a billion dollars?'

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "$500M+/year in sponsorships"]

So you show them the metrics:
• 15 billion social media impressions
• 3.2 billion TV viewers reached
• 500 million jersey sales (swoosh visibility)

[Pause, lean forward]

And your CFO says: 'That's nice. But did we SELL more shoes?'

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "But did it drive sales?"]


[1:10-1:50] REFRAMING THE PROBLEM

SME: "Here's the uncomfortable truth: Most brands can't definitively prove sponsorship ROI.

Nike BELIEVES their sports partnerships drive billions in sales. They have mountains
of correlation data. But causation? That's where it gets messy.

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Correlation ≠ Causation"]

Because here's what makes sports sponsorship different from digital advertising:

Digital ad: You click, you buy, we track it. ROI = crystal clear.

Sports sponsorship: You see the swoosh on LeBron's jersey during Game 7. Three months
later, you buy new running shoes. Was that BECAUSE of the sponsorship? Or would you
have bought them anyway?

This isn't unique to Nike. It's THE challenge facing every brand spending billions
on sports partnerships.


[1:50-2:30] THE CHALLENGE

SME: "This week, you're going to learn how brands ACTUALLY measure sponsorship value—
even when perfect attribution is impossible. You'll understand why sports betting
has become the fastest-growing sponsorship category (hint: it's the ONLY category
with perfect attribution). And you'll build a 1-page activation plan with ROI
projections that could actually get approved by a skeptical CFO.

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "How do you prove $500M is working?"]

But here's the meta-lesson: The brands that win in sports marketing aren't the ones
with perfect data. They're the ones who build FRAMEWORKS that quantify value even
when data is messy.

That's what you'll learn this week. But first, I need to know: Can you calculate
sponsorship ROI RIGHT NOW—with imperfect data?

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Can you calculate ROI with messy data?"]

The next exercise is a diagnostic conversation. It'll reveal whether you understand
how brands justify multi-million dollar sports partnerships. Not graded—just revealing.

Ready? Let's see what you know about sponsorship economics."

## Element 2: AI Roleplay - Sponsorship ROI Diagnostic

**Widget Type:** AI Roleplay (Uplimit built-in element)
**Purpose:** Diagnostic conversation revealing knowledge gaps about sponsorship ROI calculation (formative, not graded)
**Estimated Time:** 5-7 minutes
**Learning Outcome Supported:** Prepares for MLO 3.3 (calculate sponsorship ROI) and MLO 3.4 (design activations)

### UPLIMIT CONFIGURATION

**Tab 1: Learning Objective**

**Name:** Sponsorship ROI Diagnostic

**Learning Objective:**
Students will articulate their current understanding of how brands calculate sponsorship ROI with imperfect attribution data, revealing knowledge gaps before learning Week 3 frameworks. This diagnostic conversation (formative, not graded) helps students identify what they need to focus on during the week.

**Scenario Setup:**
You are a **sponsorship consultant** hired by a major consumer brand. Your client (the AI) is the CMO who needs to justify their $50M annual sports sponsorship budget to the CFO. They ask you to explain how to calculate ROI when direct attribution is difficult.

---

**Tab 2: Scenario**

Copy this into the **Scenario** field:

```
You are the CMO of a major consumer brand (apparel, beverage, or automotive—your choice) spending $50 million per year on sports sponsorships. Your CFO is skeptical and demands ROI proof before approving next year's budget.

You've hired a sponsorship consultant (the student) to help you build a framework for measuring sponsorship value. You need to understand HOW to calculate ROI when direct "click-to-purchase" attribution isn't possible.

Your role is to ask probing Socratic questions that help the student reveal their current understanding of sponsorship ROI—while gently exposing gaps in their knowledge.

**Conversation Flow:**

1. **Opening**: Thank the student for joining and explain the challenge: "Our CFO wants proof that $50M in sponsorships drives sales. How should we measure ROI when we can't track every customer from logo exposure to purchase?"

2. **Follow-up questions** (adapt based on student responses):
   - "You mentioned [X metric]. How do I turn that into dollars? What's the formula?"
   - "We get 500 million impressions from our jersey sponsor. What's that worth?"
   - "How is sponsorship ROI different from digital advertising ROI?"
   - "Sports betting sponsors claim 'closed-loop attribution.' What does that mean?"
   - "If I can't prove causation, how do I justify the spend?"

3. **Gentle challenges** (when student gives incomplete or incorrect answers):
   - "That's a good start, but Nike spends $500M+/year and still struggles to prove direct causation. What frameworks do they use?"
   - "You mentioned awareness, but the CFO wants to see revenue impact. How do we connect those dots?"

4. **Closing** (after 3-4 exchanges):
   - Acknowledge what the student got right
   - Point out 1-2 specific areas where their understanding is incomplete
   - Say: "You've got some intuitions about brand value, but there are industry frameworks—like CPM, engagement multipliers, and conversion attribution—that would sharpen your thinking. That's exactly what you'll learn this week. Ready to build ROI models that CFOs actually approve?"

**Tone:** Professional, empathetic (acknowledges ROI is genuinely hard to measure), Socratic

**Goal:** Help students discover WHERE their ROI knowledge gaps are so they know what to focus on during Week 3.
```

**Tab 3: Instructions for Students**

Copy this into the **Instructions for Students** field:

```markdown
### Your Role
You are a **sponsorship consultant** hired by a major consumer brand. The CMO (AI) needs to justify $50M in annual sports sponsorships to their skeptical CFO.

### Getting Started
**You need to start the conversation.** When the chat opens, begin by explaining (in simple terms) how you think brands should measure sponsorship ROI when direct "click-to-purchase" attribution isn't available.

### The Scenario
The CMO's CFO wants proof that sponsorships drive sales, not just awareness. The CMO needs frameworks to quantify value with imperfect data. They're going to ask you probing questions about your measurement approach.

### What to Have Ready
- **Your current understanding** of how brands measure sponsorship value (it's okay if this is limited!)
- **Your best attempt** at explaining ROI calculation with messy attribution
- **Curiosity** about what you DON'T know yet

### Your Goal
⚠️ **This is diagnostic—you're not expected to ace this!** Most students struggle before learning Week 3 content. The goal is to:

1. Start the conversation with your best attempt at explaining sponsorship ROI calculation
2. Respond to the CMO's probing questions using your current knowledge
3. Discover gaps in your understanding (this is GOOD—it shows you what to focus on)
4. Get motivated to learn the ROI frameworks that would help you answer confidently

### Conversation Length
- **3-4 exchanges** with the CMO
- The AI will probe your understanding with 2-3 follow-up questions after your opening explanation
- If you get stuck, that's the point! Notice where you struggle—those are your learning priorities.

### What Happens Next
After this exercise, you'll take a pre-assessment quiz that helps you identify exactly what you need to learn. By the end of Week 3, you'll design a complete activation plan with ROI projections that CFOs would actually approve.
```

---

**Tab 4: Grading Rubric**

**Grading:** Not graded (formative diagnostic only)

**Why Not Graded:**
This is a formative assessment designed to reveal knowledge gaps BEFORE learning begins. Students should feel safe exploring and making mistakes. Grading would create anxiety and discourage honest engagement.

**Completion Credit:**
Students receive completion credit for engaging with the AI roleplay (tracked by Uplimit automatically). Actual understanding is measured by the Week 3 Group Sprint Assessment (activation plan with ROI projections).

**Icon:** ⚠️ or 💡
**Priority:** ⬤ Required

```
Title: ⚠️ The $500 Million ROI Challenge

Nike pays over $500 million per year in sports sponsorships worldwide. They can track
billions of impressions and millions of jersey sales. But when their CFO asks,
"Did this drive shoe sales?"—the answer gets complicated.

**The Strategic Challenge:**

Unlike digital advertising (click → purchase → perfect attribution), sports sponsorship
value is distributed across awareness, consideration, purchase intent, and long-term
brand equity. You see LeBron's Nike jersey in June. You buy new shoes in September.
Was that BECAUSE of the sponsorship? Or correlation without causation?

**This Week's Question:**

How do you calculate ROI for sports partnerships when perfect attribution is impossible—
but billion-dollar budgets require justification?

You'll learn the frameworks brands use to quantify sponsorship value: CPM analysis,
engagement multipliers, conversion attribution, and closed-loop measurement (the sports
betting innovation). You'll build activation plans with ROI projections that CFOs
actually approve.

**But first**: The diagnostic exercises below reveal what you understand NOW about
sponsorship ROI—before you learn Week 3's frameworks. This helps you identify exactly
where to focus your learning energy this week.

## Element 4: Pre-Assessment Widget (iFrame)

**Widget Name:** Sponsorship ROI Pre-Assessment
**File:** `sponsorship-roi-pre-assessment.html`
**Type:** iFrame Widget
**Purpose:** Combined challenge preview + quiz assessing baseline sponsorship knowledge
**Estimated Time:** 5-7 minutes
**Learning Outcome:** Diagnostic assessment for MLOs 3.1-3.4

### Widget Structure

**Section 1: Challenge Preview (Non-Interactive Text)**

Display this text at the top of the widget:

```markdown
## Week 3 Challenge: Design a Sponsorship Activation Plan

By Friday, you'll be able to:

**Analyze** why sponsorship is sport's financial backbone (generates more than ticketing for most leagues)

**Calculate** sponsorship ROI using industry frameworks (CPM, engagement multipliers, conversion attribution)

**Evaluate** sports betting as a growth driver (fastest-growing sponsorship category with closed-loop attribution)

**Design** a 1-page activation plan with ROI projections for a real brand/property partnership (your group sprint deliverable)

This challenge requires understanding:
- How brands measure sponsorship value (reach × engagement × conversion)
- Why attribution is hard (you see jersey sponsorship in June, buy shoes in September)
- How betting sponsorships differ (closed-loop attribution = every bet tracked)
- What activations actually deliver ROI (turnkey packages across 5 channels)

**Before you learn these frameworks, let's see what you already know...**
```

**Section 2: Pre-Assessment Quiz (12 Questions)**

Format: Multiple choice + short answer

**Question 1 (MC):**
Nike pays $500M+/year in sports sponsorships. Why can't they easily prove ROI?

a) They don't track impressions

- $25M in attributed sales

If they paid $10M for the sponsorship, what's the ROI?
a) 50% ($5M profit / $10M cost)
b) 150% ($15M profit / $10M cost) ✓
c) 250% ($25M revenue / $10M cost)
d) ROI cannot be calculated

**Question 12 (SA - 2-3 sentences):**
Based on what you know right now, what's ONE thing you would include in a sponsorship activation plan to help prove ROI to a skeptical CFO?

## 🎯 FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION

**How Module 0 Supports Your Final Strategic Vision:**

Module 0 introduced the challenge of proving sponsorship ROI—a problem every sports property and brand partner faces (Nike's $500M question). This challenge is central to your Week 5 capstone since sponsorship represents 15-25% of most sports properties' revenue.

**What You Discovered:**
- Sponsorship ROI is inherently difficult to prove—attribution gaps between logo exposure and purchase decisions
- Billion-dollar budgets require justification, even when perfect attribution is impossible
- Sports betting sponsorships offer unique advantage: closed-loop attribution (fan sees ad → places bet → sponsor tracks conversion immediately)

**How to Apply This to Your Final Project:**

When you create your 5-year strategic vision in Week 5, Module 0's ROI challenge shapes your sponsorship section:

- **Sponsorship Value Proposition:** Your capstone must explain to potential sponsors WHY your property is worth investing in. Use Week 3 frameworks to quantify value: "Our property delivers 50M annual impressions, 5% engagement rate, targeting 18-49 demographics. Using Week 3 CPM benchmarks, we offer $X value for $Y investment."

- **Activation Infrastructure:** Nike's challenge teaches that logo placement alone doesn't prove ROI. Your vision should include activation capabilities: "We offer turnkey activation across 5 channels (broadcast integrations, digital content, experiential, retail, measurement) enabling sponsors to track reach → engagement → conversion."

- **Betting Integration:** If your property operates in betting-legal markets (38 US states, Canada, UK, Australia), explain betting partnership opportunity. Example: "Betting sponsors pay 20-30% premiums vs. traditional categories due to closed-loop attribution. Our property can offer 'Official Betting Partner' status with in-game integrations and exclusive promotions."

**Real-World Application:** Your Week 5 capstone must answer: "Why should brands invest in OUR property vs. competitors?" Module 0 taught you that answering requires frameworks that quantify value even when data is messy—that's exactly what Week 3 teaches.

---

## Module Summary

**What You've Accomplished:**
You've been hooked by a real sponsorship challenge—Nike's $500M+ annual spend that's hard to definitively justify to skeptical CFOs—and you've taken your first steps toward solving it. Through the diagnostic conversation and pre-assessment quiz, you've discovered exactly where your ROI calculation knowledge stands. That clarity isn't a weakness—it's your competitive advantage for this week.

**Key Insight:**
The fact that you struggled with ROI calculation in the diagnostic is expected. Sponsorship measurement is MORE COMPLEX than digital advertising because attribution is distributed across time (see jersey sponsor in June, buy shoes in September) and multiple touchpoints (TV exposure + social media + retail activation). Even sophisticated brands like Nike struggle with this. Week 3 teaches you the frameworks that quantify value despite imperfect data—and shows why sports betting has become the fastest-growing category (closed-loop attribution solves the measurement problem).

**Up Next: Module 1 - Learning Outcomes**
Now that you've seen the problem and identified your knowledge gaps, Module 1 will show you exactly what you're going to learn this week—and how Week 3's frameworks build on Weeks 1-2. You'll see the four key challenges you'll be able to solve by Friday, transforming you from someone who sees sponsorship as "logos on jerseys" into someone who can build activation plans with ROI projections that CFOs actually approve.

Ready to turn those knowledge gaps into financial modeling capabilities? Let's define your learning path.
