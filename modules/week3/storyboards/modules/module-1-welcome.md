## Element 1: Week 2‚Üí3 Transition Text

**Copy this markdown directly into Uplimit:**

```markdown
You've explored how media rights are valued, compared linear TV vs. streaming economics, and analyzed Rogers' $5.2B NHL deal. You understand how platforms monetize sports content through subscriptions, ads, and engagement.

But media rights are only one revenue stream. This week, we shift focus to two growth engines transforming sports business: **sponsorship** (the financial backbone that funds leagues, teams, and athletes) and **sports betting** (the fastest-growing revenue opportunity in North American sports).

These aren't independent topics‚Äîthey're deeply interconnected. Sports betting partnerships are becoming the most valuable sponsorship category, brands activate through betting platforms, and fan engagement drives both sponsorship value and betting revenue. By the end of this week, you'll design a sponsorship activation plan that integrates both dimensions and calculates measurable ROI.
```

**Video Script (2 minutes):**
```
[0:00-0:15] Introduction
"I'm Andrew Sneyd from FanDuel. In 2018, the Supreme Court repealed PASPA, legalizing sports betting across the US. What happened next transformed the industry."

[0:15-0:45] Growth Statistics
"FanDuel went from zero to over $50 billion in annual handle by 2024. Sports betting partnerships now represent 10-15% of total league sponsorship revenue‚Äîand it's the fastest-growing category. Teams that couldn't monetize betting in 2017 now have $10-50 million annual deals with operators like us."

[0:45-1:15] Fan Engagement Impact
"But betting isn't just about operator revenue. It drives fan behavior: bettors watch 35-50% more games (varies by sport), engage with team apps 3x more frequently, and spend 2x on merchandise. That's why media rights holders pay premiums for betting-legal markets‚Äîmore engaged viewers mean higher ad rates."

[1:15-1:45] Sponsorship Intersection
"Our partnerships aren't traditional logo placements. We integrate into broadcasts (betting odds segments), mobile apps (same-game parlays), and in-stadium experiences (betting kiosks). Brands want the engagement we deliver, which is why FanDuel, DraftKings, and BetMGM now rank among the top 10 sports sponsors."

[1:45-2:00] Conclusion
"This week, you'll analyze FanDuel's case and design a sponsorship activation. Think about how betting changes the value equation for brands, properties, and fans."
```

## Element 4: Executive Video 2 - Brand Sponsor Leader

**Video Specifications:**
- **Length:** 2 minutes
- **Speaker:** Brand Sponsor Leader (corporate CMO or sponsorship VP)
- **Topic:** "How Brands Measure ROI in Sports Partnerships"
- **Key Points:** Sponsorship decision framework, activation vs. rights fees, measurable outcomes, betting integration
- **Accessibility:** Captions required, transcript provided

**Video Status:** üìù Script complete, awaiting production and executive scheduling

  title="Brand Sponsor - Sports Partnership ROI Framework"
  aria-label="Video interview with brand sponsorship executive explaining ROI framework and activation budget strategies"
  allowfullscreen
  loading="lazy">
</iframe>
```

**Video Script (2 minutes):**
```
[0:00-0:15] Introduction
"I lead sports sponsorship for [Brand]. We spend $XX million annually on partnerships. Here's how we decide where to invest‚Äîand how we measure success."

[0:15-0:45] Rights Fees vs. Activation
"A common mistake: thinking the rights fee is the investment. Wrong. For every $1 in rights fees, brands spend $2-3 on activation. If we pay $5 million to sponsor a team, we'll spend $10-15 million amplifying it through ads, hospitality, content, and retail. The real question isn't 'Can we afford the rights?'‚Äîit's 'Can we activate at scale?'"

[0:45-1:15] ROI Framework
"We measure three layers: Reach (how many people saw our brand?), Engagement (did they interact?), and Conversion (did they buy?). Reach is easy‚Äîbroadcast impressions, social media views. Engagement requires data partnerships‚Äîapp downloads, website visits. Conversion is hardest‚Äîtying sales to sponsorship exposure. That's where betting partnerships excel."

[1:15-1:45] Betting Integration Advantage
"When we partner with FanDuel or DraftKings, we access first-party data: who bet, what they bet on, when they converted. That attribution loop is impossible with traditional jersey sponsors. Sports betting operators offer co-marketing deals where we share customer acquisition costs and conversion data. It's why betting-integrated sponsorships command 20-30% premiums."

[1:45-2:00] Conclusion
"Your activation plan this week needs to answer: What's the reach? What's the engagement mechanism? How do we measure conversion? Think like a CFO, not just a marketer."

## Element 5: AI Chat Widget - Week 3 Diagnostic Pre-Assessment

**Element Type:** AI Chat Widget

**Priority:** ‚¨§ Required

**Time Estimate:** 6-9 minutes

**Purpose:** Activate prior knowledge before Week 3 instruction. Students answer 3 diagnostic questions about sponsorship benefits, ROI measurement, and betting's impact on sponsorships through conversational AI interaction. AI provides immediate encouraging feedback after each response.

---

### Uplimit Configuration

**Widget Name:** Week 3 Diagnostic Pre-Assessment

**System Prompt:**
```
You are a supportive diagnostic assessment assistant for an MBA-level Sports Marketing course. Your role is to help students activate their prior knowledge about sponsorships and betting BEFORE Week 3 instruction begins.

**Your Conversational Approach:**
- Cover 3 diagnostic topics through natural conversation (not rigid Q&A sequence)
- Ask thoughtful questions, listen to responses, provide encouraging feedback (75-100 words)
- Acknowledge correct understanding and gently note gaps
- Preview what they'll learn in Week 3
- Maintain growth-oriented tone (no criticism for knowledge gaps)
- Allow follow-up questions and natural conversational flow

**3 Topics to Cover (in any natural order):**

**Topic A: Sponsorship Benefits**
Ask about what sponsors get in exchange for paying teams/leagues (2-3 specific benefits, 50-75 words).
- Acknowledge if student mentions: brand visibility, logo placement, fan engagement, hospitality, activation rights, category exclusivity, data access
- Gently note if student missed key concepts without making them feel inadequate
- Preview: "This week you'll learn the full spectrum of sponsorship assets and how brands value them"
- Example feedback tone: "Great starting point! You've identified [X]. Many MBA students enter Week 3 with similar understanding. This week you'll discover how sponsors also gain [missed concepts] and learn how these benefits connect to business objectives."

**Topic B: ROI Measurement**
Ask how brands measure whether a sponsorship was successful (1-2 metrics, 50-75 words).
- Acknowledge if student mentions: brand awareness, impressions, social media engagement, sales lift, recall studies, attribution models
- Note sophistication level (basic awareness vs. advanced understanding)
- Preview: "This week you'll learn the ROI Calculator framework covering 8 key metrics across 3 measurement phases"
- Example feedback tone: "You're thinking in the right direction with [X]! This week's ROI Calculator will expand your toolkit to include [additional metrics] and show you how brands connect these metrics to financial outcomes."

**Topic C: Betting Impact on Sponsorships**
Ask how sports betting might change the value of traditional sponsorships (50-75 words, speculation welcomed).
- Acknowledge quality of speculation (higher engagement ‚Üí premium rates, betting brands competing for inventory, in-game moments, real-time activation)
- Note sophistication (direct observation vs. second-order effects vs. ecosystem thinking)
- Preview: "This week you'll analyze the FanDuel case and explore how betting partnerships reshape sponsorship economics"
- Example feedback tone: "Interesting speculation! You've identified [X], which shows [strategic thinking quality]. This week's FanDuel case will reveal how betting creates [additional connections] and why legacy sponsors are rethinking their activation strategies."

**Wrapping Up:**
After covering all 3 topics, summarize: "Thanks for this conversation! Based on your responses, you're entering Week 3 with [baseline summary]. This is exactly where most MBA students start. You're ready to dive into the sponsorship and betting content!"
- Do NOT score, grade, or rank responses
- Celebrate completion and curiosity

**Tone:** Supportive, encouraging, growth-oriented. Never criticize gaps. Frame gaps as learning opportunities.
```

**Welcome Message:**
```
Welcome to the Week 3 Diagnostic Pre-Assessment!

Before diving into sponsorship and betting content, let's have a quick conversation about what you already know. I'll ask about 3 topics: sponsorship benefits, ROI measurement, and betting's impact. This is **diagnostic only** (ungraded) - honest responses help you and your instructor understand your starting point.

**Time:** 6-9 minutes
**Format:** Conversational Q&A. You respond (50-75 words), I provide encouraging feedback, we move naturally through the 3 topics.

Ready? Let's chat!
```

**Show System Prompt to User:** No

### Implementation Notes

**Uplimit Setup Steps:**
1. Create AI Chat Widget element in Week 3, Module 1 (after Element 5: Vertical List)
2. Copy system prompt into Uplimit's AI Chat configuration
3. Copy welcome message
4. Set "Show System Prompt to User" to NO
5. Test with 2-3 sample responses per question to verify feedback quality

**Student Experience:**
- Click "Start Diagnostic Assessment" button
- AI asks about first topic ‚Üí Student types 50-75 word response ‚Üí AI provides encouraging feedback
- Conversation naturally progresses through all 3 topics (sponsorship benefits, ROI measurement, betting impact)
- AI can respond to follow-up questions or clarifications
- AI summarizes baseline and confirms readiness for Week 3
- Total interaction: 6-9 minutes (3 topics √ó 2-3 min each)

**Why This Works Better:**
- ‚úÖ Uses actual Uplimit platform features (AI Chat Widget)
- ‚úÖ Provides immediate feedback (no grading delay)
- ‚úÖ Conversational format reduces diagnostic anxiety
- ‚úÖ Students can ask clarifying questions if confused
- ‚úÖ Ungraded by default (perfect for diagnostic intent)
- ‚úÖ Single widget vs. 3 separate elements (cleaner UX)

**Assessment Integrity:**
- Diagnostic only (no points) - reduces pressure to use AI tools to "game" responses
- AI feedback is formative, not summative (encourages honest self-assessment)
- Instructor can review transcripts in Uplimit dashboard to understand class baseline knowledge

## Module 1 Complete - Transition to Module 2

**Completion Badge:** üèÜ Week 3 Objectives Clear

**What You've Accomplished:**
You've connected Week 2's media rights focus to Week 3's sponsorship and betting themes. You've heard from two executives (FanDuel operator and corporate sponsor) who introduced industry perspectives. You've activated your prior knowledge through diagnostic questions that revealed what you already know and what you'll learn this week.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Sponsorship is the financial backbone of sports (often exceeds ticketing revenue)
- Sports betting is the fastest-growing revenue stream (40% more viewership from bettors)
- Brands measure ROI through reach, engagement, and conversion‚Äînot just logo visibility
- Betting partnerships offer attribution advantages (first-party data, conversion tracking)

**Up Next: Module 2 - Sponsorship Framework**
Now that you understand why sponsorship matters, let's build the framework: how do brands evaluate partnership opportunities, calculate ROI, and design activations that deliver measurable value? You'll use interactive widgets to model real sponsorship deals and practice the ROI calculations brands use daily.

Ready to calculate ROI like a brand strategist? Let's build the framework!

## üéØ FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION

**How Module 1 Supports Your Week 5 Marketing Plan:**

Module 1 established why sponsorship and betting matter in sports business. This directly supports your final project's **Slide 4: Sponsorship/Media Strategy** section.

**What You Learned:**
- Sponsorship is the financial backbone of sport (often exceeds ticketing revenue)
- Sports betting is the fastest-growing revenue stream (40% more viewership from bettors)
- Brands measure ROI through reach, engagement, and conversion‚Äînot just logo visibility

**How to Apply This to Your Final Project:**
When you create your marketing plan in Week 5, you'll need to explain **how your sports property/team/event will make money**. Module 1 taught you that sponsorship and betting partnerships should be central to your revenue strategy. In your Slide 4, you'll reference:
- **Sponsorship tiers** (title sponsor, official partners, category sponsors)
- **Betting partnerships** (if legal in your market, this is a high-growth opportunity)
- **Why brands will pay** (your property delivers reach, engagement, and measurable outcomes)

**Action Item:** As you work on your final project, bookmark Module 1's executive videos (Andrew Sneyd and Brand Sponsor Leader). Their frameworks will help you justify why sponsors should invest in YOUR property.
