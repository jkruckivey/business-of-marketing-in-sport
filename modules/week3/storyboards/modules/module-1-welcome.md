Sponsorship & Betting: The Growth Engines

You've explored how media rights are valued, compared linear TV vs. streaming economics, and analyzed Rogers' $5.2B NHL deal. You understand how platforms monetize sports content through subscriptions, ads, and engagement.

But media rights are only one revenue stream. This week, we shift focus to two growth engines transforming sports business: sponsorship (the financial backbone that funds leagues, teams, and athletes) and sports betting (the fastest-growing revenue opportunity in North American sports).

These aren't independent topics—they're deeply interconnected. Sports betting partnerships are becoming the most valuable sponsorship category, brands activate through betting platforms, and fan engagement drives both sponsorship value and betting revenue. By the end of this week, you'll design a sponsorship activation plan that calculates measurable ROI.
