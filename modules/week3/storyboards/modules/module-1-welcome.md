## Element 1: Week 2→3 Transition Text

**Copy this markdown directly into Uplimit:**

```markdown
You've explored how media rights are valued, compared linear TV vs. streaming economics, and analyzed Rogers' $5.2B NHL deal. You understand how platforms monetize sports content through subscriptions, ads, and engagement.

But media rights are only one revenue stream. This week, we shift focus to two growth engines transforming sports business: **sponsorship** (the financial backbone that funds leagues, teams, and athletes) and **sports betting** (the fastest-growing revenue opportunity in North American sports).

These aren't independent topics—they're deeply interconnected. Sports betting partnerships are becoming the most valuable sponsorship category, brands activate through betting platforms, and fan engagement drives both sponsorship value and betting revenue. By the end of this week, you'll design a sponsorship activation plan that integrates both dimensions and calculates measurable ROI.
```

- **Accessibility:** Captions required, transcript provided

**Video Status:** 📝 Script complete, awaiting production and executive scheduling

  allowfullscreen
  loading="lazy">
</iframe>
```

**Video Script (2 minutes):**
```
[0:00-0:15] Introduction
"I lead sports sponsorship for [Brand]. We spend $XX million annually on partnerships. Here's how we decide where to invest—and how we measure success."

[0:15-0:45] Rights Fees vs. Activation
"A common mistake: thinking the rights fee is the investment. Wrong. For every $1 in rights fees, brands spend $2-3 on activation. If we pay $5 million to sponsor a team, we'll spend $10-15 million amplifying it through ads, hospitality, content, and retail. The real question isn't 'Can we afford the rights?'—it's 'Can we activate at scale?'"

[0:45-1:15] ROI Framework
"We measure three layers: Reach (how many people saw our brand?), Engagement (did they interact?), and Conversion (did they buy?). Reach is easy—broadcast impressions, social media views. Engagement requires data partnerships—app downloads, website visits. Conversion is hardest—tying sales to sponsorship exposure. That's where betting partnerships excel."

[1:15-1:45] Betting Integration Advantage
"When we partner with FanDuel or DraftKings, we access first-party data: who bet, what they bet on, when they converted. That attribution loop is impossible with traditional jersey sponsors. Sports betting operators offer co-marketing deals where we share customer acquisition costs and conversion data. It's why betting-integrated sponsorships command 20-30% premiums."

[1:45-2:00] Conclusion
"Your activation plan this week needs to answer: What's the reach? What's the engagement mechanism? How do we measure conversion? Think like a CFO, not just a marketer."

## Element 5: AI Chat Widget - Week 3 Diagnostic Pre-Assessment

**Element Type:** AI Chat Widget

**Priority:** ⬤ Required

**Time Estimate:** 6-9 minutes

**Purpose:** Activate prior knowledge before Week 3 instruction. Students answer 3 diagnostic questions about sponsorship benefits, ROI measurement, and betting's impact on sponsorships through conversational AI interaction. AI provides immediate encouraging feedback after each response.

---

### Uplimit Configuration

**Widget Name:** Week 3 Diagnostic Pre-Assessment

**System Prompt:**
```
You are a supportive diagnostic assessment assistant for an MBA-level Sports Marketing course. Your role is to help students activate their prior knowledge about sponsorships and betting BEFORE Week 3 instruction begins.

**Your Conversational Approach:**
- Cover 3 diagnostic topics through natural conversation (not rigid Q&A sequence)
- Ask thoughtful questions, listen to responses, provide encouraging feedback (75-100 words)
- Acknowledge correct understanding and gently note gaps
- Preview what they'll learn in Week 3
- Maintain growth-oriented tone (no criticism for knowledge gaps)
- Allow follow-up questions and natural conversational flow

**3 Topics to Cover (in any natural order):**

**Topic A: Sponsorship Benefits**
Ask about what sponsors get in exchange for paying teams/leagues (2-3 specific benefits, 50-75 words).
- Acknowledge if student mentions: brand visibility, logo placement, fan engagement, hospitality, activation rights, category exclusivity, data access
- Gently note if student missed key concepts without making them feel inadequate
- Preview: "This week you'll learn the full spectrum of sponsorship assets and how brands value them"
- Example feedback tone: "Great starting point! You've identified [X]. Many MBA students enter Week 3 with similar understanding. This week you'll discover how sponsors also gain [missed concepts] and learn how these benefits connect to business objectives."

**Topic B: ROI Measurement**
Ask how brands measure whether a sponsorship was successful (1-2 metrics, 50-75 words).
- Acknowledge if student mentions: brand awareness, impressions, social media engagement, sales lift, recall studies, attribution models
- Note sophistication level (basic awareness vs. advanced understanding)
- Preview: "This week you'll learn the ROI Calculator framework covering 8 key metrics across 3 measurement phases"
- Example feedback tone: "You're thinking in the right direction with [X]! This week's ROI Calculator will expand your toolkit to include [additional metrics] and show you how brands connect these metrics to financial outcomes."

**Topic C: Betting Impact on Sponsorships**
Ask how sports betting might change the value of traditional sponsorships (50-75 words, speculation welcomed).
- Acknowledge quality of speculation (higher engagement → premium rates, betting brands competing for inventory, in-game moments, real-time activation)
- Note sophistication (direct observation vs. second-order effects vs. ecosystem thinking)
- Preview: "This week you'll analyze the FanDuel case and explore how betting partnerships reshape sponsorship economics"
- Example feedback tone: "Interesting speculation! You've identified [X], which shows [strategic thinking quality]. This week's FanDuel case will reveal how betting creates [additional connections] and why legacy sponsors are rethinking their activation strategies."

**Wrapping Up:**
After covering all 3 topics, summarize: "Thanks for this conversation! Based on your responses, you're entering Week 3 with [baseline summary]. This is exactly where most MBA students start. You're ready to dive into the sponsorship and betting content!"
- Do NOT score, grade, or rank responses
- Celebrate completion and curiosity

**Tone:** Supportive, encouraging, growth-oriented. Never criticize gaps. Frame gaps as learning opportunities.
```

**Welcome Message:**
```
Welcome to the Week 3 Diagnostic Pre-Assessment!

Before diving into sponsorship and betting content, let's have a quick conversation about what you already know. I'll ask about 3 topics: sponsorship benefits, ROI measurement, and betting's impact. This is **diagnostic only** (ungraded) - honest responses help you and your instructor understand your starting point.

**Time:** 6-9 minutes
**Format:** Conversational Q&A. You respond (50-75 words), I provide encouraging feedback, we move naturally through the 3 topics.

Ready? Let's chat!
```

**Show System Prompt to User:** No

---

### Implementation Notes

**Uplimit Setup Steps:**
1. Create AI Chat Widget element in Week 3, Module 1 (after Element 5: Vertical List)
2. Copy system prompt into Uplimit's AI Chat configuration
3. Copy welcome message
4. Set "Show System Prompt to User" to NO
5. Test with 2-3 sample responses per question to verify feedback quality

**Student Experience:**
- Click "Start Diagnostic Assessment" button
- AI asks about first topic → Student types 50-75 word response → AI provides encouraging feedback
- Conversation naturally progresses through all 3 topics (sponsorship benefits, ROI measurement, betting impact)
- AI can respond to follow-up questions or clarifications
- AI summarizes baseline and confirms readiness for Week 3
- Total interaction: 6-9 minutes (3 topics × 2-3 min each)

**Why This Works Better:**
- ✅ Uses actual Uplimit platform features (AI Chat Widget)
- ✅ Provides immediate feedback (no grading delay)
- ✅ Conversational format reduces diagnostic anxiety
- ✅ Students can ask clarifying questions if confused
- ✅ Ungraded by default (perfect for diagnostic intent)
- ✅ Single widget vs. 3 separate elements (cleaner UX)

**Assessment Integrity:**
- Diagnostic only (no points) - reduces pressure to use AI tools to "game" responses
- AI feedback is formative, not summative (encourages honest self-assessment)
- Instructor can review transcripts in Uplimit dashboard to understand class baseline knowledge

## Module 1 Complete - Transition to Module 2

**Completion Badge:** 🏆 Week 3 Objectives Clear

**What You've Accomplished:**
You've connected Week 2's media rights focus to Week 3's sponsorship and betting themes. You've heard from two executives (FanDuel operator and corporate sponsor) who introduced industry perspectives. You've activated your prior knowledge through diagnostic questions that revealed what you already know and what you'll learn this week.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Sponsorship is the financial backbone of sports (often exceeds ticketing revenue)
- Sports betting is the fastest-growing revenue stream (40% more viewership from bettors)
- Brands measure ROI through reach, engagement, and conversion—not just logo visibility
- Betting partnerships offer attribution advantages (first-party data, conversion tracking)

**Up Next: Module 2 - Sponsorship Framework**
Now that you understand why sponsorship matters, let's build the framework: how do brands evaluate partnership opportunities, calculate ROI, and design activations that deliver measurable value? You'll use interactive widgets to model real sponsorship deals and practice the ROI calculations brands use daily.

Ready to calculate ROI like a brand strategist? Let's build the framework!

- ❌ <3 Phase 1 widgets complete → Delay Week 3 launch OR use all fallbacks (static templates)

---

## Quality Assurance Checklist (All Widgets)

Before marking any widget "complete," verify:
- [ ] WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, screen reader support, high contrast, focus indicators)
- [ ] Real-world data examples with sources (CPM benchmarks, engagement rates, conversion rates)
- [ ] JSON export functionality working (students need data for activation plan)
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design (breakpoints at 768px)
- [ ] Chart.js visualizations rendering correctly
- [ ] Input validation working (e.g., sliders sum to 100%, no negative numbers)
- [ ] Error handling for edge cases
- [ ] Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

---

## Instructor Communication

**If Phase 1 widgets aren't ready 2 weeks before Week 3:**

Email to students:
> "Week 3's sponsorship activation plan assignment will use a mix of interactive widgets (where ready) and Excel/Google Sheets templates (where widgets are still in development). Both approaches teach the same ROI calculation skills—widgets are more engaging, but templates are equally rigorous. We'll update you on widget availability status [Date]."

**This transparency maintains student trust while managing development risk.**
