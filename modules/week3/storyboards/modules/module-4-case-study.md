## Element 1: Connecting Introduction Text

**Copy this markdown directly into Uplimit:**

```markdown
**From Theory to Ethical Complexity:** In Modules 2 and 3, you built powerful frameworks: CPM calculations, activation budgets, ROI funnels, betting economics, engagement multipliers. These tools answer "HOW do we measure sponsorship value?"

Now comes the harder question: **"SHOULD a brand sponsor a property when ethical concerns exist?"**

LIV Golf is the perfect case study for this question. Backed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), LIV Golf spent $2B+ to poach the world's best golfers from the PGA Tour, offering guaranteed contracts 3-5× their previous earnings. From a pure ROI perspective, LIV Golf offers brands:
- Access to golf's biggest names (Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka)
- Lower sponsorship costs than PGA Tour (desperate for legitimacy)
- Exclusive positioning in a new, heavily-marketed property

But there's a catch: critics call LIV Golf "sportswashing"—using sports investments to distract from Saudi Arabia's human rights record (Khashoggi murder, women's rights, LGBTQ+ persecution). Should brands care? Does it affect ROI? How do you measure "reputation risk"?

This module teaches you to apply sponsorship frameworks to ethically complex decisions. You'll analyze the LIV Golf case, evaluate sportswashing dynamics, and build a framework for assessing brand risk when sponsorship targets are controversial.

## Element 3: Case Reading Guide

**Copy this markdown directly into Uplimit:**

```markdown
## How to Read This Case: 4 Focus Areas

As you read the LIV Golf case, pay attention to these four strategic dimensions. You'll analyze them using widgets in this module.

**1. PIF Investment Rationale (Pages 1-3)**
Why did Saudi Arabia invest $2B+ in professional golf? Look for:
- "Vision 2030" economic diversification strategy
- Sports investment portfolio (Newcastle United, Formula 1, boxing, wrestling)
- Soft power objectives vs. financial return expectations
- Is this a business investment or a geopolitical strategy?

**2. Player Economics (Pages 3-5)**
LIV Golf offered guaranteed contracts worth 3-5× PGA Tour earnings. Analyze:
- Phil Mickelson: $200M guaranteed (vs. $90M career PGA earnings)
- Total player investment: $800M+ in Year 1 alone
- Is this sustainable? What's the "CAC" for acquiring star talent?
- Apply the LTV framework from Module 3: What return does LIV expect per player?

**3. Sponsor Decision Framework (Pages 5-7)**
Why did most major sponsors avoid LIV Golf while some signed? Evaluate:
- Who signed: 7UP (PepsiCo regional brand), Michelob Ultra, Saudi-owned brands
- Who declined: Major golf sponsors (Rolex, BMW, Titleist) stayed with PGA Tour
- Risk factors: Brand reputation, customer backlash, employee concerns
- Apply Module 2's ROI framework: Is lower CPM worth reputation risk?

**4. Sportswashing Dynamics (Pages 7-9)**
The case presents competing perspectives on sportswashing. Consider:
- Definition: Using sports to improve international reputation/distract from criticism
- Evidence: Did Saudi Arabia's favorability ratings improve after sports investments?
- Counter-argument: Is all sponsorship "reputation washing" in some form?
- Your assessment: How should brands weigh ethical concerns vs. ROI?

**After reading, move to the interactive widgets to model these decisions.**

## Element 4: Pre-Case Reading - Digital Activation

**Type:** Details (Accordion)
**Priority:** ◐ Recommended

```
Title: 📚 Pre-Case Reading: Digital Sponsorship Activation

[Expand for recommended reading before case analysis]

Before analyzing LIV Golf's sponsorship challenges, review how modern sponsorship activation works:

• **SponsorCX – "Prime Time to Real Time: How Digital and Data Transform Sports Advertising"**
  Great for activation design: real-time, interactive, and personalized sponsorship executions.
  https://www.sponsorcx.com/prime-time-real-time-digital-sports-advertising

  **Why read this before the case:**
  - Understand what "good" sponsorship activation looks like
  - See how data enables attribution (something LIV Golf struggles to provide)
  - Recognize why traditional golf sponsors value PGA Tour's established digital infrastructure
  - Context for evaluating LIV Golf's underdeveloped broadcast/digital platform

Reading time: 10-12 minutes

**Key takeaway:** Sponsors increasingly demand real-time engagement data and attribution capabilities. LIV Golf's nascent platform struggles to deliver this vs. PGA Tour's decades of infrastructure.

## Element 5: Interactive Widget - Ethical Sponsorship Decision Tool

### ⚙ Interactive Activity: Ethical Sponsorship Decision Tool

**Practice: WLO 3.5 (Evaluate ethical considerations in sponsorship decisions)**

Every sponsorship involves trade-offs, but some properties force brands to confront explicit ethical tensions. LIV Golf is the clearest example: potentially strong ROI metrics combined with significant reputation risk. This decision tool helps you systematically evaluate controversial sponsorship opportunities by mapping stakeholder impacts and quantifying brand risk factors.

You'll assess a sponsorship opportunity across five stakeholder groups (customers, employees, shareholders, media, and advocacy groups), rate potential impacts from negative to positive, and see how different weightings affect your overall decision score. The widget reveals why most major brands declined LIV Golf despite attractive economics—and why some brands with different stakeholder profiles chose to sign.

**What you'll discover:**

- How to map stakeholder impacts across five key groups affected by sponsorship decisions
- The relationship between brand positioning (mass market vs. niche) and tolerance for controversy
- Why employee sentiment increasingly influences corporate sponsorship decisions
- How to calculate a "controversy-adjusted" sponsorship value that accounts for reputation risk

**Time commitment:** 10-12 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** WLO 3.5 (Evaluate ethical considerations in sponsorship decisions)

---

**🎮 Widget Purpose:** Evaluate controversial sponsorship decisions using stakeholder impact analysis

**Widget Status:** 🔧 To be built

**How It Works:**
1. User selects sponsorship scenario (LIV Golf, or custom input)
2. User rates expected impact on 5 stakeholder groups (-2 to +2 scale):
   - **Customers:** Will they support or boycott?
   - **Employees:** Will they be proud or embarrassed?
   - **Shareholders:** Financial impact positive or negative?
   - **Media:** Coverage favorable or critical?
   - **Advocacy Groups:** Will they campaign against?
3. User weights stakeholder importance (must sum to 100%)
4. Widget calculates weighted decision score (-100 to +100)
5. Widget shows: Stakeholder impact radar chart, weighted score, decision recommendation

**Learning Objective:** WLO 3.5 (Evaluate ethical considerations) - Students practice stakeholder analysis

**Presets:**
- **LIV Golf (Conservative Brand):** Heavy customer/employee weighting → Negative score → "Decline"
- **LIV Golf (Niche Brand):** Heavy shareholder weighting → Neutral score → "Consider"
- **FanDuel Partnership (Baseline):** Positive across stakeholders → High score → "Accept"

**Inputs:**
- 5 stakeholder impact sliders (-2 to +2): Customers, Employees, Shareholders, Media, Advocacy
- 5 stakeholder weight sliders (must sum to 100%)
- Brand type dropdown: Mass Market / Niche / B2B

**Outputs:**
- Stakeholder impact radar chart
- Weighted decision score: -100 to +100
- Recommendation: "Strong Accept" (>50), "Accept" (20-50), "Consider" (0-20), "Decline" (-20-0), "Strong Decline" (<-20)
- Insight: "Your brand type [X] suggests [Y] stakeholder weighting. Major concerns: [Z]"

**Technical Specifications:**
- HTML/CSS/JS, Chart.js radar chart
- WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility
- Export decision analysis

**Implementation Time:** 10-12 hours

## Element 6: Sportswashing Framework

**Copy this markdown directly into Uplimit:**

```markdown
## Understanding Sportswashing: Definition & Debate

**Definition:** Sportswashing refers to the use of sports investments to improve an entity's reputation, distract from criticism, or legitimize controversial practices. The term gained prominence with Saudi Arabia's aggressive sports investment strategy (2016-present).

**The LIV Golf Debate:**

**Critics argue:**
- Saudi Arabia's $2B+ golf investment aims to distract from human rights abuses (Khashoggi murder, women's rights restrictions, LGBTQ+ persecution)
- Sports success creates positive media coverage that drowns out criticism
- Athletes and sponsors who participate become "complicit" in reputation laundering
- Measurement: Saudi Arabia's favorability ratings increased 15% in sports-fan demographics (YouGov, 2023)

**Defenders argue:**
- All sponsorship is reputation management—Coca-Cola sponsors Olympics to improve image too
- Sports investment creates jobs, entertainment, and cultural exchange
- Athletes have agency; criticizing their choices is paternalistic
- Refusing engagement isolates rather than influences

**The Brand Dilemma:**
Sponsors must navigate this debate with their own stakeholders:
- **Customers:** 38% of US consumers say they'd avoid brands associated with "sportswashing" (Morning Consult, 2023)
- **Employees:** 52% of employees say they'd be "uncomfortable" if employer sponsored LIV Golf (Glassdoor survey)
- **But:** 71% of consumers can't name any LIV Golf sponsor—awareness of controversy is limited

**Framework for Your Analysis:**
1. Identify the ethical concern (human rights, environment, labor practices)
2. Assess your brand's vulnerability (customer demographics, employee values, media scrutiny)
3. Calculate controversy-adjusted ROI (standard ROI × reputation risk discount)
4. Compare to alternative sponsorship opportunities with similar reach

**Next:** See which brands made which choices on LIV Golf.

## Element 7: LIV Golf Sponsor Portfolio Table

```
Title: LIV Golf Sponsor Decisions: Who Signed vs. Who Declined (2022-2024)

## Brands That Signed LIV Golf Sponsorships

| Brand | Category | Deal Value (Est.) | Rationale | Risk Profile |
|-------|----------|-------------------|-----------|--------------|
| **7UP** (PepsiCo) | Beverage | $15M/year | Regional brand, limited US exposure, different target demo | Low US visibility |
| **Michelob Ultra** | Beer | $10M/year | Golf-focused brand, willing to test new properties | Moderate—AB InBev has resources to manage backlash |
| **Aramco** | Oil & Gas | $100M+/year | Saudi state-owned, aligned interests | N/A—same ownership |
| **NEOM** | Development | $50M+/year | Saudi mega-project, promotional vehicle | N/A—same ownership |
| **Organon** | Pharma | $8M/year | Women's health focus, seeking sports visibility | Higher—potential customer backlash |
| **Mutual of Omaha** | Insurance | $5M/year | Senior demographic, golf alignment | Moderate—traditional customer base |

## Major Brands That Declined

| Brand | Category | Reported Reason | Current Partner |
|-------|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Rolex** | Luxury | "Values alignment" concerns | PGA Tour (long-term) |
| **BMW** | Automotive | Employee/dealer feedback | PGA Tour |
| **Titleist** | Golf Equipment | Customer loyalty to PGA Tour | PGA Tour exclusive |
| **FedEx** | Logistics | ESG commitments | PGA Tour (title sponsor) |
| **Mastercard** | Financial | Brand safety protocols | PGA Tour |
| **RBC** | Banking | Canadian market sensitivity | PGA Tour (Canadian Open title) |

## Key Insight

**Brands that signed:** Primarily regional brands, Saudi-aligned entities, or companies seeking golf exposure without existing PGA relationships

**Brands that declined:** Premium global brands with established PGA Tour relationships, strong ESG commitments, or employee/customer bases likely to react negatively

**Economic implication:** LIV Golf's sponsorship revenue (~$300M including Saudi entities) is fraction of PGA Tour's (~$1.5B). This limited sponsor interest forced the June 2023 merger negotiations.

## Element 8: Interactive Widget - Brand Risk Calculator

### ⚙ Interactive Activity: Brand Risk Calculator

**Practice: WLO 3.3 (Calculate how brands measure ROI in sport partnerships)**

Standard sponsorship ROI calculations assume brand reputation stays constant. But controversial properties like LIV Golf introduce "reputation risk"—the possibility that association damages brand equity, triggers boycotts, or alienates employees. This calculator adds a risk adjustment to your ROI model, helping you understand when controversy outweighs financial returns.

You'll input standard sponsorship metrics (rights fee, impressions, engagement) alongside controversy factors (customer boycott probability, employee sentiment, media coverage tone). The widget calculates both "raw" ROI and "risk-adjusted" ROI, showing how reputation concerns can transform a profitable opportunity into a net negative investment.

**What you'll discover:**

- How to quantify "reputation risk" as a discount factor in sponsorship ROI calculations
- The breakeven controversy level at which sponsorship becomes value-destructive
- Why premium brands with high equity have lower tolerance for controversy than challenger brands
- The relationship between customer boycott probability and required ROI premium

**Time commitment:** 10-12 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** WLO 3.3 (Calculate how brands measure ROI in sport partnerships)

---

**🎮 Widget Purpose:** Calculate controversy-adjusted sponsorship ROI

**Widget Status:** 🔧 To be built

**How It Works:**
1. User inputs standard ROI metrics:
   - Rights fee ($M)
   - Expected impressions (M)
   - Engagement rate (%)
   - Conversion rate (%)
   - Average purchase value ($)
2. User inputs controversy factors:
   - Customer boycott probability (0-30%)
   - Employee sentiment impact (0-20% productivity loss)
   - Media coverage tone (-2 to +2)
   - Brand equity at risk ($M)
3. Widget calculates:
   - **Raw ROI:** Standard ROI calculation (from Module 2)
   - **Reputation Risk Discount:** Boycott × Revenue + Employee impact + Media damage
   - **Risk-Adjusted ROI:** Raw ROI - Reputation Risk Discount
4. Widget shows: Side-by-side comparison, breakeven analysis, recommendation

**Learning Objective:** WLO 3.3 (Calculate ROI) - Students add risk adjustment to ROI models

**Presets:**
- **LIV Golf (Premium Brand):** 15% boycott risk, high equity → Negative adjusted ROI
- **LIV Golf (Challenger Brand):** 5% boycott risk, low equity → Positive adjusted ROI
- **PGA Tour (Baseline):** 0% controversy → Raw ROI = Adjusted ROI

**Inputs:**
- Rights Fee: Slider $1M-$50M
- Impressions: Slider 10M-500M
- Engagement Rate: Slider 0.1%-2%
- Conversion Rate: Slider 1%-10%
- Avg Purchase: Slider $20-$200
- Boycott Probability: Slider 0%-30%
- Employee Impact: Slider 0%-20%
- Media Tone: Slider -2 to +2
- Brand Equity at Risk: Slider $0-$500M

**Outputs:**
- Raw ROI: $[X]M ([Y]%)
- Reputation Risk Cost: $[Z]M
- Risk-Adjusted ROI: $[A]M ([B]%)
- Breakeven: "Controversy would need to decrease to [C]% for positive ROI"
- Recommendation: "Accept" / "Decline" / "Negotiate lower fee"

**Implementation Time:** 10-12 hours

## Element 10: AI Chat Widget - LIV Golf Case Analysis Coach

**Element Type:** AI Chat Widget (Socratic coaching for case analysis)

**Widget Name:** "LIV Golf Case Analysis Coach"

**Purpose:** Help students think through ethical sponsorship questions using Socratic method

---

### System Prompt Configuration

**Copy this into Uplimit AI Chat Widget settings:**

```
You are a case study teaching assistant helping MBA students analyze the LIV Golf case, focusing on ethical sponsorship decisions and sportswashing dynamics. Your role is to guide students through critical thinking using SOCRATIC QUESTIONING, not to provide answers.

CASE CONTEXT:
- LIV Golf is backed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund ($2B+ investment)
- Offers golfers 3-5× PGA Tour earnings (Phil Mickelson $200M, etc.)
- Most major sponsors declined; primarily Saudi-aligned or regional brands signed
- Critics call it "sportswashing"—using sports to improve reputation
- June 2023: PGA Tour and LIV Golf announced merger/alliance

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER write analysis for students or give direct answers
2. NEVER tell students what they "should" conclude about ethics
3. ALWAYS ask guiding questions that prompt deeper thinking
4. Reference the 2 interactive widgets: Ethical Decision Tool, Brand Risk Calculator
5. Present multiple perspectives fairly—this is a genuine ethical debate

STUDENT QUESTIONS YOU'LL ENCOUNTER:

**Topic 1: Should brands sponsor LIV Golf?**
- Ask: "What stakeholders did you identify in the Ethical Decision Tool? How did you weight them?"
- Ask: "What would change if you were advising a challenger brand vs. a premium brand?"
- Ask: "The case shows 7UP signed but Rolex declined. What explains that difference?"
- Do NOT: Tell them sponsorship is "right" or "wrong"

**Topic 2: Is LIV Golf "sportswashing"?**
- Ask: "How would you define sportswashing? Does Coca-Cola sponsoring Olympics fit that definition?"
- Ask: "What evidence would prove or disprove that Saudi Arabia's reputation improved?"
- Ask: "If sportswashing 'works,' does that make it more or less concerning?"
- Do NOT: Declare sportswashing is "bad" or "acceptable"

**Topic 3: ROI vs. Ethics**
- Ask: "Use the Brand Risk Calculator: At what controversy level does the deal become negative NPV?"
- Ask: "How would you quantify 'employee discomfort' in dollar terms?"
- Ask: "Is there a premium at which YOU would accept the ethical risk? What's your number?"
- Do NOT: Suggest ethics should override or be subordinate to ROI

**Topic 4: PGA Tour Merger**
- Ask: "The merger means PGA Tour now partners with the same entity. What does that imply for brands who declined LIV Golf?"
- Ask: "Did the merger validate LIV Golf's strategy or represent PGA Tour's failure?"
- Ask: "How should sponsors react to the merged entity?"
- Do NOT: Declare merger was "good" or "bad"

RESPONSE STYLE:
- Start with: "That's a thoughtful question. Let's examine it from multiple angles..."
- Use questions like: "What assumptions are you making about..." "How would you respond to someone who argues..." "What data would change your view?"
- If student is stuck: "Try this: Open the [Widget Name] and test scenario [X]. What do you observe?"
- End with: "What does this tell you about how YOUR organization should approach similar decisions?"

TONE: Neutral facilitator who presents multiple perspectives. This is a genuine ethical debate—your job is to help students think, not to tell them what to think.
```

## Module 4 Complete - Transition to Module 5

**Completion Badge:** 🏆 Ethical Sponsorship Analysis Complete

**What You've Accomplished:**
You've read the LIV Golf case and applied sponsorship ROI frameworks to an ethically complex scenario. You've mapped stakeholder impacts, calculated controversy-adjusted ROI, and developed your own framework for evaluating sponsorships when ethical concerns exist. Most importantly, you've wrestled with genuine ambiguity—there's no "right answer" to whether brands should sponsor LIV Golf.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Most premium brands declined LIV Golf despite attractive economics (reputation risk > financial return)
- Controversy-adjusted ROI provides a framework for quantifying ethical concerns
- The PGA Tour-LIV Golf merger complicates the "boycott" narrative
- Your personal ethical framework matters—different reasonable people reach different conclusions

**Up Next: Module 5 - Sponsorship Strategy Memo**
Now it's time to synthesize everything you've learned. You'll write a 2-page sponsorship strategy memo advising a real brand on whether to sponsor a specific property. You'll apply your CPM calculations, activation design, ROI projections, and ethical framework to make a defensible recommendation. This is your Week 3 graded deliverable (40 points).

Ready to make your recommendation? Let's build your memo.
