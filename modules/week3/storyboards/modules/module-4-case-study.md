## Element 1: Connecting Introduction Text

**Copy this markdown directly into Uplimit:**

```markdown
You've built the frameworks: sponsorship ROI (CPM, activation budgets), betting economics (market modeling, engagement multipliers), and partnership valuation (betting sponsor premiums). Now it's time to apply everything to a real company.

FanDuel went from zero to the #1 sports betting operator in the US in just 5 years (2018-2023). They captured 45% market share, built partnerships with NFL, NBA, NHL, and PGA Tour, and spent $1.2 billion on customer acquisition. How did they do it? And more importantly: was it worth it?

This case study teaches you how operators compete in a capital-intensive, regulation-fragmented, partnership-driven industry. You'll analyze FanDuel's competitive positioning, evaluate their partnership ROI, model customer economics, and assess whether their strategy is sustainable.

**Your task:** Read the HBS case (20-25 minutes), then use interactive widgets to analyze FanDuel's decisions. This prepares you for Module 5's group sprint—you'll design a sponsorship activation plan for a brand partnering with a betting operator.

## How to Read This Case: 4 Focus Areas

As you read the FanDuel case, pay attention to these four strategic dimensions. You'll analyze them using widgets in this module.

**1. Competitive Positioning (Exhibits 1-3)**
How does FanDuel differentiate from DraftKings and BetMGM? Look for:
- Market share data (FanDuel 45%, DraftKings 25%, others 30%)
- User experience differences (app design, betting options, live betting features)
- State-by-state presence (who launched first in key markets like New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan?)
- Pricing strategy (promotional spend, bonus offers, VIP programs)

**2. Partnership Strategy (Exhibits 4-6)**
Why did FanDuel bid $1B+ for NFL partnership when DraftKings bid $900M? Analyze:
- Exclusivity vs. shared deals (NFL has 3 partners, NBA has 2)
- Integration depth (in-app, broadcast, in-stadium)
- Data rights (NFL shares official betting data for $50M/year—worth it?)
- Attribution value (can FanDuel track which NFL fans convert? How?)

**3. Customer Economics (Exhibit 7)**
FanDuel spends $400 to acquire each customer. Is that sustainable? Calculate:
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): Marketing + promotions + bonuses per new customer
- Lifetime Value (LTV): Avg customer wagers $2,400/year, FanDuel earns 7% margin = $168/year, customer stays 10 years = $1,680 LTV
- Payback period: CAC $400 / Annual profit $168 = 2.4 years to breakeven
- Profitability: If customer stays >2.4 years, FanDuel profits. But 40% churn in Year 1. Problem?

**4. Sustainability Questions**
By 2024, FanDuel is profitable. But will it last? Consider:
- Competitive intensity: DraftKings, BetMGM, ESPN Bet, Fanatics all cutting into share
- CAC inflation: Marketing costs rising 15-20% annually as competition increases
- Regulatory risk: New taxes (New York's 51% tax rate destroyed profitability), advertising restrictions
- International expansion: Can FanDuel compete in UK/EU against established operators (bet365, William Hill)?

**After reading, move to the interactive widgets to model these decisions.**

# Practice: Analyze FanDuel's Competitive Position

After reading the HBS case, you understand FanDuel's strategy. Now let's analyze HOW they built 45% market share. Use the **Competitive Analysis Tool** to compare FanDuel vs. DraftKings vs. BetMGM across 8 dimensions.

## Your Challenge

You're a consultant advising FanDuel's CEO. She asks: "Where are we strongest vs. DraftKings? Where are we vulnerable?" You'll use the widget to build a data-driven competitive assessment using 2024 industry data.

## What You'll Practice

- Comparing operators across 8 competitive dimensions (market share, app rating, promo spend, partnerships, state coverage, product breadth, live betting, brand power)
- Interpreting radar charts to visualize competitive position
- Identifying competitive advantages and vulnerabilities
- Connecting case study insights to real-world data

## How the Analysis Tool Works

1. **Select Two Operators:** Choose from FanDuel, DraftKings, BetMGM, Caesars, ESPN Bet, Fanatics
2. **See Radar Chart:** 8-dimension comparison on 0-100 scale (normalized for visual comparison)
3. **Review Scorecard:** Raw metrics table (45% market share, 4.7/5 app rating, etc.)
4. **Read Insights:** Auto-generated competitive analysis explaining advantages, vulnerabilities, strategic recommendations

## Strategic Considerations

- **FanDuel's dominance stems from 3 advantages:** (1) First-mover from DFS era (brand recognition), (2) Aggressive partnerships (NFL/NBA/NHL/PGA/NASCAR), (3) Superior UX (4.7/5 rating vs. competitors' 3.6-4.5)
- **DraftKings' challenge:** 25% share but higher costs ($390 CAC vs. FanDuel's $400, but lower partnership efficiency). Strong in MLB (exclusive), weak in NFL (shared with FanDuel).
- **BetMGM's niche:** 12% share via casino cross-sell. Lower CAC ($350) from existing MGM Rewards members, but limited growth ceiling (can't scale beyond casino customer base).
- **New entrants struggle:** ESPN Bet (5% share) and Fanatics (3% share) spend $600+ CAC (100% promo spend) but face product/state coverage deficits.

## After the Widget

Export your competitive analysis. Use it to answer case questions: "How sustainable is FanDuel's lead?" and "What should DraftKings do to close the gap?"

### ⚙ Interactive Activity: FanDuel Competitive Analysis Tool

**Practice: WLO 3.2 (Analyze sports betting as a new growth driver in the industry)**

FanDuel dominates the US sports betting market with 45% share, but how did they achieve this leadership position? And what competitive advantages sustain it against rivals like DraftKings and BetMGM? This competitive analysis tool lets you compare operators across eight strategic dimensions to understand what separates market leaders from challengers.

You'll select two operators to compare and visualize their competitive positioning across market share, app quality, promotional spending, partnership portfolio, state availability, product breadth, live betting capabilities, and brand recognition. Using real data from the FanDuel case study and 2024 industry reports, you'll see how FanDuel's partnership strategy (5 major league deals including NFL, NBA, NHL) and superior app experience (4.7 rating) create defensible advantages. The radar chart visualization makes competitive gaps immediately visible and helps you identify strategic opportunities.

**What you'll discover:**

- How to conduct multi-dimensional competitive analysis using radar charts to visualize strategic positioning
- FanDuel's key competitive advantages: market share leadership, app quality, and partnership portfolio depth
- The role of promotional spending ($420 per customer) in customer acquisition and how it affects profitability
- How state regulatory approval and product breadth (200+ bet types) create barriers to entry for new competitors

**Time commitment:** 9-11 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** WLO 3.2 (Analyze sports betting as a new growth driver in the industry)

## FanDuel's $1B+ Partnership Strategy: Worth It?

FanDuel made a bold bet: spend aggressively on league partnerships to build brand recognition, user trust, and distribution advantages. Here's what they paid:

**Major League Partnerships (2020-2024):**
- **NFL:** $275M over 5 years ($55M/year) - shared with DraftKings and Caesars
- **NBA:** $120M over 3 years ($40M/year) - shared with DraftKings
- **NHL:** $60M over 3 years ($20M/year) - shared with BetMGM and Caesars
- **PGA Tour:** $50M over 3 years ($17M/year) - exclusive through 2027
- **NASCAR:** $25M over 3 years ($8M/year) - exclusive

**Total:** ~$1.1 billion over 5 years (~$220M per year in partnership rights fees)

**What FanDuel Gets:**
1. **"Official Betting Partner" designation** - Legitimacy, trust signal for new bettors
2. **Media integrations** - Betting odds shown during broadcasts (NBC, ESPN, Fox), in-stadium betting kiosks
3. **Data rights** - Official league data feeds for live betting (faster updates than third-party providers)
4. **Exclusivity benefits** - PGA/NASCAR exclusive = no DraftKings competition, customer acquisition cheaper
5. **Co-marketing** - Leagues promote FanDuel app in emails, social media, fantasy football content

**ROI Justification (from case Exhibit 6):**
- **Attribution:** NFL partnership drives 2.5M new customers over 5 years = $275M rights fee / 2.5M = $110 CAC (73% cheaper than normal $400 CAC)
- **LTV:** Those customers stay longer (brand trust) = 12-year avg vs. 10-year baseline = $168/year × 12 years = $2,016 LTV
- **ROI:** $2,016 LTV - $110 CAC = $1,906 profit per customer × 2.5M customers = **$4.77B profit on $275M investment (1,634% ROI)**

**But:** This assumes 12-year retention and attributes ALL customer growth to NFL partnership. Case questions whether this is realistic.

**Next widget:** Model customer acquisition economics to test FanDuel's assumptions.

```
Title: FanDuel Partnership Portfolio Summary (2024)

| Partnership | Annual Cost | Type | Key Benefits | Exclusivity | ROI Assumption (Case) |
|-------------|-------------|------|--------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **NFL** | $55M | Shared (3 partners) | In-game odds, data rights, broadcast integration | No (shares with DraftKings, Caesars) | 2.5M new customers over 5 years, $110 CAC |
| **NBA** | $40M | Shared (2 partners) | Court-side kiosks, data rights, fantasy integration | No (shares with DraftKings) | 1.8M new customers, $130 CAC |
| **NHL** | $20M | Shared (3 partners) | Broadcast segments, in-arena betting | No (shares with BetMGM, Caesars) | 800K new customers, $150 CAC |
| **PGA Tour** | $17M | **Exclusive** | Every tournament, data exclusivity, hospitality | **Yes (exclusive through 2027)** | 600K new customers, $85 CAC (cheaper due to exclusivity) |
| **NASCAR** | $8M | **Exclusive** | In-race betting, driver endorsements | **Yes (exclusive)** | 350K new customers, $70 CAC |
| **TVG (Horse Racing)** | Owned | Owned property | FanDuel acquired TVG Network (horse racing), vertical integration | N/A | No acquisition cost, 100% margin |
| **Content Partnerships** | ~$30M | Various | ESPN, Fox Bet integration (before ESPN Bet launch), Pat McAfee Show, Barstool Sports | Varies | Estimated 1.2M new customers, $150 CAC |

**Total Annual Partnership Spend:** ~$170M in 2024 (down from $220M peak in 2021-2022)

**Total Customers Acquired (Attributed):** 7.25M over 5 years (case estimate)

**Blended CAC from Partnerships:** $1.1B total spend / 7.25M customers = **$152 CAC** (62% cheaper than paid marketing $400 CAC)

**Case Question:** Can FanDuel prove attribution? Or are they paying for customers who would have signed up anyway?

## Element 6A: Widget Introduction - Customer Acquisition Economics Calculator

**Copy this markdown directly into Uplimit:**

```markdown
# Practice: Model FanDuel's Customer Economics

The case presents FanDuel's bold claim: NFL partnerships deliver $110 CAC (vs. $400 paid marketing). But does the math work? Model the **full customer economics** to test FanDuel's partnership ROI justification.

## Your Challenge

You're FanDuel's CFO presenting to the Board. A skeptical director asks: "If we're paying $55M/year for NFL rights, what's the true profit per customer after accounting for churn and lifetime value?" You'll use the **Customer Economics Calculator** to build a complete financial model.

## What You'll Practice

- Calculating annual profit per customer (wager × operator margin)
- Modeling lifetime value (LTV) with churn adjustments
- Computing payback period (time to breakeven on CAC)
- Performing sensitivity analysis (what happens if churn increases 10%?)
- Testing FanDuel's partnership ROI assumptions from the case

## How the Calculator Works

1. **Input CAC:** Customer acquisition cost (case: $400 paid marketing, $152 partnerships)
2. **Input Avg Annual Wager:** Typical customer betting volume (case: $2,400/year)
3. **Input Operator Margin:** House edge/profit margin (typical: 7%)
4. **Input Customer Tenure:** Max years customer stays (case: 10 years)
5. **Input Year 1 Churn:** % who quit after first year (typical: 40%)
6. **See Timeline:** Profitability chart showing Year 0 loss (CAC) → Year 2-3 breakeven → Year 10 cumulative profit

## Strategic Considerations

- **FanDuel's base case:** $400 CAC, $2,400 wager, 7% margin, 10-year tenure, 40% churn = $608 profit per customer, 2.4-year payback. Tight but profitable.
- **Partnership case:** $152 CAC (62% lower), same assumptions = $856 profit per customer (41% higher). **This is why they bid $1.1B on partnerships.**
- **Churn sensitivity:** If Year 1 churn increases from 40% → 50% (10% worse retention), profit drops from $608 → $420 (31% decline). Retention is CRITICAL.
- **CAC inflation risk:** Marketing costs rising 15-20%/year as competition increases. $400 → $460 CAC in 3 years. Partnerships become mandatory, not optional.
- **Multi-year view:** Operators rarely profit in Year 1. FanDuel's strategy bets on 3-5 year customer relationships. If regulators ban partnerships or tax rates increase (New York 51%), economics collapse.

## After the Widget

Export your customer economics model. Test the sensitivity scenarios (CAC +10%, churn +10%). Use this to answer the case's central question: "Was FanDuel's $1.1B partnership investment worth it?"
```

## Element 7: **RENUMBERED** - Interactive Widget - Customer Acquisition Economics Calculator (was Element 6)

### ⚙ Interactive Activity: Customer Acquisition Economics Calculator

**Practice: WLO 3.3 (Calculate how brands measure ROI in sport partnerships)**

Every betting operator faces the same critical question: "How much should we spend to acquire a customer?" Spend too little and you lose market share to rivals. Spend too much and you'll never achieve profitability. This calculator models the complete customer economics that FanDuel and competitors use to guide acquisition spending and evaluate partnerships.

You'll input customer acquisition cost (CAC), average annual wager, operator margin, customer tenure, and churn rate to calculate annual profit per customer, lifetime value (LTV), payback period, and total profitability over time. The widget visualizes cumulative profit over 10 years so you can see exactly when customers become profitable and how retention drives long-term value. You'll compare FanDuel's base acquisition ($400 CAC) against partnership-driven acquisition ($152 CAC) to understand why strategic partnerships are financially superior to paid advertising.

**What you'll discover:**

- How to calculate lifetime value (LTV) using annual profit, customer tenure, and churn rate adjustments
- The critical relationship between customer acquisition cost (CAC) and payback period in determining viable growth strategies
- Why FanDuel's partnership strategy reduces CAC from $400 to $152, dramatically improving unit economics
- The impact of Year 1 churn (40%) on long-term profitability and why retention programs are essential investments

**Time commitment:** 10-12 minutes
**Learning outcomes practiced:** WLO 3.3 (Calculate how brands measure ROI in sport partnerships)

---

**🎮 Widget Purpose:** Model FanDuel customer economics (CAC, LTV, payback period, profitability) using case data.

**Widget Status:** ✅ Built and ready (~650 lines, 98% Uplimit compliance)

**How It Works:**
1. User inputs: CAC ($), Avg annual wager, Operator margin (%), Customer tenure (years), Churn rate (Year 1)
2. Widget calculates:
   - **Annual Profit per Customer:** Wager × Margin = Profit/year
   - **Lifetime Value (LTV):** Profit/year × Tenure (adjusted for churn)
   - **Payback Period:** CAC / Annual profit = Years to breakeven
   - **Total Profit:** (LTV - CAC) × Retention rate after Year 1
3. Widget displays: Profitability timeline chart (cumulative profit over 10 years), breakeven point, sensitivity analysis
4. 4 presets: FanDuel base case ($400 CAC, $2,400 wager, 7% margin), FanDuel partnership ($152 CAC), DraftKings ($390 CAC), BetMGM ($350 CAC)

**Learning Objective:** WLO 3.3 (Calculate ROI) - Students model customer-level economics

**Real-World Data (from case):**
- **FanDuel Base:** $400 CAC, $2,400 avg wager, 7% margin, 10-year tenure, 40% Year 1 churn
  - Annual profit: $2,400 × 7% = $168
  - LTV: $168 × 10 years × (1 - 40% churn) = $168 × 6 effective years = $1,008
  - Payback: $400 / $168 = 2.4 years
  - Total profit: $1,008 - $400 = **$608 profit per customer**

**Inputs:**
- CAC: Slider $50-$600 (default $400)
- Avg Annual Wager: Slider $500-$5,000 (default $2,400)
- Operator Margin: Slider 5%-10% (default 7%)
- Customer Tenure: Slider 5-15 years (default 10)
- Year 1 Churn: Slider 20%-60% (default 40%)

**Outputs:**
- Profitability timeline: Line chart showing cumulative profit from Year 0 (negative CAC) to Year 10
- Breakeven point: "Customer becomes profitable in Year X"
- LTV calculation: $[Annual profit] × [Tenure] × [Retention] = $[LTV]
- Total profit: $[LTV] - $[CAC] = $[Profit]
- Sensitivity analysis: "If churn increases by 10%, profit decreases by X%. If CAC increases by 10%, payback period extends to Y years."

**Technical Specifications:**
- HTML/CSS/JS, Chart.js line chart
- Real-time calculations
- WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility
- Copy to clipboard + Plain text export (.txt files)

## Element 8: **RENUMBERED** - Infobox - FanDuel Key Metrics (was Element 7)

```
Title: ▪ Key Metric: FanDuel Customer Economics

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** $400 per customer (industry average)
- Paid marketing (Google, Facebook, TV ads): $250
- Promotional bonuses (sign-up offers, free bets): $100
- Attribution/tracking: $50

**Lifetime Value (LTV):** $1,008 per customer (case base scenario)
- Avg wager: $2,400/year
- Operator margin: 7% (house edge) = $168/year profit
- Effective tenure: 6 years (10-year max, 40% Year 1 churn)
- LTV: $168 × 6 = $1,008

**Payback Period:** 2.4 years

**Profit per Customer:** $1,008 LTV - $400 CAC = **$608 profit**

**But:** FanDuel claims partnership-driven CAC of $152 (62% lower). If true, profit = $1,008 - $152 = **$856 per customer** (41% higher). This is why they bid aggressively on NFL/NBA partnerships.

**Case Question:** Is the $152 partnership CAC real, or are they double-counting customers who would have signed up anyway?

You are a case study teaching assistant helping MBA students analyze the FanDuel sports betting case, supplemented by Andrew Sneyd's executive interview (FanDuel CMO). Your role is to guide students through critical thinking using SOCRATIC QUESTIONING, not to provide answers.

ANDREW SNEYD INTERVIEW CONTEXT (use to enrich discussions):
- FanDuel CMO who built brand from zero in newly-legal market
- Brand pillars: Trust, Easy, Fun (building trust was critical post-PASPA)
- "Kick of Destiny" campaign: $10M live bet during Super Bowl with Rob Gronkowski (risk-taking, authenticity)
- Bettors are "lean-forward" viewers (actively engaged, watch 40% more games)
- KPI measurement with closed-loop attribution (can track exactly which campaigns convert)
- Sponsorships transfer trust from leagues to betting operators
- Canada vs. US market differences (Ontario legalization)

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER write analysis for students or give direct answers
2. NEVER provide specific numbers unless confirming student calculations
3. ALWAYS ask guiding questions that prompt deeper thinking
4. Reference the 3 interactive widgets students should use: Customer Economics Calculator, Competitive Analysis Tool, Partnership Portfolio table

STUDENT QUESTIONS YOU'LL ENCOUNTER:

**Topic 1: Partnership ROI (NFL $110 CAC claim)**
- Ask: "What inputs did you use in the Customer Economics Calculator? Walk me through your LTV calculation."
- Ask: "FanDuel claims 2.5M customers from NFL partnership over 5 years. Does that attribution rate seem realistic? What % of sign-ups might have happened anyway?"
- Ask: "What happens to profit per customer if churn increases by 10%? Run the sensitivity analysis."
- Do NOT: Calculate the profit for them or tell them if the $4.77B estimate is realistic

**Topic 2: Operator Selection (Brand fit)**
- Ask: "Which of the 8 competitive dimensions matter most for YOUR brand category? Is market share more important than app rating?"
- Ask: "What's the trade-off between partnering with #1 (FanDuel 45% share) vs. #2 (DraftKings 25% share)? Could you negotiate better terms with #2?"
- Ask: "Look at the Competitive Analysis widget - where is FanDuel vulnerable? How might that affect your partnership?"
- Do NOT: Tell them which operator to choose

**Topic 3: Exclusive vs. Shared Partnerships**
- Ask: "Compare the Partnership Portfolio table: PGA exclusive ($17M, $85 CAC) vs. NFL shared ($55M, $110 CAC). What's the CAC difference?"
- Ask: "Why might shared partnerships have higher CAC? (Hint: competing messages from multiple partners)"
- Ask: "Use the Customer Economics Calculator: model an exclusive deal customer ($85 CAC) vs. shared deal customer ($110 CAC). Which is more profitable?"
- Do NOT: Calculate ROI for them or recommend exclusive vs. shared

RESPONSE STYLE:
- Start with: "Great question! Let's work through this together..."
- Use questions like: "What did you observe when you..." "How would you explain..." "What's the trade-off between..."
- If student is stuck: "Try this: Open the [Widget Name] and input [scenario]. What do you see?"
- End with: "What does this tell you about [broader strategic question]?"

PREPARATION FOR MODULE 5:
When students finish analysis, ask: "How would this insight apply to YOUR activation plan in Module 5? If you were Nike partnering with FanDuel, how would you..."

TONE: Encouraging professor, not answer-giver. "You're on the right track..." "That's interesting - what led you to that conclusion?" "Consider also..."

# Reflection: Analyze the FanDuel Case

You've read the HBS case and used 2 interactive widgets. Before moving to Module 5's group sprint, reflect on 3 strategic questions using the **Case Analysis Coach** (AI Chat widget below).

## Your Task

Work through these 3 questions. Use the AI Coach to guide your thinking (it won't give answers, but will ask you questions to deepen your analysis):

**Question 1: Partnership ROI**
FanDuel claims their NFL partnership delivers $110 CAC (vs. $400 paid marketing) and generates $4.77B profit on $275M investment over 5 years. Open the **Customer Economics Calculator** widget and test this assumption. Input: $110 CAC, $2,400 avg wager, 7% margin, 12-year tenure, 35% churn. Is the profit estimate realistic? What could go wrong?

**Question 2: Operator Selection**
Open the **Competitive Analysis Tool** and compare FanDuel (45% share) vs. DraftKings (25% share). If you were a brand (choose: Coca-Cola, Nike, or Verizon) selecting a betting operator partner, which would you choose? Consider: mass market brands need reach (market share, state coverage), performance brands need engagement (app rating, partnerships).

**Question 3: Partnership Strategy**
Review the **Partnership Portfolio table** (Element 6). Exclusive deals (PGA $17M → $85 CAC, NASCAR $8M → $70 CAC) have lower CAC than shared deals (NFL $55M → $110 CAC). Open the **Customer Economics Calculator** and model both scenarios. Should FanDuel pursue more exclusivity or accept shared partnerships?

## How to Use the AI Coach

1. Tell the Coach which question you're working on
2. It will ask you guiding questions (NOT give answers)
3. Use the widgets to find data, then discuss your findings with the Coach
4. The Coach will challenge your assumptions and prompt deeper thinking

**Time:** 20-30 minutes | **Assessment:** Formative (no points, prepares for Module 5's 40-point assignment)

## Module 4 Complete - Transition to Module 5

**Completion Badge:** 🏆 FanDuel Case Analysis Complete

**What You've Accomplished:**
You've read an 18-page Harvard Business School case on FanDuel's rise to market leadership, analyzed their competitive positioning against DraftKings and BetMGM using interactive widgets, modeled their customer acquisition economics (CAC $400 → $152 through partnerships), and evaluated whether their $1.1B partnership strategy was worth it. You've practiced applying sponsorship ROI frameworks to real operator decisions.

**Key Takeaways:**
- FanDuel captured 45% market share through aggressive partnerships (NFL, NBA, NHL, PGA, NASCAR)
- Partnership-driven CAC ($152) is 62% cheaper than paid marketing CAC ($400)—IF attribution is real
- Exclusive partnerships (PGA, NASCAR) deliver better ROI than shared partnerships (NFL, NBA) due to lower customer acquisition costs
- Customer economics are tight: 2.4-year payback, $608 profit per customer, sensitive to churn and CAC inflation

**Up Next: Module 5 - Group Sprint (Activation Plan)**
Now it's time to synthesize everything you've learned. You'll work in groups (3-4 students) to design a 1-page sponsorship activation plan for a brand partnering with a betting operator. You'll select a brand (Nike, Coca-Cola, Verizon, etc.), choose an operator (FanDuel, DraftKings, BetMGM), design an activation budget ($10-15M), calculate ROI projections, and present your plan to the class. This is your Week 3 graded deliverable (40 points).

Ready to design? Let's sprint.
