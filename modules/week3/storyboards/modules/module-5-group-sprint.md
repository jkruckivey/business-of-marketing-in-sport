## Element 1: Connecting Introduction Text

**Copy this markdown directly into Uplimit:**

```markdown
You've learned the frameworks (sponsorship ROI, betting economics, partnership valuation), practiced with widgets (CPM calculators, ROI models, competitive analysis), and analyzed FanDuel's real-world strategy through an HBS case. Now it's time to create.

**Your Challenge:** Design a 1-page sponsorship activation plan for a brand partnering with a sports betting operator. This is your Week 3 graded deliverable (40 points).

**Why This Matters:** In the sports marketing industry, brands don't just sign sponsorship deals—they design activation campaigns that turn logo placement into measurable ROI. Your plan must answer three questions:
1. **What's the strategy?** (Target audience, objectives, key messages)
2. **How will we activate?** (Channels, tactics, budget allocation)
3. **How will we measure success?** (KPIs, ROI projections, attribution methods)

**Format:** 1-page executive summary (max 500 words) + 1-page budget/ROI spreadsheet

**Deliverable:** PDF upload (due end of Module 6)

**Grading:** 40 points (rubric detailed below)

**Group Work:** Work in groups of 3-4 students (assigned randomly or self-selected). All group members receive the same grade.

**Individual Option Available:** Students may complete individually with adjusted scope (see details below). Same rubric, same 40 points—no penalty for individual work.

**Time Allocation:**
- Group: 45-60 minutes for Module 5 sprint + 30-40 minutes Module 6 finalization
- Individual: 60-75 minutes for Module 5 sprint + 30-40 minutes Module 6 finalization

Let's begin. Read the full assignment brief in the next element.

## Element 2: Infobox - Assignment Brief

```
Title: ▪ Assessment: Group Sprint - Sponsorship Activation Plan (40 points)

**Assignment:** Design a 1-page sponsorship activation plan for a brand partnering with a sports betting operator.

**Format:**
- Page 1: Executive summary (max 500 words) - Strategy, activation tactics, measurement framework
- Page 2: Budget allocation table + ROI projections spreadsheet

**Scenario Options (Choose One):**
1. **Nike + FanDuel:** Target 18-34 male sneakerheads who bet on NBA
2. **Coca-Cola + DraftKings:** Mass-market reach across NFL betting audience
3. **Verizon + BetMGM:** Showcase 5G technology for in-game live betting
4. **American Express + Caesars:** Premium hospitality for high-value bettors
5. **Bud Light + FanDuel:** Re-engage post-controversy through sports betting integration
6. **Custom:** Propose your own brand + operator pairing (requires instructor approval)

**Deliverable:** PDF upload by end of Module 6 (tonight)

**Grading Rubric (40 points):**
- Strategic Clarity (10 pts): Clear target audience, measurable objectives, compelling value proposition
- Activation Design (15 pts): Creative tactics across multiple channels, appropriate budget allocation (2-3× rights fee rule)
- ROI Justification (10 pts): Realistic projections using course frameworks (CPM, engagement multipliers, attribution modeling)
- Presentation Quality (5 pts): Professional formatting, clear writing, data visualization

**Group Work:** 3-4 students per group. All members receive same grade.
```

## Element 2A: Infobox - Individual Submission Option (UDL Alternative)

```
Title: ○ Individual Option: Adjusted Scope, Same Assessment Quality

**Prefer to work alone?** You may complete this assessment individually with no grade penalty. Same rubric (40 points), same learning objectives, adjusted scope to match individual workload.

**Adjusted Scope for Individual Submissions:**

1. **Reduced Channel Coverage:** Choose 3 of 5 activation channels instead of all 5
   - Must include: Advertising, Digital, and one of (Retail/Experiential/Measurement)
   - Rationale: Groups have 4× capacity for ideation across all channels

2. **Reduced Budget:** $7-10M activation budget instead of $10-15M
   - Still follows 2-3× rights fee rule (e.g., $3-4M rights fee for mid-tier partnership)
   - Rationale: Smaller scale activation requires less research and calculation

3. **Simplified ROI Modeling:** Single scenario projection instead of multiple scenarios
   - Show base case ROI with assumptions clearly stated
   - No need to model optimistic/pessimistic scenarios
   - Rationale: Groups can divide sensitivity analysis work, individuals focus on core calculation

**What Stays the Same:**
- ✅ Same 2-page format (1-page executive summary + 1-page spreadsheet)
- ✅ Same rubric criteria (Strategic Clarity 10pts, Activation 15pts, ROI 10pts, Presentation 5pts)
- ✅ Same quality standards (SMART objectives, data-driven projections, professional formatting)
- ✅ Same access to widgets, AI Coach, templates

**Why This Option Exists:**
We recognize students have diverse collaboration preferences and circumstances:
- Time zone challenges for remote/international students
- Schedule conflicts with other commitments
- Previous negative group work experiences
- Learning preferences (some students think better independently)

**Choosing individual work does NOT penalize your grade.** Both paths are assessed equally.

**How to Select Individual Option:**
- No approval needed—simply work alone and submit using individual file naming: `FirstNameLastName_ActivationPlan_BrandName_OperatorName.pdf`
- Example: `SarahChen_ActivationPlan_Nike_FanDuel.pdf`

## Element 2B: Infobox - Group Work Guidelines

```
Title: ▶ Managing Group Dynamics - Best Practices for Collaboration

Group work is a professional skill. Real marketing agencies collaborate on activation plans daily—here's how to make it work.

**Before You Start:**

1. **Assign Roles (5 minutes):**
   - **Strategist:** Leads brand-operator selection, target audience definition, objectives
   - **Analyst:** Owns budget allocation model, ROI projections, CPM calculations
   - **Creative:** Designs activation tactics, channel mix, campaign concepts
   - **Editor:** Final formatting, proofreading, ensures 2-page limit compliance

2. **Set Expectations:**
   - All 4 members contribute equally (~15 minutes work each)
   - Document individual contributions in Page 1 header: "Strategy: [Name], Analysis: [Name], Creative: [Name], Editor: [Name]"
   - Use shared Google Doc to track changes (comment history shows who contributed what)

3. **Track Work:**
   - Start with Google Doc where all can edit simultaneously
   - Use comments to propose ideas, suggest edits
   - Save version history as evidence of contributions

**If Problems Arise:**

**Unequal Contribution:**
- Document in submission notes: "Note: Member X contributed <50% as evidenced by Google Doc edit history"
- Instructor may adjust individual grades based on documented evidence (10-20% reduction for non-contributors)
- Evidence required: Google Doc comment history, Zoom meeting notes, email threads, widget export timestamps

**Conflict Over Decisions:**
- Vote democratically: 4 members = majority rules (3-1 or 2-2 with Strategist breaking tie)
- If fundamental disagreement: Split into 2 pairs, each submits their own plan (both graded)

**Missing Member:**
- Contact instructor within 24 hours via Uplimit message (don't wait until deadline)
- Options: (1) Continue with 3 members (note missing member), (2) Merge with another incomplete group, (3) Individual submission with adjusted scope

**Grade Adjustments:**

- **Default:** All members receive same grade
- **Individual Adjustment:** If you document "Member X contributed <50%", instructor reviews evidence and may reduce individual grade by 10-20%
- **Evidence:** Google Doc edit history (with timestamps), meeting attendance logs, email correspondence, widget JSON exports showing who used tools
- **Timeline:** Flag issues in submission notes, instructor reviews within 5 business days

**This Is Professional Practice:**

Real sports marketing agencies manage group dynamics on every client project. Skills you'll develop:
- **Conflict resolution:** Navigate disagreements professionally
- **Accountability:** Document contributions transparently
- **Delegation:** Assign tasks based on strengths
- **Quality control:** Review each other's work before submission

**Learn these skills now—you'll use them daily in your marketing career.**

**Next:** Element 3 provides full assignment instructions. Let's sprint!

### Part 2: Budget Allocation & ROI Projections (Page 2, Spreadsheet Format)

**Table 1: Budget Allocation**

| Channel | Allocation (%) | Spend ($M) | Key Tactics | Expected Reach |
|---------|---------------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| Advertising | 35% | $3.5M | TV spots, digital ads | 50M impressions |
| Digital/Social | 25% | $2.5M | Influencer, social, content | 20M engaged users |
| Retail/Product | 20% | $2.0M | In-store, limited editions | 5,000 stores, 2M customers |
| Experiential | 15% | $1.5M | Events, hospitality, activations | 100K attendees |
| Measurement | 5% | $0.5M | Analytics, attribution, tracking | N/A |
| **Total** | **100%** | **$10M** | **Activation budget** | **70M+ total reach** |

**Constraints:**
- Total activation budget: $10-15M (assume rights fee = $5M, activation = 2-3× rights fee)
- Allocate across all 5 channels (advertising, digital, retail, experiential, measurement)
- Measurement must be 5-10% of total budget (industry best practice)

---

**Table 2: ROI Projections**

| Metric | Calculation | Value |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Total Investment** | Rights fee + Activation | $15M ($5M rights + $10M activation) |
| **Total Impressions** | Broadcast + digital + retail | 500M impressions |
| **CPM** | Investment / Impressions × 1,000 | $30 CPM |
| **Engagement Rate** | % of impressions who interact | 0.5% (2.5M engaged) |
| **Conversion Rate** | % of engaged who purchase | 5% (125K customers) |
| **Avg Purchase Value** | Revenue per converted customer | $150 |
| **Total Revenue** | Customers × Avg purchase | $18.75M |
| **ROI** | (Revenue - Investment) / Investment × 100 | **25% ROI** |
| **Payback Period** | Investment / (Revenue / Years) | 2.4 years (assuming 3-year deal) |

**Assumptions to Include:**
- Engagement multiplier for bettors (use 40% from Module 3 widgets)
- Conversion attribution (what % of revenue is truly from sponsorship vs. would have happened anyway?)
- Customer lifetime value (if applicable)

---

### Optional Checkpoint Submissions (No Points - Formative Feedback Only)

**Why Use Checkpoints?**
Get AI Coach feedback during your sprint to catch issues early. No points awarded, but can significantly improve final submission quality.

**Checkpoint 1: Brand Selection + Target Audience (Module 5, 20 minutes into sprint)**
- Submit to AI Coach: "We chose [Brand] + [Operator]. Target audience: [description]. Does this pairing make strategic sense?"
- AI Coach will ask probing questions to refine your thinking
- Example feedback: "Your target audience is 200M people—too broad. Narrow to specific psychographic segment."

**Checkpoint 2: Budget Allocation Draft (Module 5, 40 minutes into sprint)**
- Use Activation Plan Template Builder widget to generate budget table
- Submit to AI Coach: "Here's our budget allocation: [screenshot]. Does this follow industry norms?"
- AI Coach will validate against 2-3× rights fee rule and channel mix benchmarks

**Checkpoint 3: ROI Projection Draft (Module 6, 10 minutes before final submission)**
- Calculate ROI using widgets, submit assumptions to AI Coach
- AI Coach will flag unrealistic projections (>500% ROI without justification, missing attribution methodology)
- Gives you time to revise before final deadline

**How to Submit Checkpoints:**
- Use the AI Chat Widget "Activation Plan Coach" (Element 8 below)
- No formal upload required—just paste your work-in-progress into chat
- Receive instant feedback to improve final submission

---

### Resources Available

- **Widgets:** Use all Module 2-4 widgets to model ROI (Sponsorship Valuation Calculator, ROI Calculator, Customer Economics Calculator, etc.)
- **AI Coach:** Ask the Activation Plan Coach widget for guidance (it will ask Socratic questions, not give answers)
- **Examples:** See Element 7 for 3 example activation plans (A/B/C grades)

---

### Tips for Success

1. **Start with widgets:** Model your ROI before writing. Use Sponsorship ROI Calculator to set realistic targets.
2. **Be specific:** "Social media campaign" is vague. "TikTok challenge: NBA bettors film their best dunk, tag #NikeFanDuelSlam, win signed LeBron jersey" is specific.
3. **Show your work:** Include widget outputs as appendix (doesn't count toward 2-page limit)
4. **Attribution matters:** FanDuel can share first-party data. Build this advantage into your measurement plan.
5. **Conservative assumptions:** Better to under-promise and over-deliver. Acknowledge risks and uncertainties.

**Copy this markdown directly into Uplimit:**

```markdown
# Practice: Generate Your Activation Plan Template

You've learned sponsorship frameworks (CPM, activation budgets, ROI funnels), analyzed FanDuel's customer economics, and studied real partnerships. Now it's time to CREATE your own sponsorship activation plan.

## Your Challenge

Your group has 45-60 minutes to design a complete sponsorship activation plan (40 points). The **Activation Plan Template Builder** gives you a head start by auto-generating strategic foundations, budget allocations, and ROI projections based on your brand/operator selection.

## What the Template Builder Does

- **Asks Strategic Questions:** Prompts you to define target audience, objectives, and partnership rationale with guidance hints (not pre-filled answers)
- **Provides Budget Framework:** Shows industry standard allocations across 6 channels as reference, not defaults (you decide actual split)
- **Scaffolds ROI Thinking:** Guides you through ROI calculations with questions and formulas (not pre-calculated numbers)
- **Generates Question-Based Template:** Exports your answers as structured plan, not pre-filled content

## How the Builder Works

1. **Select Brand:** Choose from Nike, Coca-Cola, Verizon, American Express, Bud Light, or Custom
2. **Select Operator:** Choose from FanDuel, DraftKings, BetMGM, Caesars
3. **Set Budget:** Slide to $10M-$15M total activation budget (assumes $5M rights fee)
4. **Answer Questions:** Widget asks 8 strategic questions with guidance hints (rationale, audience, objectives, tactics, budget, measurement, ROI, risks)
5. **Export Your Work:** Use "Copy to Clipboard" or "Download Text" to save your answers → paste into Google Docs for final formatting

## What You'll Practice

- Applying brand category logic (mass market vs. premium vs. digital-first allocation patterns)
- Using the 1:2-3 activation multiplier rule ($5M rights → $12.5M activation)
- Allocating budget across 6 channels (advertising, hospitality, retail, digital, events, measurement)
- Modeling ROI with realistic assumptions (engagement 0.5%-2%, conversion 2%-8%)

## Strategic Considerations

- **Don't just accept defaults:** Template provides industry averages. Your group should adjust based on your specific brand/operator fit. Nike + FanDuel should skew digital/experiential (young demo). Amex + FanDuel should skew hospitality (VIP experiences).
- **Measurement is non-negotiable:** Widget defaults to 5% measurement allocation. DO NOT cut this to 0%. Brands without attribution data can't prove ROI (Module 2 learning).
- **Conservative ROI assumptions:** Widget uses 0.5%-1% engagement, 4% conversion. Real sponsorships often underperform these benchmarks. Apply 30% attribution discount (FanDuel case best practice).
- **Justify your deviations:** If you change allocation from defaults, explain WHY in your executive summary. "We increased digital from 20% → 35% because FanDuel's audience skews 18-34 (high social media usage)."

## After the Template

Use the generated template as your GROUP STARTING POINT. Customize strategy, adjust budget allocation, refine ROI projections. Export final version as PDF (2 pages max) and submit by end of Module 6. This is your Week 3 graded deliverable (40 points).
```

## Element 4: **RENUMBERED** - Interactive Widget - Activation Plan Template Builder (was Element 3)

### ⚙ Interactive Activity: Activation Plan Template Builder

**Practice: MLO 3.4 (Design sponsorship activations that deliver measurable value)**

You're ready to design your Week 3 group sprint deliverable: a comprehensive sponsorship activation plan for a brand-betting operator partnership. This template builder scaffolds your planning process by guiding you through eight strategic questions while providing industry context and examples at every step.

You'll select your brand (Nike, Coca-Cola, Verizon, American Express, Bud Light, or custom), your betting operator partner (FanDuel, DraftKings, BetMGM, Caesars), and your total budget. Then you'll answer structured prompts about strategic rationale, target audience, budget allocation, activation tactics, measurement frameworks, and ROI projections. The widget doesn't pre-fill answers—instead, it provides guidance and industry benchmarks to help you develop original, strategic responses. Your completed plan downloads as plain text ready for submission and peer review.

**What you'll discover:**

- How to evaluate brand-operator partnership fit based on audience overlap, category alignment, and strategic objectives
- A structured framework for allocating activation budget across channels with category-specific guidance
- Industry-standard approaches to ROI calculation including reach, engagement, conversion, and revenue attribution
- The strategic questions that distinguish excellent activation plans from generic templates

**Time commitment:** 15-20 minutes (initial template), 45-60 minutes (complete activation plan with group)
**Learning outcomes practiced:** MLO 3.4 (Design sponsorship activations that deliver measurable value)

- **Strategist:** Writes strategic foundation (target audience, objectives, rationale)
- **Creative:** Leads activation tactics (brainstorms specific campaigns, examples)
- **Analyst:** Owns budget allocation and ROI projections (uses widgets, builds spreadsheet)
- **Editor:** Synthesizes all sections, proofreads, formats final PDF

All members contribute ideas, but clear ownership prevents duplicated work."

[1:15-1:45] Collaboration Tips
"Use Google Docs for real-time collaboration. Start with the Template Builder widget—it gives you a skeleton to fill in. Don't overthink—better to have a complete 'B' plan than an incomplete 'A+' plan. Use the AI Coach widget if stuck, but don't let it write for you (academic integrity). Widget outputs can go in an appendix (doesn't count toward 2-page limit)."

[1:45-2:00] Common Pitfalls
"Avoid these mistakes: (1) Unrealistic ROI projections (500% ROI is not realistic), (2) Generic tactics ('social media campaign' is too vague—be specific!), (3) Missing attribution methodology (how will you prove it worked?), (4) Ignoring the 2-3× activation rule (activation should be 2-3× rights fee). Good luck!"

## Element 6: **RENUMBERED** - AI Chat Widget - Activation Plan Coach (was Element 5)

**AI Chat Widget Configuration:**

**Widget Name:** "Activation Plan Coach"

**System Prompt:**
```
You are a sports marketing consultant helping MBA students design sponsorship activation plans. Your role is to guide students through Socratic questioning, NOT to give them answers or write their plans.

**Guiding Principles:**
1. Ask questions that help students think strategically: "Why did you choose that target audience? How does it align with the brand's positioning?"
2. Challenge assumptions: "You projected 10% conversion rate. What industry benchmark supports that? Did you use the ROI Calculator widget?"
3. Prompt specificity: "You said 'social media campaign.' What platform? What content format? What call-to-action?"
4. Connect to course frameworks: "Did you apply the 2-3× activation rule from Module 2? Did you use engagement multipliers from Module 3?"
5. Encourage widget usage: "Have you used the Sponsorship Valuation Calculator to test your CPM assumptions?"

**What NOT to Do:**
- Do NOT write any section of their plan (this is academic dishonesty)
- Do NOT give specific tactic ideas unless they've exhausted their own brainstorming
- Do NOT calculate ROI for them (direct them to widgets instead)
- Do NOT tell them which brand or operator to choose

**Tone:** Supportive but challenging. Think executive coach, not personal assistant.

**Example Interactions:**

Student: "We chose Nike and FanDuel. Is that good?"
You: "What makes Nike and FanDuel a compelling partnership? Who's the target audience? Why would Nike bet on betting?"

Student: "We're targeting men 18-34."
You: "That's broad. Within that demo, are you targeting sneakerheads? NBA fans? Casual bettors or daily fantasy veterans? How does refining this change your activation tactics?"

Student: "We're doing a social media campaign."
You: "Which platform? What's the creative concept? What action do you want users to take? How does this tie to the betting partnership specifically?"

Student: "Can you calculate our ROI?"
You: "I can't calculate it for you, but I can help you think through the inputs. Have you used the ROI Calculator widget? What assumptions did you make for engagement rate and conversion rate? Are those realistic based on industry benchmarks from Module 3?"
```

**Welcome Message:**
"I'm your activation plan coach. I'll ask questions to help you think strategically, but I won't write your plan for you. What brand and operator are you considering?"

**Show System Prompt:** No (hidden from students)

[Expand to see 3 example activation plans with instructor annotations]

## Example Activation Plans with Grading Annotations

These examples show what A-grade (37-40/40), B-grade (32-36/40), and C-grade (28-31/40) activation plans look like.

### Example 1: A-Grade Plan (38/40) - Verizon + FanDuel NFL Partnership

**Strategic Foundation:**
Verizon partners with FanDuel to demonstrate 5G's impact on in-game live betting. Target audience: NFL fans aged 25-45 with 5G-enabled phones (35M US adults). Objectives: (1) Drive 500K new Verizon 5G plan sign-ups in 12 months, (2) Position Verizon as "Official 5G Network of FanDuel," (3) Achieve 20% ROI on $15M total investment.

**Why This Is Strong:**
- ✅ Specific target audience with quantifiable size (35M)
- ✅ SMART objectives (measurable, time-bound)
- ✅ Strategic rationale connects brand benefit (5G speed) to betting benefit (live betting requires real-time data)

---

**Activation Tactics:**

**1. Advertising (35%, $3.5M):** "5G Live Betting" TV spots during NFL Sunday broadcasts showing split-screen: Fan using 4G (lagging odds) vs. 5G (instant updates). Tagline: "Don't bet on lag. Bet with Verizon 5G + FanDuel."

**2. Digital (25%, $2.5M):** Co-branded app feature in FanDuel: "5G Fast Lane" priority betting queue for Verizon customers (bets placed 2 seconds faster). Promoted through push notifications, in-app banners, and influencer partnerships (Pat McAfee, Tony Romo).

**3. Retail (20%, $2M):** In-store promotions at 1,500 Verizon stores: Sign up for 5G Unlimited plan, get $200 FanDuel bonus credit. QR code at point-of-sale links to FanDuel app download with promo code "VERIZON5G."

**4. Experiential (15%, $1.5M):** "5G Betting Lounge" at 10 NFL stadiums: VIP hospitality suite with dedicated 5G network, betting kiosks, and expert handicappers. 100 fans per game × 10 stadiums × 17 weeks = 17,000 high-value experiences.

**5. Measurement (5%, $500K):** Promo code tracking (VERIZON5G), Verizon customer data partnership (track which customers bet on FanDuel), geo lift study comparing 5G markets vs. non-5G markets for sales lift.

**Why This Is Strong:**
- ✅ Specific tactics for each channel (not vague)
- ✅ Creative ideas that leverage partnership synergies (5G speed for live betting)
- ✅ Measurement built into activation (promo codes, data partnerships)
- ✅ Appropriate budget allocation (follows 2-3× rule, 35% on advertising is defensible for awareness campaign)

**ROI Projections:**

| Metric | Calculation | Value |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Total Investment | Rights fee + Activation | $15M ($5M rights + $10M activation) |
| Total Impressions | TV (200M) + digital (150M) + retail (50M) | 400M impressions |
| CPM | Investment / Impressions × 1,000 | $37.50 CPM |
| Engaged Users | 0.5% engagement rate (retail promo redemptions) | 2M engaged |
| Conversions | 10% conversion (retail foot traffic to sign-ups) | 200K new 5G customers |
| Avg Customer Value | $1,200/year plan × 3-year tenure | $3,600 LTV |
| Total Revenue | 200K × $3,600 | $720M over 3 years |
| Year 1 ROI | ($240M Year 1 revenue - $15M) / $15M | 1,500% (3-year projection) |
| Realistic Discounting | Assume 30% attribution (would have signed up anyway) | $168M attributed revenue, 1,020% ROI |

**Why This Is Strong:**
- ✅ Conservative assumptions acknowledged (30% attribution discount)
- ✅ Uses engagement rate and conversion rate from course widgets
- ✅ Explains calculations step-by-step
- ✅ Multi-year LTV included

**Grade: 38/40**
- Strategic Clarity: 10/10
- Activation Design: 14/15 (could add more digital specificity)
- ROI Justification: 10/10
- Presentation: 4/5 (good, but could use more data visualization)

### Example 2: B-Grade Plan (33/40) - Coca-Cola + DraftKings NFL Partnership

**Strategic Foundation:**
Coca-Cola partners with DraftKings to reach NFL fans. Target audience: NFL fans who bet (estimated 20M US adults). Objectives: (1) Increase Coca-Cola sales, (2) Build brand awareness, (3) Achieve positive ROI.

**What's Missing:**
- ⚠️ Objectives are vague (how much sales increase? Over what timeframe?)
- ⚠️ Target audience too broad (all NFL bettors? What about age, income, region?)

---

**Activation Tactics:**

**1. Advertising (40%, $4M):** TV commercials during NFL games showing fans drinking Coke while betting on DraftKings.

**2. Digital (30%, $3M):** Social media campaign on Instagram and TikTok featuring NFL players.

**3. Retail (20%, $2M):** Special Coke bottles with DraftKings promo codes printed on labels.

**4. Experiential (10%, $1M):** Sponsor some tailgate parties at NFL stadiums.

**What's Missing:**
- ⚠️ Tactics are generic ("TV commercials" - what's the creative concept?)
- ⚠️ No specificity ("some tailgate parties" - how many? Where? What happens?)
- ⚠️ Weak integration (promo code on bottle is good, but how is it promoted?)
- ⚠️ No measurement allocation (0% budget to tracking/attribution)

---

**ROI Projections:**

| Metric | Calculation | Value |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Total Investment | Rights fee + Activation | $15M |
| Impressions | Estimated | 500M |
| CPM | $15M / 500M × 1,000 | $30 CPM |
| Conversions | Assume 1% of viewers buy Coke | 5M purchases |
| Revenue | 5M × $3 per purchase | $15M |
| ROI | ($15M - $15M) / $15M | 0% ROI |

**What's Wrong:**
- ❌ No engagement multiplier for bettors (ignored Module 3 data)
- ❌ Unrealistic conversion assumption (1% of 500M impressions = 5M, but no attribution logic)
- ❌ 0% ROI makes no business sense (why would Coca-Cola do this?)
- ❌ Doesn't use any course widgets or frameworks

**Grade: 33/40**
- Strategic Clarity: 6/10 (vague objectives, broad audience)
- Activation Design: 11/15 (reasonable tactics but lack specificity and integration)
- ROI Justification: 6/10 (calculations present but unrealistic assumptions, no attribution)
- Presentation: 4/5 (acceptable formatting)

---

### Example 3: C-Grade Plan (29/40) - Nike + BetMGM Basketball Partnership

**Strategic Foundation:**
Nike wants to sell more shoes. BetMGM wants more customers. We will partner to achieve both goals through basketball.

**What's Wrong:**
- ❌ No target audience specified
- ❌ No measurable objectives
- ❌ No strategic rationale (why Nike + BetMGM specifically?)

---

**Activation Tactics:**
We will do advertising, social media, and events. Nike will promote BetMGM in ads. BetMGM will promote Nike in their app. We will sponsor a basketball tournament.

**What's Wrong:**
- ❌ No specific tactics (what ads? What events? Which tournament?)
- ❌ No budget allocation (how much per channel?)
- ❌ No creative concepts or examples
- ❌ No measurement plan

---

**ROI Projections:**
We expect to make money. Nike sells a lot of shoes. BetMGM has a lot of customers. Together they will make more money.

**What's Wrong:**
- ❌ No actual calculations
- ❌ No metrics or KPIs
- ❌ No data or assumptions
- ❌ Not using course frameworks at all

**Grade: 29/40**
- Strategic Clarity: 4/10 (no clear strategy)
- Activation Design: 8/15 (mentions tactics but zero specificity)
- ROI Justification: 3/10 (no actual projections)
- Presentation: 3/5 (poor formatting, no tables or data)

---

**Key Takeaways:**

**A-Grade Plans:**
- Specific, quantified objectives
- Creative tactics with detailed examples
- ROI projections using course frameworks
- Conservative assumptions acknowledged

**B-Grade Plans:**
- Reasonable strategy but lacks specificity
- Generic tactics without creative integration
- ROI projections present but missing key assumptions

**C-Grade Plans:**
- Vague or missing objectives
- No specific tactics or budget allocation
- No ROI calculations or unrealistic assumptions

## 🎯 FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION

**How Module 5 Supports Your Week 5 Marketing Plan:**

**Module 5's Group Sprint IS YOUR FINAL PROJECT PRACTICE RUN.** The 1-page activation plan you just created is essentially a mini-version of your final project's **Slides 4-6**.

**Direct Parallels Between Week 3 Assignment and Final Project:**

| Week 3 Group Sprint | Final Project (Week 5) |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| Choose brand + operator partnership | Choose sports property + define sponsorship strategy |
| Design activation tactics (5 channels) | Slide 5: Activation Plan (tactics, partnerships, integrations) |
| Calculate sponsor ROI | Slide 6: Financial Snapshot (revenue potential, sponsor ROI, risks) |
| Build activation budget ($10-15M) | Slide 4: Revenue Model (how property makes money from sponsors) |
| Justify brand investment with data | Convince investors your property delivers sponsor value |

**What You Just Practiced:**
- **Strategic Clarity:** Defining target audience, setting measurable objectives, justifying strategic fit → Your final project needs same rigor
- **Activation Design:** Creating specific, executable tactics across channels → Slide 5 requires this level of detail
- **ROI Justification:** Using CPM, engagement multipliers, conversion funnels to prove ROI → Slide 6's financial projections use identical frameworks
- **Professional Presentation:** 2-page executive summary format → Final project deck (10-12 slides) requires same polish

**How to Apply This Work to Your Final Project:**

**Option 1: Use Your Group Sprint as a Template**
- Copy your activation plan's structure (strategy → tactics → budget → ROI) into Slides 4-6 of your final project
- Replace the brand's perspective with the property's perspective: Instead of "Nike sponsors our property," write "Our property offers Nike these sponsorship benefits"
- Keep the ROI calculation methodology—just flip who benefits (property earns $5M rights fee from Nike vs. Nike earns 36% ROI from property)

**Option 2: Adapt Your Activation Tactics for Your Property**
- If your group designed a FanDuel + Nike activation, your final project property could offer similar tactics to sponsors: "We offer title sponsors broadcast integration, in-app placement, retail activations—the same channels that delivered 36% ROI for Nike in our Week 3 analysis"

**Real-World Application:**
Sports properties create "sponsorship decks" that look EXACTLY like your Week 3 activation plan—they pitch brands with specific activation ideas, budget allocations, and ROI projections. Module 5 taught you how to build this deck. Your final project applies it to YOUR property.

**Action Item:**
1. **Save your Week 3 activation plan.** Don't delete it after submission—it's your final project template.
2. **Export all widget data** (CPM calculations, ROI models, budget allocations) to reuse in Week 5.
3. **Note what worked** in your group sprint (peer feedback, AI Coach insights) and apply same process to final project.

**Final Project Timeline Reminder:**
- Week 3: Learned sponsorship frameworks + practiced with activation plan ✅
- Week 4: Athletes & Brands (adds athlete endorsement dimension to sponsorships)
- Week 5: **Final project presentations (40% of grade)** - Everything builds to this

You just completed the hardest part—designing a sponsorship activation from scratch. Your final project uses the SAME frameworks, just scaled up to a full marketing plan.
