# Your Sponsorship Recommendation: The Strategy Memo

You've built powerful frameworks (sponsorship ROI, controversy-adjusted ROI, stakeholder analysis), practiced with interactive exercises (Brand Risk Calculator, Ethical Sponsorship Decision Tool), and wrestled with ethical complexity through the LIV Golf case and Phil Mickelson roleplay. Now it's time to synthesize everything into a professional deliverable.

**Your Challenge:** Write a 2-page sponsorship strategy memo advising a brand on whether to sponsor LIV Golf. This is your Week 3 graded deliverable (40 points).

**Why This Matters:** In sports marketing, executives don't want lengthy reports—they want clear, data-driven recommendations in memo format. Your memo must answer three questions:
1. **What's the recommendation?** (Sponsor or decline? Why?)
2. **What's the evidence?** (ROI projections, controversy-adjusted analysis, stakeholder impact)
3. **What are the trade-offs?** (What you gain vs. what you risk)

**Connection to Your CFL Project:** This memo is practice for your CFL Expansion Anchor Project. Here, you'll advise a brand on LIV Golf; in your CFL milestone, you'll apply these same skills to design a sponsorship strategy for YOUR city. Master the frameworks now—you'll use them again.

**Format:** 2-page executive memo (max 800 words) including data tables and recommendation

**Deliverable:** PDF upload (due end of Week 3)

**Grading:** 40 points (rubric detailed below)

**Individual Work:** This is an individual assignment. You'll apply your personal analysis and ethical framework to make a defensible recommendation.

**Time Allocation:** 60-75 minutes for memo development + 30-40 minutes for finalization

Let's begin. Read the full assignment brief in the next element.

## Sponsorship Strategy Memo Assignment (40 Points)

### Connection to Your CFL Project
This memo is deliberate practice. Here, you'll advise a brand on LIV Golf—applying the ethical sponsorship framework, stakeholder analysis, and controversy-adjusted ROI you've learned this week. In your CFL milestone, you'll flip perspectives: instead of advising a brand, you'll BE the sports property (your CFL team) designing a sponsorship strategy to attract brands. Same frameworks, different vantage point.

### Part 1: Executive Recommendation (Page 1, Max 500 Words)

**Section A: Recommendation & Rationale (~150 words)**
1. **Clear Position:** State your recommendation in the first sentence (Sponsor LIV Golf / Decline / Conditional acceptance)
2. **Brand Context:** Why does this decision matter for this specific brand? (BMW's premium positioning, Mastercard's ESG commitments, Budweiser's mass-market exposure)
3. **Key Factors:** What 2-3 factors drove your recommendation? (stakeholder analysis, controversy-adjusted ROI, competitor positioning)

**Section B: Stakeholder Analysis (~150 words)**
Using your Ethical Sponsorship Decision Tool outputs:
1. **Stakeholder Impacts:** Summarize expected impact on each group (customers, employees, shareholders, media, advocacy groups)
2. **Weighting Rationale:** Why did you weight stakeholders as you did? (e.g., "BMW's premium customers are highly sensitive to ethical concerns, weighted at 35%")
3. **Critical Stakeholder:** Which stakeholder group most influenced your recommendation, and why?

**Section C: Trade-offs & Alternatives (~200 words)**
1. **What You Gain:** If recommending sponsorship—financial opportunity, competitive positioning, audience reach
2. **What You Risk:** Reputation damage, customer backlash, employee concerns, media scrutiny
3. **Alternative Considered:** What's the counterfactual? (e.g., "Instead of LIV Golf, BMW could increase PGA Tour investment by 20% for similar reach with lower risk")
4. **Conditions:** If conditional acceptance, what would need to change? (e.g., "Sponsor only if LIV Golf adds human rights provisions to athlete contracts")

### Part 2: Supporting Analysis (Page 2, Data Tables)

**Table 1: Stakeholder Impact Summary**
(From your Ethical Sponsorship Decision Tool)

| Stakeholder | Impact Rating (-2 to +2) | Weight (%) | Weighted Score | Key Concern/Benefit |
|-------------|--------------------------|------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Customers | [Your rating] | [Your %] | [Calculated] | [e.g., "38% say they'd avoid sportswashing brands"] |
| Employees | [Your rating] | [Your %] | [Calculated] | [e.g., "52% uncomfortable with LIV sponsorship"] |
| Shareholders | [Your rating] | [Your %] | [Calculated] | [e.g., "Lower CPM opportunity vs. reputation risk"] |
| Media | [Your rating] | [Your %] | [Calculated] | [e.g., "Negative coverage likely for 6-12 months"] |
| Advocacy Groups | [Your rating] | [Your %] | [Calculated] | [e.g., "Human rights groups will campaign against"] |
| **Total** | — | **100%** | **[Decision Score]** | **[Recommend/Decline threshold]** |

---

### Resources Available

- **Analysis Tools:** Use your Ethical Sponsorship Decision Tool and Brand Risk Calculator outputs directly in your memo
- **Case Data:** Reference the LIV Golf Sponsor Portfolio table (who signed vs. declined) and sportswashing statistics
- **AI Coach:** Ask the Strategy Memo Coach for guidance (it will ask Socratic questions, not give answers)
- **Examples:** See Element 6 for 3 example strategy memos (A/B/C grades)

---

### Tips for Success

1. **Lead with your recommendation:** Don't bury it. First sentence of Page 1 should state: "BMW should [sponsor/decline] LIV Golf because..."
2. **Use your exercise outputs:** Your Ethical Decision Tool and Brand Risk Calculator results ARE your analysis. Don't recreate from scratch—export and reference.
3. **Be brand-specific:** Generic analysis fails. "Premium brands face reputation risk" is weak. "BMW's customer base—educated, high-income, environmentally conscious—is 2.3× more likely to care about sportswashing (Morning Consult data)" is strong.
4. **Engage the nuance:** The best memos acknowledge counterarguments. "While declining protects reputation, BMW loses first-mover advantage if LIV Golf gains legitimacy post-merger."
5. **Show your math:** Include exercise outputs as appendix (doesn't count toward 2-page limit). Graders want to see your stakeholder weights and ROI assumptions.
6. **Think like an executive:** Executives want clarity, not hedging. Make a decision and defend it.

# Build Your Analysis: Two Tools for Your Memo

Your strategy memo requires quantified stakeholder analysis and controversy-adjusted ROI. Use the two tools below to generate the data for your memo.

## Tool 1: Ethical Sponsorship Decision Tool → Page 2, Table 1

Use this tool to complete stakeholder analysis for your chosen brand:

1. **Select your brand** (BMW, Mastercard, Budweiser, or Rolex)
2. **Adjust stakeholder weights** based on brand positioning:
   - Premium brands (BMW, Rolex): Weight customers and employees higher (reputation-sensitive)
   - Mass-market brands (Budweiser): Weight shareholders higher (volume-driven)
   - Financial services (Mastercard): Weight media and advocacy groups higher (regulatory scrutiny)
3. **Rate each stakeholder's expected reaction** to LIV Golf sponsorship
4. **Export your analysis** and paste the stakeholder table into Page 2 of your memo
5. **Explain your weighting rationale** in your Page 1 narrative

## Tool 2: Brand Risk Calculator → Page 2, Table 2

Use this tool to model controversy-adjusted ROI:

1. **Enter brand-specific inputs:**
   - Rights fee: Estimate $5-15M based on LIV Golf sponsor patterns
   - Boycott probability: Adjust based on your brand's customer sensitivity
   - Brand equity at risk: Higher for premium brands with more to lose
2. **Compare Raw ROI vs. Risk-Adjusted ROI** — this is the core of your analysis
3. **Note the breakeven** — at what controversy level does the deal become negative?
4. **Export your analysis** and include in Page 2

## Key Questions to Answer

Your memo should answer:
- Does the risk-adjusted ROI justify sponsorship for THIS brand?
- Which stakeholder group most influences the decision, and why?
- What would need to change for the opposite recommendation to make sense?

## Connection to CFL Project

This same analytical approach—stakeholder analysis + ROI modeling—is what you'll use in your CFL Expansion Milestone when designing sponsorship strategy for YOUR city. The difference: there, you're the property seeking sponsors, not the brand evaluating properties. Same frameworks, different vantage point.

**AI Chat Widget Configuration:**

**Widget Name:** "Strategy Memo Coach"

**System Prompt:**
```
You are a sports marketing consultant helping MBA students write sponsorship strategy memos advising brands on whether to sponsor LIV Golf. Your role is to guide students through Socratic questioning, NOT to give them answers or write their memos.

**Context:**
Students are writing a 2-page memo advising a brand (BMW, Mastercard, Budweiser, or Rolex) on whether to sponsor LIV Golf. They have access to the Ethical Sponsorship Decision Tool and Brand Risk Calculator and should use those outputs in their analysis.

**Guiding Principles:**
1. Ask questions that connect to their analysis: "What did your Ethical Decision Tool show for customer impact? How did you weight that stakeholder group?"
2. Challenge brand-specific thinking: "You're advising BMW. How does BMW's premium positioning affect tolerance for controversy compared to a mass-market brand like Budweiser?"
3. Push for specificity: "You say 'reputation risk.' Quantify it. What's your boycott probability estimate? What % of BMW customers care about sportswashing?"
4. Connect to case data: "Did you reference the LIV Golf sponsor table? Why did Rolex decline while 7UP signed? What does that pattern tell you about your brand?"
5. Ensure both-sides thinking: "You recommend declining. What's the strongest argument FOR sponsoring? How would you respond to a CEO who pushes back?"

**What NOT to Do:**
- Do NOT write any section of their memo (academic dishonesty)
- Do NOT tell them whether to recommend sponsorship or decline
- Do NOT provide stakeholder ratings or ROI calculations—direct them to exercises
- Do NOT validate their position without challenge—push them to engage counterarguments

**Tone:** Supportive but rigorous. Think executive coach who wants them to succeed but won't let them off easy.

**Example Interactions:**

Student: "I chose BMW and I think they should decline LIV Golf."
You: "Walk me through your reasoning. What did your stakeholder analysis show? Which group was most negative, and how did you weight them? What's the controversy-adjusted ROI?"

Student: "My risk-adjusted ROI is -15%."
You: "Interesting. What assumptions drove that? What's your boycott probability? Is that realistic for BMW's customer base? What would change if you assumed 5% instead of 15%?"

Student: "Employees would be upset."
You: "The case says 52% of employees would be uncomfortable. But is that the same for German automotive employees? How does BMW's corporate culture affect your weighting?"

Student: "I think sponsorship is unethical."
You: "That's a personal view, which is valid. But your memo needs to be business-focused. How do you translate 'unethical' into stakeholder impacts and ROI adjustments? What's the dollar value of ethical concerns for BMW?"
```

**Welcome Message:**
```
I'm your Strategy Memo Coach. I'll ask questions to strengthen your analysis, but I won't write your memo or tell you what to recommend.

**Where are you in the process?**
- Just starting? Tell me which brand you chose and your initial instinct.
- Working on analysis? Share your Ethical Decision Tool or Brand Risk Calculator outputs.
- Drafting your memo? Paste a section and I'll ask probing questions.

What brand are you advising on LIV Golf?

---

### Example 1: A-Grade Memo (38/40) - BMW + LIV Golf: DECLINE

**Page 1: Executive Recommendation**

**Recommendation:** BMW should decline LIV Golf sponsorship.

**Rationale:** BMW's premium positioning and ESG commitments create unacceptable stakeholder risk. While LIV Golf offers attractive CPM ($25 vs. PGA Tour's $40) and access to marquee golfers, our stakeholder analysis shows significant negative impacts across 4 of 5 stakeholder groups. BMW's customers—educated, high-income, environmentally conscious—are 2.3× more likely to care about sportswashing concerns (Morning Consult data). The controversy-adjusted ROI is -18%, making this a value-destroying investment.

**Key Decision Factors:**
1. Customer sensitivity: 38% say they'd avoid brands associated with sportswashing
2. Employee impact: German corporate culture emphasizes values alignment; 52% workforce discomfort
3. ESG commitments: BMW's sustainability messaging conflicts with Saudi human rights record
4. Competitor pattern: Rolex declined for "values alignment"—BMW is closer to Rolex than to 7UP

**Stakeholder Analysis Summary:**
Using Ethical Decision Tool with premium brand weighting: Customers (35%) rated -2, Employees (25%) rated -1.5, Shareholders (20%) rated +0.5, Media (15%) rated -1.5, Advocacy (5%) rated -2. Weighted decision score: -47 (Strong Decline threshold: <-20).

**Trade-offs:**
- **What BMW loses:** Lower CPM opportunity, access to Phil Mickelson/Dustin Johnson, first-mover advantage if LIV gains legitimacy
- **What BMW preserves:** Brand equity, ESG credibility, employee morale, customer trust
- **Alternative:** Increase PGA Tour "Elevated Events" sponsorship by 25% for comparable reach with established infrastructure and no controversy

**Why This Is Strong:**
- ✅ Clear recommendation in first sentence
- ✅ Brand-specific rationale (not generic)
- ✅ References case data (Rolex pattern, Morning Consult statistics)
- ✅ Quantified stakeholder analysis with weighting rationale
- ✅ Acknowledges trade-offs honestly

**Page 2: Supporting Analysis**

**Table 1: Stakeholder Impact (BMW)**

| Stakeholder | Impact | Weight | Score | Rationale |
|-------------|--------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Customers | -2 | 35% | -0.70 | Premium customers highly sensitive; 38% boycott risk |
| Employees | -1.5 | 25% | -0.38 | German corporate culture; recruitment impact |
| Shareholders | +0.5 | 20% | +0.10 | Lower CPM opportunity, but reputation risk outweighs |
| Media | -1.5 | 15% | -0.23 | Negative coverage likely for 12+ months |
| Advocacy | -2 | 5% | -0.10 | Human rights groups will campaign |
| **Total** | — | 100% | **-1.31** | **Score: -47 (Strong Decline)** |

**Table 2: Controversy-Adjusted ROI**

| Metric | Raw | Adjusted | Notes |
|--------|-----|----------|-------|
| Rights Fee | $10M | — | LIV Golf premium sponsor tier |
| Impressions | 300M | 250M | Reduced by 17% boycott avoidance |
| CPM | $33 | $40 | Adjusted for reduced reach |
| Raw ROI | +22% | — | Before controversy adjustment |
| Boycott Cost | — | $8M | 5% revenue × $160M golf segment |
| Employee Impact | — | $2M | Recruitment/retention costs |
| Brand Equity Risk | — | $15M | 10% of BMW's $150M golf marketing equity |
| **Risk-Adjusted ROI** | — | **-18%** | After $25M risk cost |
| **Breakeven** | — | 3% | Controversy would need to drop to 3% for positive ROI |

**Why This Is Strong:**
- ✅ Both tables complete with rationale
- ✅ Brand-specific inputs (not generic)
- ✅ Conservative assumptions stated
- ✅ Breakeven analysis included

**Grade: 38/40**
- Strategic Clarity: 10/10
- Analytical Rigor: 14/15
- Ethical Framework: 10/10
- Presentation: 4/5

---

### Example 2: B-Grade Memo (33/40) - Budweiser + LIV Golf: SPONSOR

**Page 1: Executive Recommendation**

**Recommendation:** Budweiser should sponsor LIV Golf.

**Rationale:** Budweiser's mass-market positioning means lower reputation sensitivity than premium brands. LIV Golf offers attractive CPM and access to golf demographics that align with Budweiser's target audience. While there are ethical concerns, Budweiser's customers are less likely to boycott compared to BMW or Mastercard customers.

**Stakeholder Analysis:** Customers rated neutral, employees slightly negative, shareholders positive due to ROI opportunity.

**Trade-offs:**
- Gain: Lower cost access to golf audience, differentiation from competitors
- Risk: Some reputation damage, but manageable for mass-market brand

**What's Partially Strong:**
- ✅ Clear recommendation stated
- ✅ Some brand-specific reasoning (mass-market vs. premium)
- ⚠️ Stakeholder analysis mentioned but not quantified
- ⚠️ No specific case data referenced

---

**Page 2: Supporting Analysis**

**Stakeholder Table:** [Provided but weights don't sum to 100%, ratings not justified]

**ROI Table:**
- Rights fee: $8M
- Raw ROI: +35%
- Risk-adjusted ROI: +15%
- [No calculation shown for how risk adjustment was derived]

**What's Missing:**
- ⚠️ Stakeholder weighting rationale absent
- ⚠️ ROI adjustment methodology unclear
- ⚠️ No reference to case data (why didn't existing beer brands sign?)
- ⚠️ Alternative not considered

**Grade: 33/40**
- Strategic Clarity: 8/10
- Analytical Rigor: 10/15
- Ethical Framework: 7/10
- Presentation: 4/5

---

### Example 3: C-Grade Memo (28/40) - Mastercard + LIV Golf: DECLINE

**Page 1: Executive Recommendation**

**Recommendation:** Mastercard should not sponsor LIV Golf because sportswashing is bad.

LIV Golf is funded by Saudi Arabia which has human rights problems. Mastercard should not be associated with this. It would hurt their reputation.

**What's Wrong:**
- ❌ Personal ethics statement, not business analysis
- ❌ No stakeholder analysis
- ❌ No brand-specific context (why Mastercard specifically?)
- ❌ No quantification of "hurt reputation"

---

**Page 2: Supporting Analysis**

"I think the ROI would be negative because of reputation damage. Mastercard customers care about ethics."

[No tables provided]

**What's Wrong:**
- ❌ No actual calculations
- ❌ No use of course exercises

## What's Next

**What You've Accomplished:**
You've received the strategy memo assignment (40 points), reviewed full instructions and rubric, and have access to the analysis tools. You should now be drafting your 2-page sponsorship strategy memo advising your chosen brand on LIV Golf.

**Time Check:**
If you've completed your memo draft, move to the assessment section for finalization and submission. If you need more time, use the Strategy Memo Coach for guidance (Socratic questions, not answers).

**Connection to CFL Project:**
Remember: this memo practices the analytical skills you'll apply in your CFL milestone. There, you'll flip perspectives—instead of advising a brand, you'll BE the sports property (your CFL team) designing sponsorship strategy to attract brands. Same frameworks, different vantage point.
