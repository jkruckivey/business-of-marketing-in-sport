- ✅ Apply points (40 points total)

---

**CRITERION 1: Strategic Clarity (10 points)**

**Description:**
Clear recommendation with brand-specific rationale, supported by case data and stakeholder considerations.

**Does not meet expectations (0-6 points):**
Recommendation unclear or buried in text. Generic analysis that could apply to any brand (doesn't address BMW vs. Budweiser positioning differences). Fewer than 2 key decision factors identified. No reference to LIV Golf case data from Module 4.

**Partially meets expectations (7-8 points):**
- 7 pts: Clear recommendation stated, but rationale is generic or doesn't connect to specific brand positioning
- 8 pts: Clear recommendation with brand-specific rationale, but missing connection to Module 4 case data (e.g., doesn't reference LIV Golf sponsor patterns, sportswashing statistics)

**Fully meets expectations (9-10 points):**
- 9 pts: Clear recommendation in first sentence, brand-specific rationale citing positioning/ESG/audience fit, 3+ decision factors with evidence from stakeholder analysis
- 10 pts: Above PLUS references specific Module 4 content (e.g., "BMW's premium positioning mirrors Rolex, who declined LIV Golf for 'values alignment' concerns" or "38% boycott likelihood from sportswashing research")

---

**CRITERION 2: Analytical Rigor (15 points)**

**Description:**
Proper use of Module 4 exercises (Ethical Sponsorship Decision Tool, Brand Risk Calculator) with complete stakeholder and ROI analysis.

**Does not meet expectations (0-9 points):**
Missing stakeholder analysis OR missing ROI analysis. No evidence of using Module 4 exercises. Assumptions not stated. Tables incomplete or missing.

**Partially meets expectations (10-12 points):**
- 10 pts: Both tables present but incomplete (e.g., stakeholder weights don't sum to 100%, ROI calculation missing key inputs like boycott probability)
- 11 pts: Complete tables with reasonable inputs, but rationale for stakeholder weights or ROI assumptions is weak or missing
- 12 pts: Complete tables with stated rationale, uses Module 4 exercise outputs, but doesn't explicitly connect data to recommendation

**Fully meets expectations (13-15 points):**
- 13 pts: Complete stakeholder and ROI analysis with clear rationale, explicit connection between data and recommendation ("Decision score of -47 indicates Strong Decline")
- 14 pts: Above PLUS conservative assumptions acknowledged, breakeven analysis included ("Controversy would need to drop to 3% for positive ROI")
- 15 pts: Above PLUS references specific case data (e.g., "38% boycott likelihood from Module 4 sportswashing framework," "52% employee discomfort statistic," "Rolex declined for values alignment")

---

**CRITERION 3: Ethical Framework (10 points)**

**Description:**
Thoughtful application of Module 4 sportswashing framework with stakeholder weighting rationale appropriate to chosen brand.

**Does not meet expectations (0-6 points):**
No stakeholder analysis. Treats decision as purely financial ("ROI is positive so sponsor"). Ignores sportswashing dimension entirely. Personal opinion ("sportswashing is bad") without business analysis.

**Partially meets expectations (7-8 points):**
- 7 pts: Acknowledges ethical concerns but doesn't systematically analyze stakeholders. Uses generic stakeholder weights not tailored to brand.
- 8 pts: Uses stakeholder framework with brand-appropriate weights, but weighting rationale is weak or doesn't connect to brand positioning (e.g., doesn't explain WHY BMW customers weighted at 35%)

**Fully meets expectations (9-10 points):**
- 9 pts: Thoughtful stakeholder weighting with brand-specific rationale (e.g., "BMW weighted employees at 25% due to German corporate culture emphasis on workplace values" or "Budweiser weighted shareholders higher due to mass-market volume economics")
- 10 pts: Above PLUS engages with sportswashing debate nuance (e.g., "While sportswashing evidence is mixed—Saudi favorability +15% among sports fans—BMW's customer base skews educated and likely more aware of ethical concerns")

---

**CRITERION 4: Presentation Quality (5 points)**

**Description:**
Professional executive memo format with clear writing and effective data visualization.

**Does not meet expectations (0-3 points):**
Poor formatting (inconsistent fonts, unclear structure). Unclear or verbose writing. Missing data tables. Exceeds 2-page limit. Recommendation buried in middle of document.

**Partially meets expectations (4 points):**
Acceptable formatting and clear writing. Basic tables for stakeholder analysis and ROI present but may lack polish. Minor formatting inconsistencies.

**Fully meets expectations (5 points):**
Professional executive memo quality. Recommendation in first sentence. Polished formatting with consistent styling. Clear, concise writing appropriate for business audience. Well-formatted tables with headers and rationale columns. Stays within 2-page limit while including all required elements.

**Total Points:** 40

## Element 4: Details - AI Feedback Exercise (Optional)

```
Title: Optional: Get AI Feedback Before Submitting (1 Bonus Point)

[Expand for AI coaching instructions]

## Why Get AI Feedback?

Sports marketing professionals increasingly use AI tools for strategy development. This optional exercise helps you:
- Identify gaps in your analysis before final submission
- Practice evaluating AI suggestions critically
- Develop AI literacy for your career

**Time Investment:** 10-15 minutes
**Bonus Points:** 1 point for completing the reflection (Element 5)

---

## How to Get AI Feedback

**Step 1: Copy this prompt into ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini:**

```
You are a sports marketing consultant evaluating a 2-page sponsorship strategy memo for an MBA course. The assignment asks students to advise a brand (BMW, Mastercard, Budweiser, or Rolex) on whether to sponsor LIV Golf.

RUBRIC CRITERIA (40 points total):
1. Strategic Clarity (10 pts): Clear recommendation in first sentence with brand-specific rationale. References case data (LIV Golf sponsor patterns, sportswashing statistics).
2. Analytical Rigor (15 pts): Complete stakeholder impact table with weights summing to 100%. Controversy-adjusted ROI calculation with stated assumptions.
3. Ethical Framework (10 pts): Thoughtful stakeholder weighting appropriate to brand positioning. Engages with sportswashing nuance.
4. Presentation Quality (5 pts): Professional memo format, clear tables, within 2-page limit.

Please evaluate this strategy memo draft against these criteria:
- For each criterion, identify strengths and specific improvement suggestions
- Flag any missing elements (stakeholder table, ROI calculation, weighting rationale)
- Note if the analysis is brand-specific or too generic

Here is the strategy memo:

[PASTE YOUR DRAFT HERE]
```

**Step 2: Review the AI's feedback**
- Which suggestions are valid?
- Which suggestions misunderstand the assignment or brand context?
- What would you change based on the feedback?

**Step 3: Complete the AI Feedback Reflection (Element 5)**
- Submit a brief reflection on what you learned
- Earns 1 bonus point

---

## Important Notes

- AI feedback is **optional** - you can submit your memo without it
- AI suggestions are not always correct - evaluate critically
- The AI doesn't have access to Module 4 case data, so it may miss context
- You decide what to change - maintain strategic ownership

---

## Tips for Using AI Feedback Effectively

**Good uses of AI feedback:**
- Catch formatting issues or unclear writing
- Identify missing elements (e.g., "You didn't include breakeven analysis")
- Challenge assumptions ("Your 5% boycott probability seems low for BMW's customer base")

**Limitations of AI feedback:**
- Can't evaluate brand fit as well as someone who knows the case
- May suggest generic improvements that don't apply to sportswashing context
- Doesn't know what you learned in Module 4 exercises

**Career Application:**
In sports marketing roles, you'll use AI tools for campaign planning, content creation, and ROI modeling. Learning to evaluate AI output critically—accepting valid suggestions, rejecting poor ones—is an essential professional skill.

```
[0:00-0:15] Week 3 Recap
"Congratulations on completing Week 3: Sponsorship, Betting & Ethical Complexity. You've learned how sponsors value partnerships, why betting operators pay premiums, and how to navigate ethically complex sponsorship decisions. Let's review the key takeaways."

[0:15-0:50] Week 3 Key Takeaways
"Three frameworks to remember:

1. **Sponsorship ROI:** Calculate CPM (rights fee divided by impressions times 1,000), allocate activation budget at 2-3× rights fee, measure through reach-engagement-conversion funnel.

2. **Betting Economics:** Bettors are the most valuable fans—40% more viewership, 3× digital engagement. Betting partnerships often command 20-30% premiums because they offer first-party data and closed-loop attribution.

3. **Ethical Framework:** Sponsorship decisions aren't just math. The LIV Golf case taught you to analyze stakeholder impacts, calculate controversy-adjusted ROI, and make defensible recommendations when values and profits conflict."

[0:50-1:20] Connection to CFL Project
"Next up in Module 7: Apply these frameworks to YOUR CFL expansion city. In Milestone 3, you'll design a sponsorship strategy—identifying target sponsors, setting pricing, and addressing any ethical considerations for your market.

The LIV Golf memo was practice advising a brand. Milestone 3 flips the perspective—you ARE the sports property attracting brands. Same frameworks, different vantage point."

[1:20-1:45] Week 4 Preview
"Week 4 shifts from team/league sponsorship to individual athletes and emerging sports. You'll learn:
- How athletes build personal brands (Serena Williams case study)
- Why women's sports sponsorship is the fastest-growing category
- How to evaluate emerging sports investments

**Before Week 4:** Access the Serena Williams case through HBS. Think about your favorite athlete—what brands do they endorse, and why?"

[1:45-2:00] Closing
"You've completed three weeks: Revenue Ecosystems, Media Rights, and now Sponsorship & Ethics. You have the analytical toolkit. Weeks 4 and 5 show you how to apply it to athletes, emerging markets, and your final CFL project. See you in Module 7 for Milestone 3, then Week 4!"
```

- Should brands sign athletes or sponsor leagues?

**Week 4 Preparation:**

## Instructor Notes

**Module 6 Teaching Goals:**
- Collect summative assessment (strategy memo)
- Provide opportunity for AI-assisted learning (optional)
