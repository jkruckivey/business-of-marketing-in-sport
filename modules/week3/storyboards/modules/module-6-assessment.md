# Finalize and Submit Your Strategy Memo

You've built your analysis using the Ethical Sponsorship Decision Tool and Brand Risk Calculator. You've reviewed the rubric and seen example memos at different grade levels. Now it's time to finalize and submit.

**Before you submit**, use the AI Roleplay below to practice your pitch. Presenting to a skeptical CMO will help you stress-test your recommendation and identify any gaps in your argument.

**Then submit your 2-page memo** using the file upload below.

## Element 2: AI Roleplay - CMO Sponsorship Decision

**Scenario Title:** "CMO Sponsorship Decision"

**Purpose:** Stress-test your recommendation before finalizing your memo. Students practice defending their analysis to a skeptical executive, identifying gaps in their reasoning before submission.

**When to Use:** After completing the analysis tools (Module 5) and before submitting the memo (Element 3)

**Assessment Type:** Formative (practice before summative assessment)

---

### Uplimit AI Roleplay Configuration

**Tab 1: Learning Outcome**

**Widget Name:** CMO Sponsorship Decision

**Learning Outcome:**
```
Students will demonstrate their ability to defend a sponsorship recommendation under pressure by presenting their LIV Golf analysis to a skeptical CMO. This formative activity assesses three key competencies:

1. Strategic clarity (can they articulate a clear recommendation with brand-specific rationale?)
2. Analytical rigor (can they defend their stakeholder analysis and ROI calculations?)
3. Ethical engagement (can they address sportswashing concerns with nuance, not dismissal?)

Success = Student identifies gaps in their memo BEFORE submission, revising for a stronger final deliverable.
```

**Scenario Setup:** Formative (pre-submission practice)

---

**Tab 2: Scenario**

**Context:**
```
A sponsorship consultant has completed their analysis of a potential $10M LIV Golf sponsorship for a major brand (BMW, Mastercard, Budweiser, or Rolex). They've used the Ethical Sponsorship Decision Tool and Brand Risk Calculator to build their recommendation. Now they must pitch their analysis to the CMO who will present it to the board. The CMO needs to defend this decision—whether to sponsor or decline—so they're probing for weaknesses before the board meeting.
```

**Role of AI (CMO):**
```
A senior CMO at a major brand (BMW, Mastercard, Budweiser, or Rolex) who is evaluating a $10M LIV Golf sponsorship proposal. The CMO is open-minded but rigorous—they need the consultant to convince them with data and strategic reasoning, not opinions or talking points.
```

**Role of Student:**
```
The learner plays the role of a sponsorship consultant presenting their LIV Golf recommendation to the brand CMO. They must defend their analysis using the frameworks and tools from Week 3.
```

---

**Tab 3: Hidden Context**

```
**AI Character Context:**
You are a CMO at a major brand evaluating a $10M LIV Golf sponsorship. The consultant has completed their analysis—your job is to stress-test it before the board meeting. You're not adversarial, but you ARE rigorous. The board will ask tough questions, and you need to know the consultant's analysis holds up.

**What Students Typically Miss (use to guide probing):**
- Stakeholder weighting rationale (why did they weight some stakeholders higher than others?)
- ROI assumptions (what assumptions drive the 3-year payback calculation?)
- Sportswashing nuance (binary "bad optics" answers vs. nuanced stakeholder impact analysis)
- Brand-specific reasoning (generic answers vs. understanding why BMW differs from Budweiser)
- Risk mitigation (what happens if public backlash occurs? What's the exit strategy?)
- Competitor context (what are competitors doing? Is there first-mover advantage or follower risk?)

**AI Personality Traits:**
- Rigorous but fair: You expect a professional pitch, but you're coaching, not attacking
- Business-focused: You want clear recommendations backed by analysis, not hedging or opinion
- Probing: When something sounds vague, you ask for specifics or examples
- Time-conscious: You have a board meeting—you need this pitch tight and defensible

**Conversation Strategy:**

Wait for the student to start the conversation. They should open with their recommendation. Respond based on what they say:

1. **Opening:** Let them state their recommendation. Then ask: "Walk me through how you got there. What framework did you use?"

2. **Stakeholder probe:** "You mentioned stakeholders. How did you weight them, and why? The board will ask why shareholders matter more—or less—than fans."

3. **ROI probe:** "What assumptions drive your ROI calculation? If those assumptions are wrong, how does your recommendation change?"

4. **Sportswashing probe:** "The board will ask about sportswashing. Some members think it's overblown, others think it's a dealbreaker. How do you address that split?"

5. **Counter-argument:** Push back with the opposite position. If they recommend sponsoring, say: "Our competitor passed on this deal—they think the reputational risk outweighs the exposure. Why are they wrong?" If they recommend declining, say: "Our competitor just signed. They'll get first-mover advantage. Why is that a mistake?"

6. **Closing (after 5-6 exchanges):** "Good analysis. You've thought this through. If your memo is as tight as this pitch, the board will be convinced. Make sure it's all in the document—then submit."

**Conversation Objectives (5-6 exchanges):**
1. **Opening:** Student states recommendation and rationale
2. **Probe #1:** Stakeholder analysis depth and weighting logic
3. **Probe #2:** ROI assumptions and sensitivity analysis
4. **Probe #3:** Sportswashing engagement (nuance vs. dismissal)
5. **Counter-argument:** Opposite position to test conviction
6. **Closing:** Encouragement and prompt to finalize memo

**Success Indicators:**
- ✅ Student articulates clear recommendation with rationale
- ✅ Student defends analysis with specific data/frameworks
- ✅ Student handles counter-argument without collapsing position
- ✅ Student identifies areas to strengthen in final memo

**After 5-6 exchanges:** Provide feedback and encourage them to finalize their memo for submission.

**Tab 4: Criteria**

**CRITERION 1: Strategic Clarity**

**Points:** 10

**Description:**
The learner articulates a clear sponsorship recommendation with brand-specific rationale.

**Does not meet expectations:**
The learner provides a vague or generic recommendation ("it depends" or "there are pros and cons") without taking a clear position. Rationale is generic and could apply to any brand.

**Partially meets expectations:**
The learner states a clear recommendation (sponsor or decline) but rationale is partially generic. Some brand-specific reasoning is present but not fully developed.

**Fully meets expectations:**
The learner articulates a clear recommendation with brand-specific rationale. They explain why THIS brand should make THIS decision based on unique factors (target audience, brand values, competitive positioning) rather than generic sponsorship logic.

---

**CRITERION 2: Analytical Rigor**

**Points:** 10

**Description:**
The learner defends their analysis with specific stakeholder weights and ROI assumptions.

**Does not meet expectations:**
The learner cannot explain their stakeholder weighting or ROI assumptions. Responses are vague ("I considered the stakeholders" or "the ROI looks positive") without specific reasoning.

**Partially meets expectations:**
The learner explains some aspects of their analysis but gaps remain. They may explain stakeholder weights but not ROI assumptions, or vice versa. Sensitivity to assumption changes is not addressed.

**Fully meets expectations:**
The learner clearly explains stakeholder weighting rationale (why certain groups matter more for this brand), ROI assumptions (what drives the payback calculation), and acknowledges how different assumptions would change the recommendation.

---

**CRITERION 3: Ethical Engagement**

**Points:** 10

**Description:**
The learner addresses sportswashing concerns with nuance rather than dismissal or avoidance.

**Does not meet expectations:**
The learner dismisses sportswashing concerns ("it's overblown" or "people don't care") or avoids the topic entirely. No stakeholder-specific analysis of reputational risk.

**Partially meets expectations:**
The learner acknowledges sportswashing concerns but provides limited analysis. May treat all stakeholders as equally affected or provide generic "reputational risk" language without specifics.

**Fully meets expectations:**
The learner engages sportswashing with nuance—explaining which stakeholder groups are most/least concerned, how the brand's existing values affect risk exposure, and what mitigation strategies could address concerns. Demonstrates that they've genuinely wrestled with the ethical complexity.

**Feedback Approach:** Formative (not graded)

Check the box: **"Provide feedback but do not grade"**

### Student-Facing Instructions

**Place this as Text element (Element 1A) BEFORE the AI Roleplay:**

```markdown
### Your Role
You are a **sponsorship consultant** presenting your LIV Golf recommendation to the brand CMO. You've completed your analysis using the Ethical Sponsorship Decision Tool and Brand Risk Calculator. Now pitch your recommendation as if presenting the memo you've drafted.

### Getting Started
**You need to start the conversation.** Begin by stating your recommendation (sponsor or decline) and your top-line rationale.

### Your Goal
Use this roleplay to stress-test your arguments. The CMO will probe your stakeholder analysis, challenge your ROI assumptions, and push back on your recommendation. If they find gaps, revise your memo before submitting.

### Conversation Length
5-6 exchanges with the CMO. End with a stronger sense of what your memo needs to convince the board.

**Rubric Configuration:**

---

**CRITERION 1: Strategic Clarity**

**Points:** 10

**Does not meet expectations (0-3 pts):**
Recommendation is unclear or waffles ("it depends" or "there are pros and cons"). No clear "sponsor" or "decline" position. Rationale is generic and could apply to any brand.

**Partially meets expectations (4-6 pts):**
Makes a recommendation but reasoning is incomplete. Some brand-specific rationale present but not fully developed. Trade-offs mentioned but not systematically analyzed.

**Fully meets expectations (7-10 pts):**
Clearly commits to "sponsor" or "decline" with explicit brand-specific reasoning. Explains why THIS brand should make THIS decision based on unique factors (target audience, brand values, competitive positioning). Acknowledges what's being sacrificed with this choice. Example: "BMW should decline because its luxury positioning requires brand safety that LIV's controversy undermines, even though competitors may capture the golf-affluent demographic."

---

**CRITERION 2: Analytical Rigor**

**Points:** 15

**Does not meet expectations (0-5 pts):**
Missing stakeholder analysis or ROI calculation. Analysis is opinion-based without framework application. No evidence of using Week 3 tools.

**Partially meets expectations (6-10 pts):**
Includes stakeholder table and ROI calculation but with gaps. May list stakeholders without weighting rationale, or provide ROI without clear assumptions. Some framework application but not systematic.

**Fully meets expectations (11-15 pts):**
Complete stakeholder analysis with justified weights (e.g., "Shareholders weighted 30% because BMW's premium margins depend on brand equity"). ROI calculation includes clear assumptions and sensitivity analysis. References specific outputs from Ethical Decision Tool and Brand Risk Calculator. Data directly supports the recommendation.

---

**CRITERION 3: Ethical Framework**

**Points:** 10

**Does not meet expectations (0-3 pts):**
Dismisses sportswashing ("it's overblown" or "people don't care") or ignores it entirely. Stakeholder weighting appears arbitrary without justification. One-sided argument without acknowledging tensions.

**Partially meets expectations (4-6 pts):**
Acknowledges sportswashing but provides surface-level analysis. Stakeholder weighting has some justification but not brand-specific. Mentions trade-offs but doesn't wrestle with competing interests.

**Fully meets expectations (7-10 pts):**
Engages sportswashing with nuance—explains which stakeholder groups are most/least concerned and why. Stakeholder weighting is justified with brand-specific reasoning (e.g., "Budweiser weights fans higher than BMW because mass-market brands depend on broad appeal"). Explicitly addresses tensions between stakeholder interests and how the recommendation navigates them.

---

**CRITERION 4: Presentation Quality**

**Points:** 5

**Does not meet expectations (0-1 pts):**
Not in memo format. Missing required sections. Tables and calculations unclear or absent. Significantly over page limit.

**Partially meets expectations (2-3 pts):**
Memo format attempted but incomplete. Writing is adequate but could be clearer. Tables present but formatting inconsistent. Slightly over page limit.

**Fully meets expectations (4-5 pts):**
Professional memo format (To, From, Date, Subject, Body). Page 1 contains executive recommendation within 500 words. Page 2 contains clear stakeholder table and ROI calculations. Logical flow, concise writing, polished presentation.

---

**Template:** No template required

## Instructor Notes

**Purpose:**
- Assess Week 3 learning through authentic executive communication task
- AI Roleplay (Element 2) provides formative practice before summative assessment
- AI Feedback on submission helps students understand rubric alignment

**Grading Notes:**
- Focus on brand-specific analysis (BMW vs. Budweiser have different stakeholder weights)
- Look for evidence of analysis tool outputs (Ethical Decision Tool, Brand Risk Calculator)
- Ethical framework criterion rewards nuanced engagement with sportswashing debate
- Trade-off acknowledgment shows sophisticated thinking (not just "sponsor" or "don't sponsor")
