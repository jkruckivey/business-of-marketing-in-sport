- ✅ Include evaluation levels
- ✅ Apply points (40 points total)

---

**CRITERION 1: Strategic Clarity (10 points)**

**Description:**
Clear target audience, measurable objectives, and compelling rationale for brand-operator pairing.

**Does not meet expectations (0-6 points):**
The group provides vague or overly broad target audience (e.g., "NFL fans"), unclear or unmeasurable objectives (e.g., "increase sales"), or weak rationale for brand-operator pairing with no supporting logic.

**Partially meets expectations (7-8 points):**
The group defines a reasonable target audience and objectives with some specificity, but may lack demographic precision, measurability (SMART criteria), or compelling strategic logic connecting brand and operator strengths.

**Fully meets expectations (9-10 points):**
The group defines a specific, quantified target audience (demographics, psychographics, behavioral traits), sets SMART objectives (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound), and provides compelling strategic rationale supported by data from course modules (e.g., bettor engagement multipliers, CPM benchmarks).

---

**CRITERION 2: Activation Design (15 points)**

**Description:**
Creative, integrated tactics across multiple channels with appropriate budget allocation following 2-3× activation rule.

**Does not meet expectations (0-9 points):**
The group provides generic tactics without specificity (e.g., "social media campaign" with no platform or content details), fails to allocate budget across all required channels, or violates the 2-3× activation rule (activation budget should be 2-3× rights fee).

**Partially meets expectations (10-12 points):**
The group provides reasonable tactics across most channels with some specificity, follows budget allocation guidelines, but tactics may lack creativity, integration across channels, or clear connection to betting partnership advantages (e.g., data access, engagement multipliers).

**Fully meets expectations (13-15 points):**
The group provides creative, specific tactics for all channels (advertising, digital, retail, experiential, measurement) with concrete examples, demonstrates smart budget allocation with clear justifications, and leverages betting partnership advantages (first-party data, attribution, engagement multipliers). Tactics are integrated and reinforce each other.

---

**CRITERION 3: ROI Justification (10 points)**

**Description:**
Realistic, data-driven ROI projections using course frameworks (CPM, engagement multipliers, conversion funnels). Clear attribution methodology.

**Does not meet expectations (0-6 points):**
The group provides unrealistic projections (e.g., 500% ROI without justification), missing or incomplete calculations, no attribution methodology, or fails to use course frameworks (CPM, engagement rates, conversion rates from widgets).

**Partially meets expectations (7-8 points):**
The group provides reasonable ROI projections using some course frameworks, but may be missing key assumptions (e.g., churn rate, attribution discount), lack conservative discounting for uncertainty, or not fully explain calculation methodology.

**Fully meets expectations (9-10 points):**
The group provides realistic, data-driven ROI projections using course frameworks (CPM from Sponsorship Valuation Calculator, engagement multipliers from Module 3, conversion funnels from ROI Calculator), includes clear attribution methodology (promo codes, data partnerships, geo lift studies), acknowledges conservative assumptions and uncertainties, and shows all calculation steps transparently.

---

**CRITERION 4: Presentation Quality (5 points)**

**Description:**
Professional formatting, clear writing, effective data visualization.

**Does not meet expectations (0-3 points):**
The plan has poor formatting (inconsistent fonts, unclear structure), unclear or verbose writing, missing data visualization (no tables or charts), or exceeds 2-page limit without justification.

**Partially meets expectations (4 points):**
The plan has acceptable formatting and clear writing, includes basic tables for budget and ROI, but may lack polish, have minor formatting inconsistencies, or miss opportunities for effective data visualization.

**Fully meets expectations (5 points):**
The plan demonstrates professional executive summary quality with polished formatting, concise and clear writing appropriate for business audience, effective data visualization (tables, charts), and stays within 2-page limit while including all required elements.

## Element 5: **RENUMBERED** - Text - PAIRR Feedback Phase Instructions (was Element 3)

**Copy this markdown directly into Uplimit:**

```markdown
# PAIRR Feedback Phase: Peer and AI Review + Reflection

Before submitting your final activation plan, your group will receive feedback from TWO sources: another group (peer review) and an AI writing assistant. Your group's task is to **critically evaluate both sources** and decide which feedback to apply.

**Why PAIRR?**
Sports marketing professionals increasingly use AI tools for campaign planning, content creation, and ROI modeling. This exercise teaches you to:
- Leverage AI for strategic improvement (not replacement)
- Critically evaluate AI output (it's not always right!)
- Combine human insight with AI efficiency
- Maintain your strategic thinking while using AI assistance

**Benefits:**
1. **Multiple perspectives:** Peers see execution feasibility; AI sees technical patterns and best practices
2. **Critical thinking:** Your group decides what feedback is valid (not blindly accepting)
3. **Better work:** Two sources catch more issues than one
4. **Workplace readiness:** Practice balancing AI assistance with human judgment

---

## Step 1: Submit Your Draft (Due: [Date] by 11:59 PM)

Upload your group's 80-90% complete draft activation plan to the shared Google Drive folder:
- **Format:** Google Doc (enable "Commenting" permissions) OR PDF
- **Filename:** `GroupX_ActivationPlan_BrandName_OperatorName_DRAFT.pdf`
- **Completeness:** Must have all major sections (strategy, tactics, budget, ROI projections)

**Draft Requirements:**
- Strategic clarity (target audience, objectives, brand-operator rationale)
- Activation design (tactics across all channels with budget allocation)
- ROI justification (CPM calculations, engagement multipliers, conversion projections)
- Professional formatting (tables, charts for budget/ROI)
- 1-2 pages (can refine to 2 pages max in revision)

---

## Step 2A: Peer Group Review (Due: [Date + 2 days] by 11:59 PM)

You've been paired with another group (check announcement for your assigned group). Complete the structured peer review form for their activation plan draft.

**Time Estimate:** 25-35 minutes

**Review Focus (Using Week 3 Rubric):**
1. **Strategic Clarity (10 pts):** Is target audience specific and quantified? Are objectives SMART? Is brand-operator pairing strategically sound?
2. **Activation Design (15 pts):** Are tactics specific (not generic)? Do they leverage betting partnership advantages? Is budget allocation appropriate (2-3× rule)?
3. **ROI Justification (10 pts):** Did they use course frameworks? Are projections realistic? Is attribution methodology clear?
4. **Presentation Quality (5 pts):** Professional formatting? Clear tables/charts? Within 2-page limit?

**What Makes Good Peer Feedback:**
- **Specific:** "Your Nike + FanDuel TikTok challenge is creative, but you didn't specify success metrics—how many participants is 'successful'?"
- **Constructive:** "Consider increasing Measurement budget from 3% to 8% to track attribution more rigorously"
- **Evidence-based:** "Your CPM of $25 is strong compared to the $30-50 benchmark from Module 2 widget"
- **Balanced:** Identify both strengths AND improvement opportunities

**Submit peer review using Element 4 form below.**

---

## Step 2B: AI Feedback (Due: [Date + 2 days] by 11:59 PM)

Have ONE group member use an AI writing assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini) to get feedback on the same draft you submitted for peer review.

### AI Feedback Prompt Template

**Copy this prompt into your AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.):**

```
You are a sports marketing strategy consultant evaluating a 1-page sponsorship activation plan for an MBA course assignment. The assignment asks student groups to design an activation plan for a brand partnering with a sports betting operator (e.g., Nike + FanDuel, Coca-Cola + DraftKings).

RUBRIC CRITERIA (40 points total):
1. Strategic Clarity (10 pts): Clear target audience (specific demographics/psychographics), measurable SMART objectives, compelling rationale for brand-operator pairing supported by data.
2. Activation Design (15 pts): Creative, specific tactics across multiple channels (advertising, digital, retail, experiential, measurement). Budget allocation follows 2-3× activation rule. Tactics leverage betting partnership advantages (first-party data, engagement multipliers, attribution).
3. ROI Justification (10 pts): Realistic, data-driven ROI projections using course frameworks (CPM calculations, engagement multipliers, conversion funnels). Clear attribution methodology. Conservative assumptions acknowledged.
4. Presentation Quality (5 pts): Professional executive summary format. Clear, concise writing. Effective data visualization (tables, charts). Within 2-page limit.

Please evaluate this activation plan draft against these criteria. For each criterion:
- Identify what the group did well (specific strengths with examples)
- Identify what could be improved (actionable, specific suggestions)
- Estimate a score category (Exceeds Expectations / Fully Meets / Partially Meets / Does Not Meet)

Pay special attention to:
- Are tactics specific enough to be executable? (e.g., "TikTok campaign" is too vague; "TikTok dance challenge with branded filters, $50K influencer budget targeting 18-34 sports bettors" is specific)
- Do ROI projections use realistic industry benchmarks from the course? (CPM $30-50, engagement multipliers 40% for bettors, conversion rates 2-5%)
- Is the brand-operator pairing strategically sound? (e.g., premium brand + mass-market operator = mismatch)

Here is the activation plan draft:

[PASTE YOUR GROUP'S DRAFT HERE - Include executive summary, tactics, budget table, ROI projections]
```

**Important Instructions:**
1. Use the EXACT prompt above (ensures consistent feedback across groups)
2. Copy the AI's response into a Google Doc for later comparison
3. Take screenshots showing the AI conversation (for comparative reflection)
4. Share AI feedback document with all group members

**Time Estimate:** 5-10 minutes

---

## Step 3: Comparative Reflection (Due: [Date + 3 days] by 11:59 PM)

Now that your group has feedback from BOTH sources (peer group + AI), critically compare them.

**ONE group member submits this reflection on behalf of the group (150-250 words):**

### Comparative Reflection Questions

**Question 1: Feedback Quality Comparison (50-75 words)**
- What did the peer group notice that the AI missed?
- What did the AI notice that peers missed?
- Were there areas where they disagreed? Which feedback seemed more accurate for a sports marketing context?

**Question 2: Strengths and Limitations (50-75 words)**

**Peer Group Feedback:**
- Strength: [What was most valuable? e.g., industry insights, execution feasibility]
- Limitation: [What was missing or unclear? e.g., lacked technical critique]

**AI Feedback:**
- Strength: [What was most valuable? e.g., systematic analysis, best practices]
- Limitation: [What was inaccurate or too generic? e.g., couldn't evaluate brand fit without industry context]

**Question 3: Application Strategy (50-100 words)**
- Which feedback will your group prioritize in revision? Why?
- What criteria are you using to decide which suggestions to implement?
- How does this exercise change how you'll use AI in future marketing planning tasks?

**Submit your reflection using Element 4B form below.**

---

## Step 4: Revise Your Activation Plan (Days 7-8)

Apply insights from BOTH feedback sources:

**Revision Checklist:**
- [ ] Addressed peer feedback on activation tactics (specificity, feasibility)
- [ ] Addressed AI feedback on ROI methodology and presentation quality
- [ ] Evaluated competing suggestions and chose best approach
- [ ] Maintained professional formatting and executive tone
- [ ] Stayed within 2-page limit
- [ ] Used course frameworks (CPM, engagement multipliers, conversion funnels)

**Tip:** You are NOT required to implement ALL suggestions. Use your group's judgment to prioritize changes that most strengthen your strategic argument and ROI justification.

---

## Step 5: Post-Revision Reflection (Submit with final plan)

After revising your activation plan, ONE group member completes this brief reflection on behalf of the group (75-100 words):

**Prompt:**
"Which feedback source (peer group or AI) had the most influence on your group's revisions? Give 1-2 specific examples of changes you made based on each source. Did the comparative reflection process help your group make better revision decisions than you would have with a single feedback source? How will you use AI tools differently in future marketing planning projects?"

**Format:** Include this reflection as Page 3 addendum to your final submission (does not count toward 2-page limit).

**Submit this reflection using Element 4C form below.**

---

## PAIRR Participation Bonus: Up to 5 Points

- Completed peer group review form: **2 points**
- Obtained AI feedback (verified by screenshot): **1 point**
- Completed comparative reflection: **1 point**
- Completed post-revision reflection: **1 point**

**Total Possible:** 45 points (40 base assignment + 5 bonus)

---

## Why This Matters for Your Career

**Real sports marketing scenario:**
You're a marketing manager at Nike. Your agency presents a $20M FanDuel partnership activation plan. You also run it through an AI strategy tool (increasingly common in 2024-2025). The agency says "spend 60% on experiential events." The AI says "spend 40% on digital attribution." How do you decide?

**PAIRR teaches you to:**
1. Leverage multiple information sources (human experts + AI tools)
2. Critically evaluate each source's strengths and limitations
3. Make evidence-based decisions integrating both perspectives
4. Maintain strategic ownership (you decide, not AI)

This is the future of marketing strategy work. Practice it now.

**Next elements:** Peer review form (Element 6), AI feedback submission (Element 7), Comparative reflection form (Element 8), Post-revision reflection form (Element 9).

**Element Type:** Text Response (Short answer, ungraded)

**Uplimit Configuration:**

### Tab 1: Instructions

**Question:**
```
Reflect on your Week 3 learning by answering these 3 questions (250 words total).
```

**Additional Instructions:**
```
**Reflection Questions (Optional, Ungraded)**

**Question 1 (75-100 words):** What surprised you most about sponsorship economics this week? Did anything challenge your assumptions about how brands value sports partnerships?

**Question 2 (75-100 words):** How did sports betting integration change your understanding of sponsorship value? Before this week, did you realize bettors watch 40% more games, or that betting sponsors can track attribution better than traditional sponsors?

**Question 3 (75-100 words):** If you were a brand CMO deciding between a $10M NFL jersey sponsor deal and a $12M FanDuel partnership (20% premium), which would you choose and why? Use frameworks from this week to justify your decision.

**Question 4 (75-100 words) - METACOGNITIVE REFLECTION:** Which learning activity this week helped you understand sponsorship ROI most effectively—interactive widgets (CPM calculator, budget builder, ROI tool), FanDuel case study analysis, group collaboration on activation plan, or executive videos? Why did that modality work best for YOU? How can you apply that insight to optimize your learning in Week 4 (Athletes & Brands)?

**Why Reflect?**
Reflection consolidates learning. Research shows students who reflect on course content retain 30% more information than those who don't. Question 4's metacognitive reflection (thinking about HOW you learn) helps you optimize future learning strategies. This is ungraded—purely for your benefit.

[0:00-0:15] Week 3 Recap
"Congratulations on completing Week 3: Sponsorship & Betting. You've learned how brands value sports partnerships, why betting sponsors pay 20-30% premiums, and how to design ROI-driven activation plans. Let's review the key takeaways."

[0:15-0:45] Week 3 Key Takeaways
"Three frameworks to remember:
1. **Sponsorship ROI:** Calculate CPM (rights fee / impressions × 1,000), allocate activation budget at 2-3× rights fee, measure through reach-engagement-conversion funnel.
2. **Betting Economics:** Bettors are the most valuable fans—40% more viewership, 3× digital engagement, 2× merchandise spending. Betting partnerships offer attribution advantages (first-party data) that traditional sponsors can't match.
3. **Activation Design:** Generic tactics fail. Specific, integrated campaigns across advertising, digital, retail, experiential, and measurement channels deliver measurable ROI. Always ask: What's the engagement mechanism? How do we attribute sales?"

[0:45-1:15] Connection to Week 4
"Week 4 shifts from league/team sponsorships to individual athletes and emerging sports. You'll learn:
- How athletes build personal brands (case: Serena Williams)
- Why women's sports sponsorship grew 300% in 5 years
- How to evaluate emerging sports investments (Pickleball, Padel, esports)
- Whether brands should sign athletes vs. sponsor leagues

**Key Question:** Serena Williams charges $12M/year for endorsements. LeBron James charges $20M. How do brands decide if that's worth it? You'll learn the athlete ROI framework."

[1:15-1:45] Week 4 Preparation

## 🎯 FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION - WEEK 3 COMPLETE

**You Just Built the Financial Foundation for Your Final Project**

Week 3 was the most technical week of the course—you learned the frameworks that sports marketers use daily to value partnerships, calculate ROI, and justify sponsorship investments. **These skills directly translate to your Week 5 final project.**

**Week 3 Mastery → Final Project Application:**

**Skill 1: Sponsorship Valuation (Module 2)**
- **What you learned:** Calculate CPM, apply 2-3× activation rule, model ROI through reach-engagement-conversion funnel
- **Final project application (Slides 4 & 6):** "Our property delivers 50M impressions at $100 CPM—10× cheaper than TV ads. Title sponsors invest $5M + $10-15M activation and earn 36% ROI through our first-party data partnerships."

**Skill 2: Betting Partnership Economics (Module 3)**
- **What you learned:** Bettors watch 40% more games, betting sponsors pay 20-30% premiums for attribution data
- **Final project application (Slide 4):** "If our property is in a betting-legal market, we'll offer 'Official Betting Partner' tier at $10-15M (premium pricing justified by engagement multipliers and closed-loop attribution)."

**Skill 3: Case-Based Strategic Analysis (Module 4)**
- **What you learned:** Analyze competitive positioning, evaluate partnership ROI, model customer economics
- **Final project application (Slide 2: Business Context):** "Our property faces competition from [X, Y, Z]. FanDuel's case taught us exclusive partnerships (PGA $85 CAC) outperform shared (NFL $110 CAC). We'll offer category exclusivity in 5 tiers to maximize partner value."

**Skill 4: Activation Plan Design (Module 5)**
- **What you learned:** Design specific, executable tactics across 5 channels with ROI projections
- **Final project application (Slide 5: Activation Plan):** "We offer sponsors turnkey activation across advertising (broadcast integration), digital (app placement), retail (point-of-sale), experiential (VIP hospitality), and measurement (attribution tracking). Our template delivered 36% ROI for Nike in Week 3 analysis."

## Final Project Readiness Check

After Week 3, you should be able to answer YES to these questions:

**Slide 4: Sponsorship/Media Strategy - Can you explain how your property makes money?**
- ✅ Can you identify 3-5 sponsorship tiers with pricing ($500K-$20M)?
- ✅ Can you justify why brands would pay those amounts (CPM calculations, engagement data)?
- ✅ Can you explain category exclusivity strategy (which sponsors get exclusivity, why)?
- ✅ Can you position betting partnerships (if applicable to your market)?

**Slide 5: Activation Plan - Can you show sponsors what they'll GET for their investment?**
- ✅ Can you design specific activation tactics (not generic "social media campaign")?
- ✅ Can you allocate activation budget across 5 channels with rationale?
- ✅ Can you demonstrate integration across channels (how tactics reinforce each other)?

**Slide 6: Financial Snapshot - Can you PROVE your property delivers sponsor ROI?**
- ✅ Can you calculate CPM for your property's reach?
- ✅ Can you model sponsor ROI using reach-engagement-conversion funnel?
- ✅ Can you benchmark your property vs. alternatives (other sports, traditional advertising)?
- ✅ Can you acknowledge conservative assumptions (attribution discounts, churn rates)?

**If you answered YES to 10+ questions above, Week 3 prepared you well for final project financial sections.**

## What You're Carrying Forward to Week 5

**Data You Should Save:**
1. **Widget Exports (JSON/CSV):** All calculations from Sponsorship Valuation Calculator, ROI Calculator, Activation Budget Builder, Customer Economics Calculator—reuse these in your final project financial appendix
2. **Your Group's Activation Plan:** This document is your Slide 5 template—adapt it for your property
3. **Peer Review Feedback:** The rubric criteria (strategic clarity, activation design, ROI justification, presentation quality) apply to final project grading too

**Frameworks You Should Remember:**
- CPM calculation: Rights fee / impressions × 1,000
- Activation rule: 2-3× rights fee
- ROI funnel: Reach → Engagement → Conversion
- Betting premium: 20-30% more for attribution + engagement multipliers
- Partnership economics: CAC, LTV, payback period, profitability

**Skills You Should Apply:**
- Specificity over generality (concrete examples, not vague tactics)
- Data-driven justification (benchmarks from course widgets, not unsupported claims)
- Conservative assumptions (acknowledge uncertainty, discount projections 30% for attribution)
- Professional presentation (executive summary format, clear tables/charts)

## Week 4 Preview: Adding the Athlete Dimension

Week 3 taught sponsorship economics at the institutional level (leagues, teams, betting operators). **Week 4 adds the athlete dimension:**

- Should Nike sponsor the NBA (league) or sign LeBron James (athlete)?
- How do athletes build brand value independently of their teams?
- Why are brands investing 300% more in women's sports?
- How do you evaluate emerging sports (Pickleball, esports) as sponsorship opportunities?

**Final Project Impact:**
Your Week 5 marketing plan can include athlete endorsements as part of your sponsorship strategy. Week 4 teaches you:
- **Slide 5 addition:** "We'll sign 3 athletes as brand ambassadors ($500K-$2M each) to amplify sponsor activations through their social media reach (combined 10M followers)"
- **Slide 6 addition:** Calculate athlete ROI using Week 4's framework (social reach × engagement rate × conversion attribution)

**Prepare for Week 4:**
- Read Serena Williams case (HBS 517050)
- Watch sports agent interview video
- Think: Who's your favorite athlete? What brands do they endorse? Why?
