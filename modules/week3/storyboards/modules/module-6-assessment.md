# Finalize and Submit Your Strategy Memo

You've built your analysis using the Ethical Sponsorship Decision Tool and Brand Risk Calculator. You've reviewed the rubric and seen example memos at different grade levels. Now it's time to finalize and submit.

**Before you submit**, use the AI Roleplay below to practice your pitch. Presenting to a skeptical CMO will help you stress-test your recommendation and identify any gaps in your argument.

**Then submit your 2-page memo** using the file upload below.

## Element 2: AI Roleplay - Brand CMO Practice Pitch

**Scenario Title:** "CMO Sponsorship Decision"

**Purpose:** Stress-test your recommendation before finalizing your memo.

### Uplimit Configuration

**Scenario Context:**
```
You've drafted your sponsorship strategy memo. Before you submit, pitch your recommendation to the CMO who will receive it.

You are a sponsorship consultant presenting to the CMO of your chosen brand (BMW, Mastercard, Budweiser, or Rolex). The CMO is considering a $10M LIV Golf sponsorship and wants your recommendation. They need to defend this decision to the board, so they're looking for rigorous analysis—not just opinions.

Use this roleplay to stress-test your arguments. If the CMO finds gaps, revise your memo before submitting.
```

**AI Role:**
```
You are a CMO at a major brand considering a $10M LIV Golf sponsorship. You're open-minded but skeptical—you need the consultant to convince you with data, not opinions.

Conversation flow:
1. Ask for their recommendation (sponsor or not?) and why
2. Probe the stakeholder analysis (who wins, who loses, how did they weight it?)
3. Challenge the ROI calculation (what assumptions are baked in?)
4. Ask about the sportswashing angle (how will customers react?)
5. Push back with a counter-argument to their recommendation

Be professional but challenging. After 5-6 exchanges, wrap up: "Good analysis. If your memo is as tight as this pitch, the board will be convinced. Submit it."
```

**Student Instructions:**
```
You are a sponsorship consultant presenting your LIV Golf recommendation to a brand CMO. Pitch your analysis as if presenting the memo you've drafted.

Use this to stress-test your arguments. If the CMO finds gaps, revise your memo before submitting.
```

## Instructor Notes

**Purpose:**
- Assess Week 3 learning through authentic executive communication task
- AI Roleplay provides formative practice before summative assessment

**AI Feedback Option (Optional):**
If you want students to get AI feedback before submitting, provide this prompt:
```
You are evaluating a 2-page sponsorship strategy memo. The assignment asks students to advise a brand on whether to sponsor LIV Golf.

RUBRIC CRITERIA:
1. Strategic Clarity (10 pts): Clear recommendation with brand-specific rationale
2. Analytical Rigor (15 pts): Complete stakeholder and ROI analysis
3. Ethical Framework (10 pts): Thoughtful stakeholder weighting
4. Presentation Quality (5 pts): Professional memo format

Evaluate the memo against these criteria, identifying strengths and specific improvement suggestions.
```

**Grading Notes:**
- Focus on brand-specific analysis (BMW vs. Budweiser have different stakeholder weights)
- Look for evidence of analysis tool outputs (Ethical Decision Tool, Brand Risk Calculator)
- Ethical framework criterion rewards nuanced engagement with sportswashing debate
- Trade-off acknowledgment shows sophisticated thinking (not just "sponsor" or "don't sponsor")
