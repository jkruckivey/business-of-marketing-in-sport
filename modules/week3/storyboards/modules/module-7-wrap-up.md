## Element 1: Week 3 Key Takeaways - Sponsorship & Betting

```
Title: ◉ Week 3 Key Takeaways

You've completed your deep dive into sponsorship and betting economics! The five critical insights: (1) sponsorship ROI is calculated using CPM, reach metrics, and the 1:2-3 activation rule—rights fees are just the start, (2) sports betting creates engagement multipliers where bettors watch 40% more games, driving premium partnership valuations, (3) ethical considerations like sportswashing require stakeholder impact analysis beyond financial metrics, (4) controversy-adjusted ROI helps quantify brand risk when sponsors have reputational concerns, and (5) professional sponsorship decisions balance quantitative frameworks with ethical judgment. This foundation prepares you for Week 4's focus on athlete brands and emerging sports—where individual athletes build wealth beyond endorsement fees. Well done!

**Up Next:** CFL Expansion Milestone 3, then Week 4 preview.

## CFL Expansion Project: Milestone 3 - Sponsorship & Partnership Strategy

Your CFL expansion city needs sponsors. In Milestone 1, you analyzed market feasibility. In Milestone 2, you designed media and fan engagement strategy. Now you'll build the sponsorship portfolio for your chosen city.

**Your Challenge:** Design a sponsorship strategy for your CFL expansion team that identifies target sponsor categories, calculates expected revenue using CPM benchmarks, and addresses ethical considerations.

**Why This Matters:** Sponsorship accounts for 15-25% of professional sports revenue. Your expansion team needs sponsors to survive financially—but the wrong sponsors can damage brand equity before you've built it.

**Apply Week 3 Frameworks:**
- Use CPM calculations to value your sponsorship assets
- Apply the 1:2-3 activation rule to project total partnership value
- Consider engagement multipliers if pursuing betting partnerships
- Reference your Milestone 1-2 work for market-specific sponsor targeting
