## Week 3 Complete: Sponsorship, Betting & Ethical Complexity

You've completed the most analytically rigorous week of this course. Let's consolidate what you've learned.

**Module 2 - Sponsorship Framework:**
- CPM calculations to value sponsorship exposure
- The 1:2-3 activation rule (activation costs exceed rights fees)
- ROI funnels: Reach → Engagement → Conversion

**Module 3 - Betting Economics:**
- PASPA repeal and state-by-state legalization
- Handle vs. GGR vs. operator profit
- The engagement multiplier: bettors watch 40% more games
- Why betting partnerships often command 20-30% premiums

**Module 4 - LIV Golf Case Study:**
- Sportswashing definition and debate
- Stakeholder impact analysis for controversial sponsorships
- Controversy-adjusted ROI calculations
- No "right answer" on ethical sponsorship decisions

**Module 5-6 - Strategy Memo:**
- Applied all frameworks to a real sponsorship decision
- Balanced quantitative analysis with ethical considerations
- Professional memo format for executive communication

**Key Insight:** Sponsorship decisions aren't just math problems. The frameworks give you rigor, but ethical judgment determines whether you should pursue opportunities that pass the ROI test.

## Element 3: Anchor Project Milestone 3 Introduction

```markdown
## CFL Expansion Project: Milestone 3 - Sponsorship & Partnership Strategy

Your CFL expansion city needs sponsors. In Milestone 1, you analyzed market feasibility. In Milestone 2, you designed media and fan engagement strategy. Now you'll build the sponsorship portfolio.

**Your Challenge:** Design a sponsorship strategy for your CFL expansion team that:
1. Identifies 3-5 target sponsor categories (with specific brand examples)
2. Calculates expected sponsorship revenue using CPM benchmarks
3. Addresses at least one sponsorship decision with ethical complexity
4. Connects sponsor strategy to your city's unique market characteristics

**Why This Matters:** Sponsorship accounts for 15-25% of professional sports revenue. Your expansion team needs sponsors to survive financially—but the WRONG sponsors can damage brand equity before you've built it.

**Apply Week 3 Frameworks:**
- Use CPM calculations from Module 2 to value your sponsorship assets
- Apply the 1:2-3 activation rule to project total partnership value
- Consider engagement multipliers if pursuing betting partnerships
- Use the ethical decision framework if any sponsor categories raise concerns

**Submission:** Use the CFL City Selector tool to generate your Milestone 3 template, complete the sponsorship strategy, and submit below.

## Element 5: Milestone 3 Full Instructions (Details)

```
Title: CFL Expansion Milestone 3: Full Instructions

[Expand for detailed requirements]

## Step 1: Open Your CFL City Selector Tool

Navigate to the CFL City Selector widget and select your expansion city. The tool will generate:
- Market demographics relevant to sponsors (population, income, sports affinity)
- Local brand landscape (major employers, regional brands, competitive sponsors)
- Sponsorship asset inventory (stadium naming, jersey, in-stadium, digital)

## Step 2: Build Your Sponsor Category Matrix

Create a table with 3-5 sponsor categories:

| Category | Target Brand(s) | Estimated Value | Strategic Fit | Priority |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|----------|
| Naming Rights | [Brand] | $[X]M/year | [Why this brand?] | High/Med/Low |
| Jersey Sponsor | [Brand] | $[X]M/year | [Why this brand?] | High/Med/Low |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Required Categories:** Naming rights, jersey sponsor, and at least one of: betting partner, beverage, automotive, financial services, telecommunications

## Step 3: CPM Analysis

For your top 2 sponsorship assets, calculate CPM:
- Input: Rights fee estimate, broadcast reach, games per season, digital impressions
- Use the Sponsorship Valuation Calculator from Module 2
- Show your work: Total impressions, CPM calculation, benchmark comparison

## Step 4: Design One Activation

Choose your naming rights OR jersey sponsor. Design a detailed activation:
- **Objective:** What behavior are you driving?
- **Tactic:** What will fans experience?
- **Budget:** Follow the 2-3× rule
- **Measurement:** How will you prove ROI?

## Step 5: Address Ethical Complexity

Every sponsorship portfolio has at least one decision with complexity. Address one:
- **Betting Partnership:** Should your new franchise partner with FanDuel/DraftKings? (Apply Module 3 engagement multiplier + Module 4 ethical framework)
- **Resource Extraction Sponsor:** What if a mining company offers naming rights in Halifax?
- **Controversial Brand:** What if a brand with recent controversy offers premium rates?

Use the Ethical Sponsorship Decision Tool framework:
- Identify stakeholders
- Rate expected impacts
- Make a recommendation with rationale

## Submission Format

- **Length:** 2-3 pages
- **Format:** PDF upload
- **Include:** Sponsor matrix table, CPM calculations, activation concept, ethical analysis
