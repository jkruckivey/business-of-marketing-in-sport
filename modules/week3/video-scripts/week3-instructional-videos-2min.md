## Video 1: Bridge-In - "The $500 Million Question"
**Module:** 0 (Bridge-In)
**Duration:** 2 minutes
**Purpose:** Hook students with sponsorship ROI paradox

```
[0:00-0:20] INTRODUCTION & CREDIBILITY
"Hi, I'm [NAME], and I've spent [X] years on the brand side of sports marketing—negotiating sponsorships, building activations, and trying to justify why we pay millions of dollars to put our logo on a jersey.

And I want to start Week 3 with a question that haunts every CMO I know."

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "The $500 Million Question"]

[0:20-1:00] THE PARADOX
"Nike pays over $500 million per year in sports sponsorships. Worldwide. Every league, every athlete, every major property you can think of.

Your CFO looks at this budget and asks: 'What are we getting for half a billion dollars?'

So you show them the metrics: 15 billion social media impressions, 3.2 billion TV viewers reached, 92% brand awareness among sports fans.

And they ask the killer follow-up: 'How many shoes did that sell?'

Silence. Because here's the uncomfortable truth: most sponsorship ROI is fuzzy. We measure impressions, not conversions."

[1:00-1:40] THE BETTING GAME-CHANGER
"But something changed in 2018. Sports betting legalization created sponsors who CAN measure conversion: FanDuel, DraftKings, BetMGM.

When a betting operator sponsors a team, they know exactly how many people downloaded the app, placed a bet, and became customers. That attribution loop changes everything about sponsorship valuation."

[1:40-2:00] WEEK 3 PREVIEW
"This week, you'll learn to think like both sides: the brand trying to prove ROI, and the betting operator who actually can. By Friday, you'll design an activation plan that answers the CFO's question with data, not hope."

## Video 2: Welcome - Executive Perspective on Sponsorship ROI
**Module:** 1 (Welcome)
**Duration:** 2 minutes
**Purpose:** Set industry context from practitioner perspective

```
[0:00-0:15] Introduction
"I lead sports sponsorship for [Brand]. We spend $XX million annually on partnerships. Here's how we decide where to invest—and how we measure success."

[0:15-0:45] Rights Fees vs. Activation
"A common mistake: thinking the rights fee is the investment. Wrong. For every $1 in rights fees, brands spend $2-3 on activation. If we pay $5 million to sponsor a team, we'll spend $10-15 million amplifying it through ads, hospitality, content, and retail. The real question isn't 'Can we afford the rights?'—it's 'Can we activate at scale?'"

[0:45-1:15] ROI Framework
"We measure three layers: Reach (how many people saw our brand?), Engagement (did they interact?), and Conversion (did they buy?). Reach is easy—broadcast impressions, social media views. Engagement requires data partnerships—app downloads, website visits. Conversion is hardest—tying sales to sponsorship exposure. That's where betting partnerships excel."

[1:15-1:45] Betting Integration Advantage
"When we partner with FanDuel or DraftKings, we access first-party data: who bet, what they bet on, when they converted. That attribution loop is impossible with traditional jersey sponsors. Sports betting operators offer co-marketing deals where we share customer acquisition costs and conversion data. It's why betting-integrated sponsorships command 20-30% premiums."

[1:45-2:00] Conclusion
"Your activation plan this week needs to answer: What's the reach? What's the engagement mechanism? How do we measure conversion? Think like a CFO, not just a marketer."

## Video 3: Sponsorship 101 - The Value Framework
**Module:** 2 (Sponsorship Framework)
**Duration:** 2 minutes
**Purpose:** Explain sponsorship economics and CPM benchmarks

```
[0:00-0:15] Hook
"Why does Coca-Cola pay FIFA hundreds of millions to sponsor the World Cup? Because 3.5 billion people watch it—but that's not the whole story."

[0:15-0:45] Rights Fees Explained
"Sponsorship has two costs: rights fees (what you pay the property) and activation costs (what you spend amplifying the partnership). If Coke pays FIFA $300M per year in rights, they'll spend $600-900M in activation—ads during matches, retail displays, hospitality, branded content. The rights fee is just the entry ticket."

[0:45-1:15] What Brands Get
"In exchange, sponsors receive: (1) Reach - logo exposure across broadcasts, stadiums, digital; (2) Engagement - branded activations, hospitality, fan experiences; (3) Category exclusivity - Coke blocks Pepsi from the tournament. That exclusivity premium is worth 30-50% of the rights fee alone."

[1:15-1:45] CPM Benchmark
"Brands measure sponsorship like advertising: cost per thousand impressions (CPM). Super Bowl ads cost $7,000 CPM. NFL jersey sponsors pay $500-1,500 CPM. Why the discount? Frequency. Fans see a jersey sponsor 20-30 times per season. That repetition builds brand recall better than one-time ads."

[1:45-2:00] Transition
"Next, you'll use the Sponsorship Valuation Calculator to model real deals. Input reach, frequency, and costs to calculate CPM and exposure value—the first step in ROI analysis."

## Video 4: Sports Betting 101 - Why Bettors Are the Most Valuable Fans
**Module:** 3 (Betting Economics)
**Duration:** 2 minutes
**Purpose:** Explain betting economics and engagement multiplier

```
[0:00-0:15] Hook
"Sports bettors watch 40% more live sports than non-bettors. They engage 3× more on digital platforms. They spend 2× more on merchandise. That's why betting operators pay premium sponsorship rates."

[0:15-0:45] The Engagement Multiplier
"Betting transforms passive viewers into active participants. When you have money on a game, every play matters. That engagement translates to longer viewing times, more ad exposure, and higher brand recall. For sponsors, bettors are the ultimate target audience—engaged, affluent, and trackable."

[0:45-1:15] Attribution Advantage
"Traditional sponsors struggle to prove ROI. How do you connect a jersey logo to shoe sales? Betting operators don't have this problem. Every customer has an account. Every bet is tracked. When FanDuel sponsors the NBA, they know exactly how many customers came from broadcast exposure vs. social media vs. stadium signage. That attribution data is worth billions."

[1:15-1:45] Premium Pricing
"This is why betting sponsors pay 20-30% premiums over traditional sponsors. They're not just buying impressions—they're buying customers with measurable lifetime value. A sports betting customer is worth $500-1,500 in lifetime revenue. If sponsorship drives 100,000 new customers, that's $50-150 million in value."

[1:45-2:00] Transition
"Next, you'll use the Betting Economics Calculator to model customer acquisition costs, lifetime value, and the ROI of betting-integrated sponsorships."
```

## Video 5: FanDuel Case Context
**Module:** 4 (Case Study)
**Duration:** 2 minutes
**Purpose:** Frame FanDuel case study analysis

```
[0:00-0:15] Hook
"FanDuel spent $1 billion on marketing in 2021. That's more than Nike spends on sports sponsorships globally. Why? Because customer acquisition in sports betting is a winner-take-most game."

[0:15-0:45] The Land Grab
"When sports betting legalized state-by-state starting in 2018, operators faced a strategic choice: acquire customers now at any cost, or wait and lose market share forever. FanDuel and DraftKings chose aggression—spending $100+ per customer acquisition when lifetime value was projected at $500-1,500. The math only works if you win market share."

[0:45-1:15] Sponsorship as Customer Acquisition
"FanDuel's sponsorship strategy is pure customer acquisition. Every NFL partnership, every stadium naming rights deal, every broadcast integration has one goal: get the app downloaded. Unlike traditional sponsors measuring 'brand awareness,' FanDuel measures cost-per-install and cost-per-first-deposit."

[1:15-1:45] The Sustainability Question
"Here's the case dilemma: Is this spending sustainable? FanDuel lost money for years while acquiring customers. Now they need those customers to generate lifetime value. If customer retention is lower than projected, the entire model collapses. Your analysis should evaluate: What's the path to profitability?"

[1:45-2:00] Transition
"As you read the FanDuel case, focus on customer economics: acquisition cost, lifetime value, retention rates, and the breakeven timeline. The AI Case Coach will help you analyze these metrics."

## Video 6: Group Sprint Guide
**Module:** 5 (Group Sprint)
**Duration:** 2 minutes
**Purpose:** Prepare students for activation plan sprint

```
[0:00-0:15] Introduction
"You have 45-60 minutes to design a sponsorship activation plan worth 40 points. Here's how to make the most of your group sprint."

[0:15-0:45] Time Allocation (45-Minute Sprint)
"Divide your time into 4 phases:
- Phase 1 (10 min): Brainstorm - Choose brand + operator, define target audience, set objectives
- Phase 2 (15 min): Activation tactics - Assign each member one channel (advertising, digital, retail, experiential), design specific tactics
- Phase 3 (15 min): Budget + ROI - Use widgets to model ROI, allocate budget across channels, calculate projections
- Phase 4 (5 min): Synthesis - Combine sections into one Google Doc, quick proofread, save as PDF"

[0:45-1:15] Role Division
"Assign roles based on strengths:
- **Strategist:** Writes strategic foundation (target audience, objectives, rationale)
- **Creative:** Leads activation tactics (brainstorms specific campaigns, examples)
- **Analyst:** Owns budget allocation and ROI projections (uses widgets, builds spreadsheet)
- **Editor:** Synthesizes all sections, proofreads, formats final PDF

All members contribute ideas, but clear ownership prevents duplicated work."

[1:15-1:45] Collaboration Tips
"Use Google Docs for real-time collaboration. Start with the Template Builder widget—it gives you a skeleton to fill in. Don't overthink—better to have a complete 'B' plan than an incomplete 'A+' plan. Use the AI Coach widget if stuck, but don't let it write for you (academic integrity). Widget outputs can go in an appendix (doesn't count toward 2-page limit)."

[1:45-2:00] Common Pitfalls
"Avoid these mistakes: (1) Unrealistic ROI projections (500% ROI is not realistic), (2) Generic tactics ('social media campaign' is too vague—be specific!), (3) Missing attribution methodology (how will you prove it worked?), (4) Ignoring the 2-3× activation rule (activation should be 2-3× rights fee). Good luck!"

## Video 7: Week 3 Recap & Week 4 Preview
**Module:** 6 (Assessment/Wrap-Up)
**Duration:** 2 minutes
**Purpose:** Summarize key takeaways and preview next week

```
[0:00-0:15] Week 3 Recap
"Congratulations on completing Week 3: Sponsorship & Betting. You've learned how brands value sports partnerships, why betting sponsors pay 20-30% premiums, and how to design ROI-driven activation plans. Let's review the key takeaways."

[0:15-0:45] Week 3 Key Takeaways
"Three frameworks to remember:
1. **Sponsorship ROI:** Calculate CPM (rights fee / impressions × 1,000), allocate activation budget at 2-3× rights fee, measure through reach-engagement-conversion funnel.
2. **Betting Economics:** Bettors are the most valuable fans—40% more viewership, 3× digital engagement, 2× merchandise spending. Betting partnerships offer attribution advantages (first-party data) that traditional sponsors can't match.
3. **Activation Design:** Generic tactics fail. Specific, integrated campaigns across advertising, digital, retail, experiential, and measurement channels deliver measurable ROI. Always ask: What's the engagement mechanism? How do we attribute sales?"

[0:45-1:15] Connection to Week 4
"Week 4 shifts from league/team sponsorships to individual athletes and emerging sports. You'll learn:
- How athletes build personal brands (case: Serena Williams)
- Why women's sports sponsorship grew 300% in 5 years
- How to evaluate emerging sports investments (Pickleball, Padel, esports)
- Whether brands should sign athletes vs. sponsor leagues

**Key Question:** Serena Williams charges $12M/year for endorsements. LeBron James charges $20M. How do brands decide if that's worth it? You'll learn the athlete ROI framework."

[1:15-1:45] Week 4 Preparation
"Before Week 4 starts:
- **Read:** Serena Williams: Building a Brand (HBS 517050) - purchase through course pack
- **Watch:** Interview with sports agent (posted to Uplimit)
- **Prepare:** Think about your favorite athlete. What brands do they endorse? Why those brands? We'll analyze this in Week 4 Module 1.

**Case prep time:** 25-30 minutes"

[1:45-2:00] Closing
"You've completed 3 weeks: Revenue Ecosystems (Week 1), Media Rights (Week 2), Sponsorship & Betting (Week 3). Next up: the human side of sports marketing—athletes, personal brands, and emerging markets. See you in Week 4!"
