## Video 1: Why Brands Pay - The Sponsorship Value Proposition (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Explain sponsorship economics before students use the Sponsorship Valuation Calculator
**Placement:** Module 2, Element 2

### SCRIPT

**[0:00-0:15] Hook**

**[ON-SCREEN: Coca-Cola logo + FIFA World Cup trophy]**

**NARRATOR:**
Why does Coca-Cola pay FIFA hundreds of millions to sponsor the World Cup? Because 3.5 billion people watch it—but that's not the whole story.

**[0:15-0:45] Rights Fees vs. Activation**

**[ANIMATION: Two cost buckets appearing]**

**NARRATOR:**
Sponsorship has two costs: **rights fees** and **activation costs**.

Rights fees are what you pay the property for the partnership. Activation costs are what you spend amplifying it—ads during matches, retail displays, hospitality, branded content.

**[ON-SCREEN: $300M rights + $600-900M activation = Total investment]**

If Coke pays FIFA $300 million per year in rights, they'll spend $600-900 million in activation. The rights fee is just the entry ticket. The real investment is 2-3× more.

**[0:45-1:15] What Sponsors Get**

**[ANIMATION: Three benefits appearing with icons]**

**NARRATOR:**
In exchange, sponsors receive three things:

**One: Reach.** Logo exposure across broadcasts, stadiums, and digital channels. The World Cup delivers 5 billion cumulative impressions.

**Two: Engagement.** Branded activations, hospitality suites, fan experiences. Coke hosts 50,000 guests at World Cup events.

**Three: Category exclusivity.** Coke blocks Pepsi from the tournament. That exclusivity premium is worth 30-50% of the rights fee alone.

---

**[1:15-1:45] CPM Benchmark**

**[ON-SCREEN: CPM comparison chart]**

**NARRATOR:**
Brands measure sponsorship like advertising: **CPM**—cost per thousand impressions.

Super Bowl ads cost $7,000 CPM. One 30-second spot.

NFL jersey sponsors pay $500-1,500 CPM. Why the discount?

**Frequency.** Fans see that jersey sponsor 20-30 times per season. That repetition builds brand recall better than any one-time ad.

**[1:45-2:00] Transition**

**[ON-SCREEN: Sponsorship Valuation Calculator preview]**

**NARRATOR:**
Next, you'll use the **Sponsorship Valuation Calculator** to model real deals. Input reach, frequency, and costs to calculate CPM and exposure value—the first step in ROI analysis.

## Video 2: Sports Betting Regulatory Landscape (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Explain PASPA repeal and market growth before students use the Betting Market Simulator
**Placement:** Module 3, Element 2

### SCRIPT

**[0:00-0:15] Hook**

**[ON-SCREEN: Supreme Court building + "$100 BILLION" text]**

**NARRATOR:**
In 2018, one Supreme Court decision unleashed a $100+ billion industry. Here's how sports betting transformed from illegal to mainstream in just five years.

---

**[0:15-0:45] PASPA Repeal**

**[ANIMATION: Map of US with states lighting up]**

**NARRATOR:**
For 25 years, **PASPA**—the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act—banned sports betting in 48 states. Only Nevada had legal sportsbooks.

In May 2018, the Supreme Court struck down PASPA in *Murphy v. NCAA*, declaring states could legalize betting independently.

**[ON-SCREEN: Timeline appearing]**

Within 24 hours, New Jersey launched legal sportsbooks. Within 5 years, **38 states** legalized sports betting.

---

**[0:45-1:15] Market Growth**

**[ANIMATION: Bar chart growing dramatically]**

**NARRATOR:**
The numbers are staggering:

**[ON-SCREEN: Key statistics appearing]**

- **$119.8 billion** wagered in 2023 (US total handle)
- Up from **zero** in 2017
- **FanDuel and DraftKings** control 70% market share
- **90%** of bets placed on mobile—this is a digital-first business
- Operators spend **$200-400 million** annually on customer acquisition

---

**[1:15-1:45] Why Leagues Embraced Betting**

**[ANIMATION: Three reasons with dollar signs]**

**NARRATOR:**
Leagues initially opposed betting, fearing integrity issues. Then they embraced it for three reasons:

**One:** Betting partnerships deliver **$300+ million** in annual sponsorship revenue across NFL, NBA, and MLB combined.

**Two:** Betting data feeds create a **new revenue stream**—$50-100 million per year.

**Three:** Bettors watch **40% more games** than non-bettors. Betting drives the very engagement that makes media rights valuable.

---

**[1:45-2:00] Transition**

**[ON-SCREEN: Betting Market Simulator preview]**

**NARRATOR:**
Next, you'll model a state betting market. Input population, betting penetration, and average wager to calculate total handle, operator revenue, and state tax revenue. See why states raced to legalize.
