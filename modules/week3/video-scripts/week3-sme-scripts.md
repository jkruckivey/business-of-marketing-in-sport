**[OPENING - 0:00-0:20]**

**[ON-SCREEN: "The $500 Million Question"]**

**SME:**
There's a question that haunts every CMO in sports marketing.

---

**[SECTION: THE PROBLEM - 0:20-1:00]**

**SME:**
Major brands spend hundreds of millions of dollars annually on sports sponsorships globally. For example, Nike's comprehensive sports sponsorship portfolio spans every league, athlete, and major property you can think of.

Your CFO looks at this budget and asks: What are we getting for this investment?

So you show them the metrics: billions of social media impressions, billions of TV viewers reached, high brand awareness among sports fans.

And they ask the killer follow-up: How many shoes did that sell?

Silence. Because here's the uncomfortable truth: most sponsorship ROI is fuzzy. We measure impressions, not conversions.

---

**[SECTION: THE CHANGE - 1:00-1:40]**

**SME:**
But something changed in 2018. Sports betting legalization created sponsors who CAN measure conversion: FanDuel, DraftKings, BetMGM.

When a betting operator sponsors a team, they know exactly how many people downloaded the app, placed a bet, and became customers. That attribution loop changes everything about sponsorship valuation.

---

**[CLOSING - 1:40-2:00]**

**SME:**
This week, you'll learn to think like both sides: the brand trying to prove ROI, and the betting operator who actually can. By Friday, you'll design an activation plan that answers the CFO's question with data, not hope.

## VIDEO #8 IO - Cohort - BOSM – W3-M1, V1 (Executive Perspective)

**Purpose:** Set executive expectations for the week
**Placement:** Module 1 (Welcome)
**Visual Style:** SME direct-to-camera

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]**

**SME:**
How do brands decide where to invest in sports sponsorships—and how do they measure success?

---

**[SECTION: ACTIVATION RULE - 0:15-0:45]**

**SME:**
A common mistake: thinking the rights fee is the investment. Wrong. For every $1 in rights fees, brands spend $2-3 on activation. If we pay $5 million to sponsor a team, we'll spend $10-15 million amplifying it through ads, hospitality, content, and retail.

The real question isn't "Can we afford the rights?"—it's "Can we activate at scale?"

---

**[SECTION: MEASUREMENT - 0:45-1:15]**

**SME:**
We measure three layers: Reach—how many people saw our brand? Engagement—did they interact? And Conversion—did they buy?

Reach is easy—broadcast impressions, social media views. Engagement requires data partnerships—app downloads, website visits. Conversion is hardest—tying sales to sponsorship exposure. That's where betting partnerships excel.

---

**[SECTION: BETTING ADVANTAGE - 1:15-1:45]**

**SME:**
When we partner with FanDuel or DraftKings, we access first-party data: who bet, what they bet on, when they converted. That attribution loop is impossible with traditional jersey sponsors.

Sports betting operators offer co-marketing deals where we share customer acquisition costs and conversion data. It's why betting-integrated sponsorships command 20-30% premiums.

---

**[CLOSING - 1:45-2:00]**

**SME:**
Your activation plan this week needs to answer: What's the reach? What's the engagement mechanism? How do we measure conversion? Think like a CFO, not just a marketer.

## VIDEO #9 IO - Cohort - BOSM – W3-M2, V1 (Sponsorship 101)

**Purpose:** Foundation concepts for sponsorship economics
**Placement:** Module 2 (Core Content)
**Visual Style:** SME with animated graphics

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]**

**[ANIMATION: FIFA World Cup logos with Coca-Cola]**

**SME:**
Why does Coca-Cola pay FIFA hundreds of millions to sponsor the World Cup? Because 3.5 billion people watch it—but that's not the whole story.

---

**[SECTION: COSTS - 0:15-0:45]**

**SME:**
Sponsorship has two costs: rights fees—what you pay the property—and activation costs—what you spend amplifying the partnership.

If a brand pays a property $300M per year in rights, they'll spend $600-900M in activation—ads during matches, retail displays, hospitality, branded content. The rights fee is just the entry ticket.

**[ON-SCREEN: "Rights Fee = Entry Ticket | Activation = 2-3x Rights"]**

---

**[SECTION: WHAT SPONSORS GET - 0:45-1:15]**

**SME:**
In exchange, sponsors receive three things. First, Reach—logo exposure across broadcasts, stadiums, digital. Second, Engagement—branded activations, hospitality, fan experiences. Third, Category exclusivity—major sponsors block competitors from the same tournament.

That exclusivity premium is worth 30-50% of the rights fee alone.

---

**[SECTION: CPM - 1:15-1:45]**

**SME:**
Brands measure sponsorship like advertising: cost per thousand impressions, or CPM. Premium sports advertising reaches $5,000-10,000 CPM. Sponsorship properties typically command lower CPMs based on frequency and context.

Why lower CPM? Frequency. Fans see a jersey sponsor 20-30 times per season. That repetition builds brand recall better than one-time ads.

---

**[CLOSING - 1:45-2:00]**

**SME:**
Next, you'll use the Sponsorship Valuation Calculator to model real deals. Input reach, frequency, and costs to calculate CPM and exposure value—the first step in ROI analysis.

## VIDEO #10 IO - Cohort - BOSM – W3-M3, V1 (Betting 101)

**Purpose:** Explain betting economics and attribution advantage
**Placement:** Module 3 (Interactive)
**Visual Style:** SME with data visualizations

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]**

**[ON-SCREEN: Key stats appearing]**

**SME:**
Sports bettors watch 40% more live sports than non-bettors. They engage 3x more on digital platforms. They spend 2x more on merchandise. That's why betting operators pay premium sponsorship rates.

---

**[SECTION: ENGAGEMENT VALUE - 0:15-0:45]**

**SME:**
Betting transforms passive viewers into active participants. When you have money on a game, every play matters. That engagement translates to longer viewing times, more ad exposure, and higher brand recall.

For sponsors, bettors are the ultimate target audience—engaged, affluent, and trackable.

---

**[SECTION: ATTRIBUTION - 0:45-1:15]**

**SME:**
Traditional sponsors struggle to prove ROI. How do you connect a jersey logo to shoe sales? Betting operators don't have this problem.

Every customer has an account. Every bet is tracked. When FanDuel or DraftKings sponsors the NBA, they know exactly how many customers came from broadcast exposure vs. social media vs. stadium signage. That attribution data is worth billions.

**[ON-SCREEN: "Full Attribution Loop: Exposure → Download → Bet → Lifetime Value"]**

---

**[SECTION: PREMIUM PRICING - 1:15-1:45]**

**SME:**
This is why betting sponsors pay 20-30% premiums over traditional sponsors. They're not just buying impressions—they're buying customers with measurable lifetime value.

A sports betting customer is worth $500-1,500 in lifetime revenue. If sponsorship drives 100,000 new customers, that's $50-150 million in value.

---

**[CLOSING - 1:45-2:00]**

**SME:**
Next, you'll use the Betting Economics Calculator to model customer acquisition costs, lifetime value, and the ROI of betting-integrated sponsorships.

## VIDEO #11 IO - Cohort - BOSM – W3-M4, V1 (FanDuel Case)

**Purpose:** Frame the case study analysis
**Placement:** Module 4 (Case Study)
**Visual Style:** SME direct-to-camera

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]**

**[ON-SCREEN: "Customer Acquisition Focus"]**

**SME:**
FanDuel and DraftKings entered the market aggressively following the 2018 Supreme Court decision that legalized sports betting across states. They pursued rapid expansion through substantial marketing investments and sponsorship partnerships.

---

**[SECTION: THE STRATEGY - 0:15-0:45]**

**SME:**
When sports betting legalized state-by-state starting in May 2018, operators faced a strategic choice: acquire customers now to establish market presence, or move cautiously and risk losing market share.

FanDuel and DraftKings chose aggressive expansion—spending heavily on customer acquisition to build first-mover advantage in new markets.

---

**[SECTION: PURE ACQUISITION - 0:45-1:15]**

**SME:**
FanDuel's sponsorship strategy focuses on market penetration and customer acquisition. Every NFL partnership, every stadium sponsorship, and every broadcast integration has a clear goal: drive customer adoption through increased visibility.

Unlike traditional sponsors measuring "brand awareness," betting operators measure cost-per-install and conversion metrics directly tied to business outcomes.

---

**[SECTION: THE DILEMMA - 1:15-1:45]**

**SME:**
Here's the case dilemma: What's the path to profitability? Aggressive market entry requires substantial investment. The question becomes: How do operators transition from customer acquisition to sustainable profitability?

Your analysis should evaluate unit economics and the factors that determine long-term viability in this market.

---

**[CLOSING - 1:45-2:00]**

**SME:**
As you read the FanDuel case, focus on customer economics: acquisition costs, lifetime value, retention rates, and the timeline to profitability. The AI Case Coach will help you analyze these metrics.
