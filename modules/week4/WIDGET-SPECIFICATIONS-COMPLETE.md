## Widget 1: Athlete Brand Calculator (Module 3)

### **Status:** ✅ Well-specified in storyboard, adding formulas below

### **Interface Design:**

**Top Section: Portfolio Allocation**
- 5 sliders, must total exactly $50M
- Real-time validation (budget constraint)
- Streams:
  1. Endorsements & Sponsorships
  2. Owned Businesses
  3. Investment Portfolio
  4. Media & Content Production
  5. Licensing & IP Rights

**Middle Section: Calculations Display**
- Year 1 Income (sum of all streams' Year 1 returns)
- Year 20 Wealth (cumulative with compounding)
- Line chart: Wealth trajectory (Y-axis: $M, X-axis: Years 1-20)
- Diversification Score: `100 - (σ of allocation percentages * 100)` where even split = 100
- Risk-Adjusted Return: `(Final Wealth - Initial Investment) / (σ of annual returns)`

**Bottom Section: Compare Your Strategy**
- User's allocation vs. 5 presets
- Display: Name, allocation breakdown, 20-year outcome

### **Calculation Formulas:**

**Annual Returns by Stream:**

```javascript
// Year 1-10 (active career)
endorsements_annual = allocation * 0.08 // 8% annual growth
owned_business_annual = allocation * 0.25 // 25% annual growth
investments_annual = allocation * 0.10 // 10% market returns
media_content_annual = allocation * 0.15 // 15% IP appreciation
licensing_annual = allocation * 0.12 // 12% passive income growth

// Year 11-20 (post-retirement)
endorsements_annual = previous_year * 0.92 // 8% annual DECLINE
owned_business_annual = previous_year * 1.25 // continues growing
investments_annual = previous_year * 1.10 // continues compounding
media_content_annual = previous_year * 1.15 // continues if IP-based
licensing_annual = previous_year * 1.12 // continues if owned IP
```

**Compounding Calculation:**
```javascript
for (year = 1; year <= 20; year++) {
  if (year <= 10) {
    wealth[year] = wealth[year-1] + sum(stream_returns_active)
  } else {
    wealth[year] = wealth[year-1] + sum(stream_returns_retired)
  }
}
```

**Diversification Score:**
```javascript
// Calculate standard deviation of allocation percentages
let allocations_pct = [
  endorsements/50, owned_business/50, investments/50,
  media_content/50, licensing/50
]
let mean = 0.20 // perfectly even = 20% each
let variance = allocations_pct.reduce((sum, x) => sum + Math.pow(x - mean, 2), 0) / 5
let std_dev = Math.sqrt(variance)
let diversification_score = Math.max(0, 100 - (std_dev * 500))
// Perfect diversification (20% each) = 100
// Total concentration (100% one stream) = 0
```

### **Investment Opportunities Data:**

```javascript
const investments = {
  nwsl: {
    name: "NWSL Franchise",
    entry_cost: 40000000,
    current_valuation: 40000000,
    default_growth: 0.25,
    default_risk: 0.10
  },
  wnba: {
    name: "WNBA Expansion Team",
    entry_cost: 50000000,
    current_valuation: 50000000,
    default_growth: 0.20,
    default_risk: 0.08
  },
  womens_soccer_eu: {
    name: "Women's Soccer Club (European)",
    entry_cost: 20000000,
    current_valuation: 20000000,
    default_growth: 0.30,
    default_risk: 0.12
  },
  pickleball: {
    name: "Pickleball Pro League Stake",
    entry_cost: 10000000,
    current_valuation: 10000000,

    current_valuation: 5000000,
    default_growth: 0.35,
    default_risk: 0.13
  }
}
```

### **Calculation Formulas:**

**Future Valuation:**
```javascript
let future_value = entry_cost * Math.pow(1 + growth_rate, time_horizon) * exit_multiple
```

**IRR Calculation:**
```javascript
// IRR is the rate r that solves: 0 = -entry_cost + future_value / (1+r)^time_horizon
// Simplified approximation:
let irr = (Math.pow(future_value / entry_cost, 1/time_horizon) - 1) * 100
```

**Risk-Adjusted Return (Sharpe Ratio):**
```javascript
let sharpe_ratio = (irr - 3.0) / risk_premium // 3% risk-free rate
```

**Comparison to Baselines:**
```javascript
let sp500_return = 0.10 // 10% annual
let sp500_risk = 0.05 // 5% volatility
let sp500_value = entry_cost * Math.pow(1.10, time_horizon)

let established_sports_return = 0.12 // 12% annual (MLS/NBA franchise)
let established_sports_risk = 0.06 // 6% volatility
let established_sports_value = entry_cost * Math.pow(1.12, time_horizon)

let outperformance_sp500 = ((future_value - sp500_value) / sp500_value) * 100
let outperformance_established = ((future_value - established_sports_value) / established_sports_value) * 100
```

**Break-Even Timeline:**
```javascript
// Year when cumulative returns = initial investment
let break_even_year = Math.log(entry_cost / entry_cost) / Math.log(1 + growth_rate)
// Simplified: years needed to double initial investment
let break_even = Math.log(2) / Math.log(1 + growth_rate)
```

**Sensitivity Analysis:**
```javascript
// Best Case: +50% growth, -30% risk, +2x exit multiple
let best_case_value = entry_cost * Math.pow(1 + growth_rate * 1.5, time_horizon) * (exit_multiple + 2)
let best_case_irr = (Math.pow(best_case_value / entry_cost, 1/time_horizon) - 1) * 100

// Base Case: user inputs
let base_case_value = future_value
let base_case_irr = irr

// Worst Case: -50% growth, +50% risk, -50% exit multiple
let worst_case_value = entry_cost * Math.pow(1 + growth_rate * 0.5, time_horizon) * (exit_multiple * 0.5)
let worst_case_irr = (Math.pow(worst_case_value / entry_cost, 1/time_horizon) - 1) * 100
```

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✓ YOUR PERSONALIZED STRATEGY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RECOMMENDED ALLOCATION:
60% Equity | 40% Endorsement

RATIONALE:
You're at peak brand value with moderate capital. This is
your window to build generational wealth. Take the $10M
endorsement deal for cash flow, but immediately invest
$6M in owned businesses (product line, equity stakes).
Use remaining $4M for lifestyle and risk mitigation.

SPECIFIC ACTION - CURRENT OFFER:
✓ Accept the $10M/year endorsement deal
✓ Negotiate for equity component (5-10% stake in brand)
✓ Use endorsement cash flow to fund $2M business investment
✓ Structure as: $10M endorsement + $2M equity investment

20-YEAR WEALTH PROJECTION:
Endorsement-only: $87M
Your strategy: $214M (+146% more wealth)

RISK ASSESSMENT:
Risk Level: Moderate
Mitigation: Diversify equity across 3-5 businesses, maintain
$4M cash reserve, keep endorsement income for stability

REAL ATHLETE WHO FOLLOWED THIS PATH:
LeBron James (2010-2015)
- Accepted Nike lifetime deal (endorsement cash flow)
- Invested in Blaze Pizza, SpringHill Entertainment (equity)
- Result: $1B+ net worth, businesses worth $500M+

## Widget 5: Post-Career Wealth Simulator (Module 4)

### **Status:** ⚠️ **PREVIOUSLY UNDERSPECIFIED** - Complete spec below

### **Widget Purpose:**
Multi-phase simulation showing how career-stage decisions compound to create dramatically different retirement wealth outcomes.

### **Interface Design:**

**Layout:** 3 vertical panels (one per phase) + output visualization at bottom

### **Phase 1: Rookie Years (Ages 22-26)**

**Given Variables (pre-set):**
- Salary progression: Year 1: $2M, Year 2: $2.5M, Year 3: $3M, Year 4: $4M, Year 5: $5M
- Total 5-year earnings: $16.5M

**User Decisions:**

**Decision 1: Lifestyle Spending**
- ○ Frugal (30% of income): Save $11.55M over 5 years
- ○ Moderate (50% of income): Save $8.25M over 5 years
- ○ Lavish (80% of income): Save $3.3M over 5 years

**Decision 2: Investment Strategy** (for saved money)
- ○ Conservative (Bonds - 4% annual return)
- ○ Balanced (60/40 stocks/bonds - 7% annual return)
- ○ Aggressive (100% stocks - 10% annual return)

**Phase 1 Output:**
- End of Year 5 Net Worth = Savings × (1 + return_rate)^years
- Frugal + Aggressive = $11.55M × 1.10^5 = $18.6M
- Lavish + Conservative = $3.3M × 1.04^5 = $4.0M

### **Phase 2: Peak Career (Ages 27-32)**

**Given Variables:**
- Salary progression: $10M, $15M, $20M, $22M, $25M, $25M
- Total 6-year earnings: $117M
- Starting net worth: (from Phase 1)
- Endorsement opportunity: $10M/year guaranteed OR invest $3M in owned business

**User Decisions:**

**Decision 1: Endorsement vs. Equity**
- ○ Take $10M/year endorsement (6 years = $60M guaranteed)
- ○ Invest $3M in owned business
  - Expected return: 25% annual growth
  - Exit Year 10 at 5x revenue multiple
  - Projected exit value: $3M × 1.25^10 × 5 = $140M

**Decision 2: Revenue Stream Allocation**
- Allocate $50M across 5 streams (using Athlete Brand Calculator logic)
- Pre-fill with user's choice from Decision 1:
  - If endorsement: $60M allocated to Endorsements
  - If equity: $3M allocated to Owned Businesses

**Decision 3: Lifestyle Spending**
- ○ Frugal (30%): Save $81.9M + Phase 1 assets
- ○ Moderate (50%): Save $58.5M + Phase 1 assets
- ○ Lavish (80%): Save $23.4M + Phase 1 assets

**Phase 2 Output:**
- End of Year 12 (Age 32) Net Worth = Phase 1 assets compounded + Phase 2 savings compounded + business valuations
- Best case (Frugal + Equity): $18.6M + $81.9M + $140M = $240.5M
- Worst case (Lavish + Endorsement): $4.0M + $23.4M + $0M = $27.4M

### **Phase 3: Retirement Transition (Ages 33-40)**

**Given Variables:**
- Playing salary: Declines to $0 by age 35
- Endorsement income: Declines 60-80% (based on Phase 2 choices)
- Starting net worth: (from Phase 2)
- Owned business valuations: Continue growing or available to sell
- Investment portfolio: Continues compounding

**User Decisions:**

**Decision 1: Business Exit Strategy**
- ○ Sell now (capture current valuation, get cash)
- ○ Hold for growth (continue 25% growth, more risk)

**Decision 2: Post-Career Venture**
- ○ Media/Broadcasting ($500K-$2M/year income)
- ○ Coaching/Front Office ($300K-$1M/year income)
- ○ Business Focus ($0 income, reinvest time in businesses)
- ○ Retirement (no new income, live off assets)

**Decision 3: Drawdown Strategy**
- ○ Preserve: Withdraw 4% annually (assets continue growing)
- ○ Balanced: Withdraw 7% annually (assets stable)
- ○ Aggressive: Withdraw 12% annually (depleting assets)

**Phase 3 Output:**
- End of Year 20 (Age 42) Net Worth
- Ages 42-65 projected wealth (if continue Phase 3 strategy)

**Income During Phase 3:**
```javascript
// Year 13-14 (ages 33-34): Declining salary
salary_33 = phase2_salary * 0.40 // $10M
salary_34 = phase2_salary * 0.10 // $2.5M

// Year 15+ (age 35+): No salary
salary_35_plus = 0

// Endorsements decline
if (phase2_choice === "endorsement") {
  endorsement_income = 10M * 0.30 // 70% decline = $3M/year
} else {
  endorsement_income = 0
}

// Owned businesses continue growing
if (decision1 === "hold") {
  business_value_annual = previous_value * 1.25
} else if (decision1 === "sell") {
  cash_from_sale = business_value

### **Output Visualization:**

**Wealth Trajectory Chart:**
- Line chart: X-axis = Age 22-65, Y-axis = Net Worth ($M)
- Three lines:
  1. User's path (based on choices)
  2. "Conservative Builder" comparison (frugal + balanced + preserve)
  3. "Lifestyle Trap" warning (lavish + endorsement + aggressive drawdown)

**Wealth Preservation Score (0-100):**
```javascript
let peak_net_worth = Math.max(...wealth_by_year)
let retirement_net_worth = wealth_at_age_65
let preservation_score = (retirement_net_worth / peak_net_worth) * 100

// 100 = retirement wealth equals or exceeds peak wealth (perfect preservation)
// 50 = retirement wealth is half of peak (moderate preservation)
// 0 = broke at retirement (complete depletion)
```

**Comparison Table:**

| Scenario | Age 32 (Peak) | Age 42 (Transition) | Age 65 (Retirement) | Preservation Score |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Your Path** | $240M | $287M | $412M | 95 |
| Conservative Builder | $156M | $198M | $334M | 100 |
| Lifestyle Trap | $27M | $18M | $0 (broke) | 0 |
| Magic Johnson (actual) | $48M | $180M | $1.2B+ | 200+ |

let equity_pct_serena = 0.70

if (equity_pct_user > equity_pct_serena + 0.10) {
  insight = "Your strategy is MORE aggressive than Serena's (${equity_pct_user*100}% equity vs her 70%). Higher risk, higher potential reward."
} else if (equity_pct_user < equity_pct_serena - 0.10) {
  insight = "Your strategy is MORE conservative than Serena's (${equity_pct_user*100}% equity vs her 70%). Lower risk, but less long-term wealth."
} else {
  insight = "Your strategy closely matches Serena's balanced approach (${equity_pct_user*100}% equity). Proven wealth-building allocation."
}
```

**Key Insights Displayed:**

1. **"Why 70% Equity?"**
   - Shows NPV calculation: $15M endorsements @ 8% growth = $87M (20 years)

2. **"When Did Serena Make These Decisions?"**
   - S by Serena launched 2018 (age 36, near retirement)
   - Serena Ventures launched 2014 (age 32, peak career)
