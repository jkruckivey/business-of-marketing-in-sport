# Welcome to Week 4: Athletes, Brands & Emerging Sports

Over the past three weeks, you've mastered the fundamentals of sports business revenue ecosystems (Week 1), analyzed how media rights and content drive fan engagement (Week 2), and explored the explosive growth of sponsorship and betting markets (Week 3). You understand how leagues, teams, and properties generate revenue.

This week, we shift focus to the **individual athlete** as a business. You'll discover how elite athletes like Serena Williams build $500 million brands that extend decades beyond their playing careers. You'll analyze the fastest-growing investment opportunity in sports: **women's sports** and **emerging sports properties**. And you'll learn why some athletes build generational wealth while others—despite earning tens of millions in salaries and endorsements—struggle financially after retirement.

**This week's central question:** How do elite athletes strategically build brands and businesses that create long-term wealth, not just short-term income?

By Friday, you'll be able to answer that question—and you'll apply it to your Anchor Project's strategic recommendations.

# What You'll Be Able to Do by Friday

Professional sports presents unique strategic challenges at the individual athlete level that traditional business frameworks don't fully address. By the end of this week, you'll be able to solve four complex problems:

---

## **MLO 4.1: Analyze the Five Athlete Revenue Streams**

### What You'll Master:
You'll be able to identify and analyze the five major revenue streams elite athletes use to build wealth: (1) endorsements and sponsorships, (2) owned businesses and ventures, (3) investment portfolios, (4) media and content production, and (5) licensing and intellectual property. More importantly, you'll understand which streams create **equity-based wealth** (owned assets that appreciate) versus **fee-based income** (one-time payments).

### Success Criteria:
**You can do this when you can:**
- Map all five athlete revenue streams with specific examples (e.g., LeBron's SpringHill Entertainment = media/content, Serena Ventures = investments)
- Distinguish between fee-based income (endorsement contracts) and equity-based wealth (ownership stakes)
- Explain why Michael Jordan earns more from Nike royalties ($130M/year) than he earned in his entire playing career ($93M total)
- Calculate the long-term value difference between a $10M endorsement deal and a $2M investment in an owned business
- Recommend which revenue streams an athlete should prioritize at different career stages (rookie year vs. peak earnings vs. retirement transition)

### Why This Matters:
Most athletes chase endorsement deals because they offer immediate cash. But endorsements are fee-based income that stop when relevance fades. Owned businesses and investments create equity that compounds over decades. Understanding this distinction is the difference between earning $100M in a career and building $500M in generational wealth.

---

## **MLO 4.2: Evaluate Owned Asset Strategy vs. Endorsement Strategy**

### What You'll Master:
You'll be able to evaluate strategic trade-offs between taking endorsement fees versus investing in owned businesses. You'll understand when an athlete should endorse Nike for $10M versus invest $2M to launch their own athletic wear brand. You'll analyze why athletes like Serena Williams, LeBron James, and Roger Federer increasingly prioritize ownership over endorsements—and why that strategy requires different risk profiles, capital requirements, and timelines.

### Success Criteria:
**You can do this when you can:**
- Calculate the 20-year NPV difference between a $10M endorsement deal and a $2M owned business investment (assuming growth rates, exit multiples, and risk-adjusted returns)
- Explain why Michael Jordan's Nike royalty deal (percentage of Air Jordan sales) creates more value than any fixed endorsement contract
- Identify which athletes are good candidates for owned businesses (peak brand value, access to capital, long time horizon) versus endorsements (lower brand value, need immediate income, short career window)
- Analyze Serena Williams' S by Serena clothing line decision: Why launch an owned brand instead of endorsing Nike/Adidas for guaranteed fees?
- Design a 10-year brand strategy that balances endorsement income (to fund lifestyle and investments) with owned business development (to build equity)

### Why This Matters:
The highest-earning retired athletes all share one strategy: they built owned assets during their playing careers. George Foreman earned more from his grill business ($200M) than from boxing. Magic Johnson built a business empire (movie theatres, Starbucks franchises, life insurance) worth $1.2B. LeBron's SpringHill Entertainment is valued at $750M. These athletes understood that endorsement checks are limited—but equity compounds forever.

---

## **MLO 4.3: Assess Women's Sports and Emerging Sports Investment Opportunities**

### What You'll Master:
You'll be able to assess why women's sports and emerging sports properties represent the highest-growth investment opportunities in sports business today. You'll understand the investment thesis: women's sports are growing 300% faster than men's despite being valued at 1/10th the price, creating massive arbitrage opportunities for early investors. You'll analyze case studies (NWSL expansion, WNBA growth, women's soccer, women's tennis, pickleball, esports) to understand what drives returns.

### Success Criteria:
**You can do this when you can:**
- Explain the women's sports investment thesis: Why invest in NWSL franchises (valued at $40M) when MLS franchises cost $500M—and why NWSL may offer better ROI
- Calculate the growth rate difference: NWSL attendance +48% (2022-2023), MLS attendance +7%—and explain why first movers capture disproportionate returns
- Analyze valuation gaps: Why is the WNBA valued at $1B (entire league) when NBA teams average $3B each (single team)—and whether this represents opportunity or risk
- Evaluate emerging sports: Pickleball, women's rugby, women's cricket, Ultimate Frisbee—using criteria like growth rate, professionalization timeline, media rights potential, and demographic trends
- Recommend whether an investor should buy an NWSL expansion franchise ($40M today) or wait for valuations to stabilize—with supporting evidence on growth trajectory and comparable exits

### Why This Matters:
The biggest investment returns come from buying undervalued assets before the market catches up. In 2015, NWSL franchises sold for $3M. Today they're $40-50M (13x return in 8 years). Investors who saw the women's sports growth trend early made generational returns. The same opportunity exists today in women's sports and emerging sports—but the window is closing as more capital flows in. Understanding how to evaluate these opportunities is the skill that separates good investors from great ones.

---

## **MLO 4.4: Design Post-Career Transition Strategies for Athletes**

### What You'll Master:
You'll be able to design comprehensive post-career transition strategies that maximize athlete brand value after retirement. You'll understand that athlete brand value typically declines 60-80% within 5 years of retirement—unless they've built assets that sustain value independent of playing career. You'll analyze Serena Williams' post-career strategy (Serena Ventures $111M investment fund, S by Serena clothing line, board positions) to understand how elite athletes transition from playing to business.

### Success Criteria:
**You can do this when you can:**
- Identify which athlete assets maintain value post-retirement (owned businesses, investments, media production companies) versus which assets depreciate (endorsements tied to playing career, appearance fees, autograph signings)
- Explain why athlete brand value declines post-retirement: Relevance fades, media attention drops, endorsement contracts expire—and how to mitigate this decline
- Analyze Serena Williams' Serena Ventures strategy: $111M fund investing in companies founded by women and people of color—why this creates post-career value beyond financial returns (board seats, network access, legacy building)
- Design a 10-year transition plan for an athlete at peak career (age 28): What assets to build NOW (during high brand value) that will generate value for 40 years post-retirement
- Calculate the wealth preservation difference: Athlete A earns $100M in career, spends $80M, retires with $20M. Athlete B earns $100M, invests $40M in businesses during career, retires with $60M that compounds to $200M+ over 20 years. Why does the difference occur?

### Why This Matters:
78% of NFL players are broke within 3 years of retirement. 60% of NBA players are broke within 5 years. The reason isn't lack of earnings—many made tens of millions. The reason is they treated their playing career as a job (earn salary, spend salary) instead of a wealth-building window (invest during peak brand value, build assets that compound post-retirement). Understanding post-career strategy is the difference between temporary prosperity and generational wealth.

## How These Outcomes Connect

These four outcomes build on each other:

1. **First, you learn the five revenue streams** (MLO 4.1) so you know all the options available to athletes
2. **Then, you learn to evaluate owned assets vs. endorsements** (MLO 4.2) so you understand which streams create long-term wealth
3. **Next, you learn to assess women's sports and emerging sports opportunities** (MLO 4.3) so you can identify high-growth investment areas
4. **Finally, you design post-career transition strategies** (MLO 4.4) that synthesize everything—building assets during playing career that sustain wealth for decades

By Friday, you'll apply all four capabilities to analyze Serena Williams' brand strategy and recommend how athletes should build generational wealth in today's market.

# How Week 4 Connects to Your Anchor Project Milestone 3

## Milestone 3: Implementation Roadmap (Due End of Week 4)

This week, you'll complete **Milestone 3** of your Anchor Project: the **Implementation Roadmap**. This milestone requires you to design a detailed 12-18 month execution plan for your sports business opportunity, including:

- Resource allocation across revenue streams
- Strategic partnerships and key stakeholders
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Financial projections and funding requirements

**Week 4's learning directly supports Milestone 3:**

**MLO 4.1 (Five Revenue Streams):**
- Apply to your Implementation Roadmap's revenue model
- Map which revenue streams your opportunity will prioritize
- Distinguish fee-based income vs. equity-based wealth creation
- Example: If your Anchor Project involves athlete partnerships, MLO 4.1 helps you structure endorsement deals vs. equity partnerships

**MLO 4.2 (Owned Assets vs. Endorsements):**
- Apply to your strategic partnership decisions
- Evaluate whether your opportunity should pursue licensing deals (fee-based) or joint ventures (equity-based)
- Example: Should your sports tech startup license IP to teams, or build owned products and retain equity?

**MLO 4.3 (Women's Sports & Emerging Sports):**
- Apply to your growth opportunity analysis
- If your project involves women's sports or emerging sports, use MLO 4.3's investment thesis framework to justify projections
- Cite growth rates, valuation trends, and comparable deals to support your financial forecasts
- Example: If launching a women's sports media property, cite NWSL's 48% attendance growth and $240M valuation to justify revenue projections

**MLO 4.4 (Post-Career Transition):**
- Apply to your long-term value creation strategy
- Design how your opportunity creates sustained value beyond initial launch
- Example: If building an athlete brand platform, design post-career services that retain value after athletes retire

**Practical Application:**
Your Week 4 case analysis (Serena Williams) becomes a **proven framework** you adapt for your Anchor Project:

- Serena's five revenue streams → Map to your opportunity's revenue model
- Serena's owned businesses strategy → Inform your partnership and equity structure decisions
- Serena Ventures' women's sports focus → Justify your growth opportunity if applicable
- Serena's post-career assets → Design your long-term value sustainability plan

**Deliverable Integration:**
When you submit Milestone 3 at the end of Week 4, you'll reference this week's frameworks explicitly:

> "Following Serena Williams' owned asset strategy (Week 4 Case), we recommend structuring partnerships as equity joint ventures rather than licensing agreements. This approach builds long-term enterprise value..."

> "Our women's sports investment thesis draws on Week 4's MLO 4.3 framework: NWSL franchises grew from $3M (2015) to $40M+ (2023), demonstrating 13x returns for first movers..."

Week 4 isn't just theory—it's the strategic toolkit you'll apply to your Anchor Project's implementation plan this week.

## Module 1 Complete - Transition to Module 2

**What You've Accomplished:**
You now understand exactly what you'll be able to do by Friday. You have four clear, measurable learning outcomes—and you know how they connect to each other and to your Anchor Project. You're not just learning about athlete brands abstractly; you're building strategic capabilities you'll apply to real business problems.

**Key Insight:**
The highest-earning retired athletes all share one strategy: they built equity-based assets during their playing careers. Endorsements provide income, but ownership builds wealth. This week, you'll learn to design strategies that create generational wealth, not just career earnings.

**Up Next: Module 2 - Executive Perspectives**
Now that you know what you're learning and why it matters, you'll hear from practitioners who've actually done this work: a sports agent who represents elite athletes, Don Rea from the PGA Tour navigating golf's global expansion, and experts in women's sports investment and athlete brand building. Their insights will ground the frameworks you're about to learn.

Ready to hear from the experts? Let's go!
