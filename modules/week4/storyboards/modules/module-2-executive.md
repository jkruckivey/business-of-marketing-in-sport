## Element 1: Connecting Introduction Text

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Text** element
2. Copy markdown below:

```markdown
You now understand the four learning outcomes that will transform how you analyze athlete brands and emerging sports opportunities. You know that elite athletes must balance five revenue streams, prioritize equity over fees, and build post-career assets during their playing years.

Before exploring the frameworks in depth, you need context from practitioners who've actually built athlete brands, negotiated endorsement deals, and invested in women's sports and emerging markets. In this module, you'll hear from:

- **A sports agent** who represents elite athletes and structures multi-million dollar endorsement deals
- **Don Rea**, Chief Commercial Officer of the PGA Tour, discussing golf's global expansion into emerging markets
- **Women's sports investment experts** who are capitalizing on the fastest-growing segment of sports business

Their insights will ground the theory you're about to explore in Module 3 with real-world trade-offs, strategic decisions, and lessons learned from the field.

**Video Title:** "Five Athlete Revenue Streams"
**Video Caption:** "2-minute overview of endorsements, owned businesses, investments, media/content, and licensing"

### FULL SCRIPT:

```
[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]
[ON-SCREEN: Five revenue stream icons appearing]

NARRATOR:
Elite athletes today have access to five distinct revenue streams. Understanding these
streams—and which ones create long-term wealth—is essential for building generational value.

Let's break them down.

---

[SECTION: THE FIVE STREAMS - 0:15-1:45]
[ANIMATION: Each stream appears with example]

NARRATOR:
Stream #1: Endorsements & Sponsorships (Fee-Based Income)
Nike pays LeBron James $30M/year to endorse their products. This is traditional endorsement
income—substantial, but it's a fee. When the contract ends, the income stops.

Stream #2: Owned Businesses (Equity-Based Wealth)
Serena Williams launches S by Serena, her own clothing line. She owns 100% equity. If the
business grows to $100M valuation, she captures 100% of that value. This is wealth building,
not just income.

Stream #3: Investment Portfolios (Compounding Returns)
Serena Ventures: $111M fund investing in startups founded by women and people of color.
Investments compound over time. LeBron's early investment in Blaze Pizza turned $1M into
$40M+.

Stream #4: Media & Content Production (IP Ownership)
LeBron's SpringHill Entertainment produces films and TV shows. Valued at $750M. The IP
he creates generates revenue indefinitely—unlike playing basketball, which ends at retirement.

Stream #5: Licensing & Intellectual Property (Passive Income)
Michael Jordan's Nike royalty deal: He earns $130M/year from Air Jordan sales—more than his
entire playing career earnings ($93M total). This is the power of IP licensing.

---

[CONCLUSION - 1:45-2:00]
[ANIMATION: Five streams with distinction: Income vs. Wealth]

NARRATOR:
Key insight: Streams 1-2 provide income. Streams 2-5 build wealth. The highest-earning retired
athletes prioritize equity and ownership over fee-based endorsements.

Successful athletes build wealth engines, not just income streams.

## 🎯 FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION

**How Module 2 Supports Your Final Strategic Vision:**

Module 2 delivered practitioner insights from sports agents, PGA executives, and women's sports experts. This real-world perspective grounds your Week 5 athlete partnership strategy in operational reality.

**What You Learned:**
- Sports agents structure deals to maximize athlete equity, not just endorsement fees
- Global expansion (PGA's model) requires understanding local markets, cultural dynamics, and infrastructure gaps
- Women's sports experts see 300% faster growth than men's sports despite 1/10th the valuation—massive arbitrage opportunity
- Athlete brand building requires 10-year thinking, not quarterly thinking

**How to Apply This to Your Final Project:**

When you design your 5-year strategic vision in Week 5, reference Module 2's executive frameworks:

- **Athlete Partnership Strategy:** If your property involves athlete deals, cite the sports agent framework. Example: "Following Week 4's agent model, we offer athletes equity stakes (5-10% of merchandise revenue) vs. flat endorsement fees, aligning long-term incentives."
- **Global Expansion:** If your property has international ambitions, apply PGA's expansion framework from Module 2. Don Rea taught you to assess market readiness, not just market size.
- **Women's Sports Positioning:** If your property targets women's sports, reference Module 2's expert insights to justify growth projections and valuation premiums.

**Real-World Application:** The executives you heard from evaluate athlete partnerships and market opportunities daily. Your Week 5 capstone will undergo similar scrutiny—Module 2 taught you how practitioners defend athlete brand strategies.
