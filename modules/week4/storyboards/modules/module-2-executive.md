You now understand the four learning outcomes that will transform how you analyze athlete brands and emerging sports opportunities. You know that elite athletes must balance five revenue streams, prioritize equity over fees, and build post-career assets during their playing years.

Before exploring the frameworks in depth, you need context from a practitioner who's actually built an emerging sports business from scratch. In this module, you'll hear from:

- **Matt Rubinoff**, Co-Founder, Fairgrounds - discussing the explosive growth of emerging sports (pickleball/paddle), community-based brand building, scaling from concept to 75,000 members across 11 locations, and the opportunity in underserved sports markets

His insights will ground the theory you're about to explore in Module 3 with real-world trade-offs, strategic decisions, and lessons learned from building a national sports brand.

*Note: You heard from Kevin Abrams (NY Giants) in Week 1 on sports business operations, and you'll hear from Golf Canada's leadership in Week 5 on future trends and legacy sports.*

Title: ◉ Executive Insights: Building an Emerging Sports Brand

This module features a full executive interview with Matt Rubinoff, co-founder of Fairgrounds, who built a national pickleball/paddle brand from zero to 75,000 members in just 3 years.

**Matt Rubinoff (Fairgrounds, ~38 min)** - Co-founder discusses building a national pickleball/paddle brand from zero to 75,000 members across 11 locations, the "white space" between public and private clubs, scaling through vacant retail spaces, intentional brand/marketing focus (vs. traditional club operators), and why emerging sports offer first-mover advantages.

**Viewing Guide:**
- Watch for proof-of-concept methodology (5 courts → 7K members in 3 months, zero marketing)
- Note the brand differentiation strategy (marketing-first team vs. club operators)
- Consider the geographic expansion logic (data-driven market selection)
- Observe the emerging sport assessment framework (wide demographic + accessibility + high ceiling)

This interview directly supports WLO 4.3 (emerging opportunities) and WLO 4.4 (brand building).

**Total viewing time:** ~38 minutes

**Duration:** ~38 minutes
**Transcript:** `Interviews/Matt R, Transcript.txt`
**Video Title:** "Matt Rubinoff: Building a National Pickleball Brand from Zero to 75K Members"
**Video Caption:** "Fairgrounds co-founder on emerging sports growth, brand differentiation, and scaling across 11 locations"

### Interview Content - Key Topics Covered:

**10-Year-Old Matt (00:00-01:06)** - Curious troublemaker, athlete, sports-obsessed, not much has changed

**What is Fairgrounds (01:27-03:29)** - Public racquet club (pickleball/paddle), solving "white space" between unusable public facilities and exclusive private clubs with initiation fees/dress codes, focus on accessibility and community

**Brand & Lifestyle Vision (03:57-07:26)** - Co-founder Drummond Mun roe (cannabis brand Suprette background), recognized wide demographic playing pickleball (16-year-olds with 75-year-olds), accessibility like ping pong but high skill ceiling, 75K members across 5 locations (6 more opening in 3 months)

**Proof of Concept to Scale (08:06-12:38)** - Built 5-court Best Buy site at Yonge/Eglinton, 7,000 members in 3 months with zero marketing (utilization through the roof), validated demand, shifted from temporary outdoor to permanent indoor locations for year-round operation and term certainty

**Competitive Differentiation (13:29-17:20)** - Brand/community/aesthetic vs. franchise operators, colorful fun environments vs. sterile courts, marketing-first team (not racquet sports operators), Swedish paddle brand acquisition (clean design vs. "energy drink for 14-year-old boy")

**Intentional Scaling Strategy (17:20-20:18)** - First-mover advantage critical (many clubs opened last year), data-driven market analysis (demographics, comparables like rec rooms), GTA + Kingston/Ottawa + Alberta/BC expansion, regional managers to support quality control across geographies

**Pickleball vs. Paddle (20:29-23:01)** - Pickleball = NASCAR (North American phenomenon), Paddle = F1 (international sport), paddle more physical but still accessible, switching from tennis to paddle (personally addicted), both invented in 60s/70s but different growth trajectories

**Business Model & Revenue (28:38-33:02)** - Court utilization as key metric, public model (not capped membership), learning customer spend patterns/frequency, difficult booking platforms (on 3rd vendor), events/sponsorships/programming (singles nights with Tinder partnership), brand protection critical for partnerships

**5-Year Vision (33:39-36:01)** - Scale across Canada (no immediate US plans - many failed cross-border), independent operators struggling (acquisition targets), brand allows expansion beyond racquet sports (basketball, golf simulators, but focus prevents confusion for now)

**10-Year Personal Outlook (36:31-37:11)** - Hopes to be on court playing at 80 (like his mom), strategic high-level work vs. operational, more court time as reward

**Career Advice for Emerging Sports (23:51-28:05)** - Assess if trend is flash-in-pan vs. has legs, pickleball's wide demographic + high ceiling = staying power, proof of concept critical (get feedback), understand accessibility/year-round viability/market size, business model must make money (events? product? community?), protect what makes it unique for eventual sale/scale

**Viewing Guide for Students:**
- Proof of Concept Methodology: 5 courts, 3 months, 7K members, zero marketing = validated demand
- Brand as Differentiator: Marketing team first, not club operators (opposite of competition)
- White Space Identification: Between unusable public and inaccessible private - underserved market
- Geographic Expansion: Data-driven (demographics, comparables), regional managers for quality
- Revenue Model: Open membership (not capped), court utilization, programming, partnerships
- Emerging Sport Assessment: Wide demographic + accessibility + high ceiling = legs vs. flash-in-pan

## Matt Rubinoff - Co-Founder, Fairgrounds

**Full Transcript:** See `Interviews/Matt R, Transcript.txt`

**Bio:**
Matt Rubinoff is co-founder of Fairgrounds, a public racquet club brand that has grown from concept to 75,000 members across 11 locations in just 3 years. Fairgrounds focuses on emerging racquet sports (pickleball and paddle), targeting the "white space" between unusable public facilities and exclusive private clubs with prohibitive membership costs.

Prior to Fairgrounds, Matt founded Stackt Market (stylized as "Stacked"), an innovative shipping container-based retail and community space in Toronto that activated temporary land through experiential retail, food, and events. This experience taught him temporary land activation strategies that informed Fairgrounds' initial model, though the company has since evolved to permanent indoor locations with long-term leases.

**Career Highlights:**
- Built Fairgrounds from 0 to 75,000 members in 3 years
- Scaled from 1 proof-of-concept location (5 courts, 7K members in 3 months, zero marketing) to 11 locations across Canada
- 6 additional locations opening in next 3 months (GTA, Kingston, Ottawa, Alberta, BC)
- Acquired Swedish paddle racket brand for product/design integration
- Partnership with Tinder for singles night programming (creative brand activations)
- Pioneered "marketing-first" approach vs. traditional club operators

**Industry Expertise:**
- Emerging sports market assessment (flash-in-pan vs. sustainable growth)
- Proof-of-concept methodology and rapid validation
- Brand building and community development
- Geographic expansion strategy (data-driven market selection)
- Revenue model optimization (court utilization, programming, partnerships)
- Competitive differentiation through brand/aesthetic/experience

**Fairgrounds Portfolio:**
- 11 current locations (5 operating, 6 opening in 3 months)
- 75,000+ members
- Pickleball and paddle (padel) courts
- National expansion: Ontario (GTA, Kingston, Ottawa), Alberta, British Columbia
- Future considerations: Basketball courts, golf simulators, other racquet sports

**What You've Learned:**
You've heard from Matt Rubinoff, who built Fairgrounds from zero to 75,000 members in just 3 years. His practical experience in emerging sports demonstrates how to identify market opportunities, validate demand through proof of concept, and scale through brand differentiation rather than operational expertise.

**Key Takeaways:**
- **Proof of concept before scale** - Fairgrounds: 5 courts → 7K members in 3 months with $0 marketing = validated demand
- **Marketing-first beats operational expertise** - Fairgrounds hired marketers who love sports, not club operators stuck in "archaic" models
- **White space identification** - Emerging opportunities exist between unusable public options and exclusive private clubs
- **Emerging sport viability** - Wide demographic + accessibility + high skill ceiling = staying power (vs. flash-in-pan)
- **Data-driven expansion** - Geographic growth based on demographics and comparables, not gut instinct
