## Element 4: Strategy Snapshot

| Decision | What She Did | What Most Athletes Do | Why It Matters |

| Revenue Mix | ~30% endorsements, ~70% equity | ~90% endorsements, ~10% equity | Equity compounds; fees don't |
| S by Serena (2018) | Launched own clothing line | Would take bigger Nike deal | Owns 100% vs. 5% endorsement fee |
| Serena Ventures (2014) | $111M fund, 85+ companies | Would hire wealth manager | Controls capital deployment |
| Timing | Built businesses WHILE playing | Waits until retirement | Had momentum when she transitioned |
| Investment thesis | Women/POC founders (2% of VC) | Generic diversification | Exploited market inefficiency |

- Tonal (invested 2019, valued $1.6B in 2021) → 30x return
- Daily Harvest (invested 2016, valued $1.1B in 2021) → 40x return

**Fund Performance:**
- IRR: Estimated 25-35% (VC benchmark: 15-20%)
