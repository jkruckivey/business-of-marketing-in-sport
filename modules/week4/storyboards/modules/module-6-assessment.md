# From Analysis to Strategy: Your Turn to Build an Athlete Brand

You've mastered the frameworks. You've experimented with simulations. You've analyzed Serena Williams' actual strategy. Now it's time to demonstrate what you've learned by solving a real strategic problem.


### The Challenge

An elite 25-year-old athlete has hired you as their brand strategist. They have:
- 10-year peak career ahead (ages 25-35)
- Current salary: $5M/year, growing to $15M/year at peak
- Strong brand appeal but limited business experience
- Goal: Build generational wealth ($200M+ net worth by age 50)

They've seen too many athletes go broke after retirement. They want YOUR strategic plan to avoid that fate.

### Your Task

Write a 1200-1500 word **Strategic Brand Memo** that:
1. Maps their optimal revenue stream allocation across 10 years
2. Recommends owned business vs. endorsement strategy with financial justification
3. Identifies 2-3 specific investment opportunities (women's sports? emerging markets?)
4. Designs post-career transition plan that preserves wealth after retirement

Use Week 4 frameworks, cite Serena Williams case insights, and provide specific financial projections.

**This assessment demonstrates mastery of all 4 Week 4 learning outcomes.**

Let's show what you can do.

Allow 120-180 minutes for planning (45 min), writing and analysis (60-90 min), and revision (15-30 min). Your memo must include revenue stream allocation with percentages, owned versus endorsed asset strategy with NPV analysis, 2-3 investment opportunities with IRR projections, and post-career transition plan. Cite Serena Williams case insights and provide supporting financial projections. External research is not required. Review the rubric before writing.

**⏱️ Time Investment Breakdown:**
- Case review and note-taking: 30-45 min
- Planning and outline: 15-20 min
- Writing (all 4 sections): 60-90 min
- Calculations and tables: 15-20 min

```markdown
# Assessment Prompt: Athlete Brand Strategy Memo

## Scenario

**Client:** Jordan Taylor, 25-year-old elite athlete (you choose sport)

**Current Situation:**
- Professional career: 3 years (ages 22-25)
- Current salary: $5M/year
- Peak salary projection: $15M/year (ages 28-32)
- Career length estimate: 10 years peak performance remaining (ages 25-35)
- Current endorsements: $2M/year (Nike, Gatorade, regional sponsors)
- Current net worth: $8M (saved aggressively during rookie years)
- Risk tolerance: Moderate (willing to invest in growth but values some security)

**Client's Goal:**
"I've seen too many athletes go broke after retirement. I want to build generational wealth—$200M+ net worth by age 50—so my family is financially secure forever. Help me design a 10-year strategy that achieves this goal."

**Client's Questions for You:**
1. How should I allocate my time, capital, and brand equity across the five revenue streams over the next 10 years?
2. When should I take endorsement deals vs. invest in owned businesses? What's the financial trade-off?
3. Should I invest in women's sports or emerging markets? Which opportunities offer best returns?
4. What assets should I build NOW (during playing career) that will sustain wealth after retirement?

## Element 6: AI Roleplay - Practice Pitch (Optional)

**Purpose:** Students practice presenting their strategy to athlete client before submitting final memo

### Student-Facing Instructions (Place as Text element BEFORE AI Roleplay)

```markdown
### Practice Your Pitch
Before submitting your final memo, practice presenting your strategy to your athlete client, Jordan Taylor. This optional roleplay helps you test clarity, field questions, and ensure your recommendations are defensible.

**Your Goal:** Summarize your key recommendations and respond to Jordan's questions. This is practice—not graded. Use this to refine your final memo.

**Conversation Length:** 4-5 exchanges
```

### UPLIMIT CONFIGURATION

**Tab 1: Learning Objective**

**Widget Name:** Practice Pitch: Present Your Strategy to Jordan Taylor

**Learning Objective:**
```
Students will practice presenting their athlete brand strategy verbally to the client (Jordan Taylor) before submitting their written memo. This optional roleplay helps students refine their recommendations by:

1. Testing clarity of strategic recommendations
2. Fielding realistic client questions about financial projections
3. Ensuring trade-offs and risks have been considered
4. Building confidence in their analysis before final submission

Success = Student can articulate their strategy clearly and respond to probing questions with evidence-based reasoning.
```

**Scenario Setup:** Practice/Formative (optional, not graded)

---

**Tab 2: Scenario**

**Context:**
```
Jordan Taylor (the learner's athlete client) has read the draft strategy memo. Jordan has scheduled a 10-minute meeting to ask clarifying questions before the memo is finalized. The learner will present key recommendations and respond to Jordan's concerns about revenue streams, financial projections, and risk mitigation. This practice conversation helps the learner refine their final written submission.
```

**Role of AI (Jordan Taylor):**
```
A 25-year-old elite athlete who hired the learner as their brand strategist. Jordan is thoughtful and business-minded but not an expert in finance, asking clarifying questions like a smart client would.
```

**Role of Student:**
```
The learner plays the role of a brand strategist presenting their athlete brand strategy recommendations to their client, Jordan Taylor, summarizing key recommendations and responding to questions.
```

---

**Tab 3: Hidden Context**

```
**AI Character Context:**
You are Jordan Taylor, a 25-year-old elite athlete reviewing the student's brand strategy memo. You're smart and engaged but not a finance expert—ask questions a thoughtful client would ask.

**Questions to Ask (adapt based on student responses):**

1. **Revenue Streams:** "You recommend I put 40% into owned businesses. Which businesses specifically? Why those?"

2. **Financial Projections:** "You project I'll have $200M by age 50. How did you calculate that? What assumptions did you make about growth rates?"

3. **Trade-offs:** "If I invest $3M in a business, where does that capital come from? Do I take less endorsement money? Borrow?"

4. **Risk Mitigation:** "What if my career ends early due to injury? Does this strategy still work?"

5. **Women's Sports Investment:** "You mention investing in women's sports. Which specific opportunities? What's the timeline for returns?"

6. **Post-Career Transition:** "I'm 25 now. When should I start building these post-career assets? Can I wait until I'm 30?"

**AI Personality Traits:**
- Curious and engaged: You want to understand the reasoning behind recommendations
- Business-minded: You care about returns but aren't a finance expert
- Realistic: You have concerns about risk, capital requirements, and career uncertainty
- Appreciative: You value the strategist's expertise and want actionable advice

**Conversation Strategy:**
1. Let student present their opening summary without interruption
2. Ask 2-3 probing questions based on what they present
3. Express one realistic concern (injury, timing, capital)
4. After 4-5 exchanges: "Thanks for walking me through this. I feel more confident about the strategy. Go ahead and finalize the memo—I think we're on the right track."

**Success Indicators:**
- ✅ Student articulates strategy clearly
- ✅ Student supports recommendations with evidence from Week 4 content
- ✅ Student addresses trade-offs and risks thoughtfully
```

**Tab 4: Criteria**

**Grading:** Not graded (optional practice - completion credit only)

No evaluation criteria. This is optional practice to help students refine their final memo submission. Students who complete the roleplay receive completion credit.

## Element 7: Details - Assessment FAQs

```markdown
Title: Assessment FAQs

[Expand for common questions]

**Q: Can I choose any sport for Jordan Taylor?**
A: Yes. Choose a sport you're familiar with so you can make realistic assumptions about salary progression and brand opportunities.

**Q: Do I need to do external research?**
A: No. Use only Week 4 content (modules, widgets, case study). Everything you need is provided.

**Q: How detailed should financial projections be?**
A: Show your work, but don't over-complicate. Use realistic assumptions (growth rates, discount rates, exit multiples) based on Week 4 frameworks. Tables are helpful but not required.

**Q: Can I use the widget results in my memo?**
A: Yes! Reference specific outputs from Athlete Brand Calculator or Emerging Sports Investment Tool to support your recommendations.

**Q: What if my projections don't reach exactly $200M at age 50?**
A: That's OK. Show a realistic path. If you project $180M, acknowledge the gap and explain what additional strategies could close it.

**Q: Should I cite sources?**
A: Cite the Serena Williams case and Week 4 modules when referencing specific data or frameworks, but formal citations aren't required. Example: "Following Serena Williams' strategy (Week 4 Case), I recommend..."

**Q: Can I get feedback before final submission?**
A: Use the AI Roleplay (Element 6) to practice your pitch and identify weak points. Peer discussion is encouraged (but write your own memo).

**Q: What happens if I go over 1500 words?**
A: Slight variance is OK (up to 1600 words). Significantly exceeding word count suggests lack of editing discipline—be concise and strategic.
