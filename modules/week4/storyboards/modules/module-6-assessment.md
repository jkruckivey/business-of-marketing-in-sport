# From Analysis to Strategy: Your Turn to Build an Athlete Brand

You've mastered the frameworks. You've experimented with simulations. You've analyzed Serena Williams' actual strategy. Now it's time to demonstrate what you've learned by solving a real strategic problem.

### The Challenge

An elite 25-year-old athlete has hired you as their brand strategist. They have:
- 10-year peak career ahead (ages 25-35)
- Current salary: $5M/year, growing to $15M/year at peak
- Strong brand appeal but limited business experience
- Goal: Build generational wealth ($200M+ net worth by age 50)

They've seen too many athletes go broke after retirement. They want YOUR strategic plan to avoid that fate.

### Your Task

Write a 1200-1500 word **Strategic Brand Memo** that:
1. Maps their optimal revenue stream allocation across 10 years
2. Recommends owned business vs. endorsement strategy with financial justification
3. Identifies 2-3 specific investment opportunities (women's sports? emerging markets?)
4. Designs post-career transition plan that preserves wealth after retirement

Use Week 4 frameworks, cite Serena Williams case insights, and provide specific financial projections.

**This assessment demonstrates mastery of all 4 Week 4 learning outcomes.**

Let's show what you can do.

# Assessment Prompt: Athlete Brand Strategy Memo

## Scenario

**Client:** Jordan Taylor, 25-year-old elite athlete (you choose sport)

**Current Situation:**
- Professional career: 3 years (ages 22-25)
- Current salary: $5M/year
- Peak salary projection: $15M/year (ages 28-32)
- Career length estimate: 10 years peak performance remaining (ages 25-35)
- Current endorsements: $2M/year (Nike, Gatorade, regional sponsors)
- Current net worth: $8M (saved aggressively during rookie years)
- Risk tolerance: Moderate (willing to invest in growth but values some security)

**Client's Goal:**
"I've seen too many athletes go broke after retirement. I want to build generational wealth‚Äî$200M+ net worth by age 50‚Äîso my family is financially secure forever. Help me design a 10-year strategy that achieves this goal."

**Client's Questions for You:**
1. How should I allocate my time, capital, and brand equity across the five revenue streams over the next 10 years?
2. When should I take endorsement deals vs. invest in owned businesses? What's the financial trade-off?
3. Should I invest in women's sports or emerging markets? Which opportunities offer best returns?
4. What assets should I build NOW (during playing career) that will sustain wealth after retirement?

- Reference "Deep Dive: Equity vs. Fees" framework from Module 3

  - Why this fits Jordan's moderate risk tolerance

## Financial Projections Required:

Your memo must include these specific calculations (can be in tables or inline text):

2. **NPV Comparison (Endorsement vs. Owned Business):**

## Element 6: AI Roleplay - Practice Pitch (Optional)

**Purpose:** Students practice presenting their strategy to athlete client before submitting final memo

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **AI Roleplay** element
2. Configure:

**Scenario Title:** "Practice Pitch: Present Your Strategy to Jordan Taylor"

**Objective:**
```
Students will practice presenting their athlete brand strategy verbally to the client (Jordan Taylor) before submitting their written memo. This optional roleplay helps students refine their recommendations by testing clarity, fielding client questions, and ensuring their strategy is defensible.
```

**Scenario Context:**
```
Jordan Taylor (your athlete client) has read your draft strategy memo. They've scheduled a 10-minute meeting to ask clarifying questions before you finalize the memo. You'll present your key recommendations and respond to their concerns.

This is practice‚Äînot graded. Use this to test your strategy's logic before submitting the final written memo.

Conversation length: 4-5 exchanges
```

**AI Role:**
```
You are Jordan Taylor, a 25-year-old elite athlete who hired the student as your brand strategist. You've read their draft strategy memo and have some questions:

- Ask about specific recommendations that seem risky or unclear
- Probe their financial projections ("How did you calculate this IRR?")
- Test whether they've thought through trade-offs ("If I invest $3M in a business, where does that capital come from?")
- Express realistic athlete concerns ("What if my career ends early due to injury?")

Your personality: Thoughtful, business-minded, but not an expert in finance‚Äîask clarifying questions like a smart client would.

After 4-5 exchanges, thank them for clarifying and encourage them to finalize their memo incorporating this discussion.
```

**Student Role:**
```
You are presenting your athlete brand strategy to your client, Jordan Taylor. Start by summarizing your key recommendations, then respond to their questions. This practice helps you refine your final memo.
```

## Element 7: Details - Assessment FAQs

```markdown
Title: Assessment FAQs

[Expand for common questions]

**Q: Can I choose any sport for Jordan Taylor?**
A: Yes. Choose a sport you're familiar with so you can make realistic assumptions about salary progression and brand opportunities.

**Q: Do I need to do external research?**
A: No. Use only Week 4 content (modules, widgets, case study). Everything you need is provided.

**Q: How detailed should financial projections be?**
A: Show your work, but don't over-complicate. Use realistic assumptions (growth rates, discount rates, exit multiples) based on Week 4 frameworks. Tables are helpful but not required.

**Q: Can I use the widget results in my memo?**
A: Yes! Reference specific outputs from Athlete Brand Calculator or Emerging Sports Investment Tool to support your recommendations.

**Q: What if my projections don't reach exactly $200M at age 50?**
A: That's OK. Show a realistic path. If you project $180M, acknowledge the gap and explain what additional strategies could close it.

**Q: Should I cite sources?**
A: Cite the Serena Williams case and Week 4 modules when referencing specific data or frameworks, but formal citations aren't required. Example: "Following Serena Williams' strategy (Week 4 Case), I recommend..."

**Q: Can I get feedback before final submission?**
A: Use the AI Roleplay (Element 6) to practice your pitch and identify weak points. Peer discussion is encouraged (but write your own memo).

**Q: What happens if I go over 1500 words?**
A: Slight variance is OK (up to 1600 words). Significantly exceeding word count suggests lack of editing discipline‚Äîbe concise and strategic.
