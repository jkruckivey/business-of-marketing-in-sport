# From Analysis to Strategy: Your Turn to Build an Athlete Brand (with PAIRR Assessment)

You've mastered the frameworks. You've experimented with simulations. You've analyzed Serena Williams' actual strategy. Now it's time to demonstrate what you've learned by solving a real strategic problem.

**What Makes This Assessment Different:**
This is a **PAIRR assessment** (Peer and AI Review + Reflection), designed to develop your AI literacy alongside strategic thinking. You'll draft a strategy memo, receive feedback from BOTH a peer and ChatGPT, reflect on which feedback is more useful, revise your work, then reflect on your revision choices. This dual-feedback approach mirrors real-world strategic work where you synthesize multiple perspectives.

### The Challenge

An elite 25-year-old athlete has hired you as their brand strategist. They have:
- 10-year peak career ahead (ages 25-35)
- Current salary: $5M/year, growing to $15M/year at peak
- Strong brand appeal but limited business experience
- Goal: Build generational wealth ($200M+ net worth by age 50)

They've seen too many athletes go broke after retirement. They want YOUR strategic plan to avoid that fate.

### Your Task

Write a 1200-1500 word **Strategic Brand Memo** that:
1. Maps their optimal revenue stream allocation across 10 years
2. Recommends owned business vs. endorsement strategy with financial justification
3. Identifies 2-3 specific investment opportunities (women's sports? emerging markets?)
4. Designs post-career transition plan that preserves wealth after retirement

Use Week 4 frameworks, cite Serena Williams case insights, and provide specific financial projections.

**This assessment demonstrates mastery of all 4 Week 4 learning outcomes.**

Let's show what you can do.

# Assessment Prompt: Athlete Brand Strategy Memo

## Scenario

**Client:** Jordan Taylor, 25-year-old elite athlete (you choose sport)

**Current Situation:**
- Professional career: 3 years (ages 22-25)
- Current salary: $5M/year
- Peak salary projection: $15M/year (ages 28-32)
- Career length estimate: 10 years peak performance remaining (ages 25-35)
- Current endorsements: $2M/year (Nike, Gatorade, regional sponsors)
- Current net worth: $8M (saved aggressively during rookie years)
- Risk tolerance: Moderate (willing to invest in growth but values some security)

**Client's Goal:**
"I've seen too many athletes go broke after retirement. I want to build generational wealth‚Äî$200M+ net worth by age 50‚Äîso my family is financially secure forever. Help me design a 10-year strategy that achieves this goal."

**Client's Questions for You:**
1. How should I allocate my time, capital, and brand equity across the five revenue streams over the next 10 years?
2. When should I take endorsement deals vs. invest in owned businesses? What's the financial trade-off?
3. Should I invest in women's sports or emerging markets? Which opportunities offer best returns?
4. What assets should I build NOW (during playing career) that will sustain wealth after retirement?

2. **NPV Comparison (Endorsement vs. Owned Business):**
   - Option A: $10M endorsement over 5 years = $XX NPV
   - Option B: $3M investment in owned business = $XX NPV at exit
   - Conclusion: Option __ creates $XX more wealth

3. **Investment IRR Projections:**
   - Investment 1: [Name] ‚Üí Projected IRR: XX%

# Phase 2A: Peer Feedback Instructions (2 Points Bonus)

After submitting your draft, you'll be assigned a classmate's draft to review. Your task is to provide constructive, specific feedback using the Week 4 rubric.

## How to Provide Effective Peer Feedback:

### Step 1: Read the Draft Carefully (10 minutes)
- Read your classmate's entire memo without making judgments yet
- Note which sections are strong and which need improvement
- Refer to the 100-point rubric (Element 9) to understand grading criteria

### Step 2: Evaluate Using the Rubric (15 minutes)

For each of the 4 MLO sections, assess:

**MLO 4.1: Revenue Stream Allocation (25 points)**
- Are all 5 revenue streams identified with % allocation?
- Is there phase-based strategy (early career vs. peak)?
- Is the allocation justified with strategic reasoning?
- **Feedback to provide:** What's strong? What's missing or unclear?

**MLO 4.2: Owned vs. Endorsed Strategy (25 points)**
- Is there NPV comparison between endorsement and owned business options?
- Are specific owned business opportunities named?
- Are trade-offs (risk, capital, time) addressed?
- **Feedback to provide:** What's strong? What needs more financial rigor?

**MLO 4.3: Investment Opportunities (25 points)**
- Are 2-3 specific investments named (not vague "women's sports")?
- Are IRR projections provided for each?
- Are risk factors and mitigation strategies discussed?
- **Feedback to provide:** What's strong? Which investments need more detail?

**MLO 4.4: Post-Career Transition (20 points)**
- Is there clear plan for ages 35-50?
- Are asset longevity differences explained (what sustains value vs. depreciates)?
- Is age 50 net worth projection provided?
- **Feedback to provide:** What's strong? What's missing from wealth preservation plan?

**Financial Rigor (5 points)**
- Are calculations present and realistic?
- Are assumptions justified?
- **Feedback to provide:** What financial projections are strong? Which need work?

### Step 3: Write Constructive Feedback (10 minutes)

Provide 400-600 word feedback addressing:
1. **What's Working Well:** 2-3 specific strengths (reference section, line, or concept)
2. **What Needs Improvement:** 3-4 specific weaknesses with suggestions
   - Example: "Your MLO 4.3 section mentions 'NWSL investment' but doesn't provide entry valuation, IRR projection, or risk factors. Consider adding: Entry at $40M, projected IRR 18%, risk mitigation through portfolio diversification."
3. **Priority Revision:** If your classmate has limited time, what's the ONE most important revision?

### Step 4: Submit Peer Feedback

Submit your feedback via Element 11 (Peer Feedback Submission Box) by Day 5.

**Grading:** 2 points bonus for completing thorough peer review (not graded on accuracy, graded on effort and specificity).

# Phase 2B: AI Feedback Instructions (1 Point Bonus)

Use ChatGPT (or similar AI tool) to generate feedback on your own draft. This helps you experience AI's feedback style and compare it to human peer feedback.

## How to Generate AI Feedback:

### Step 1: Copy the ChatGPT Prompt Below

```
You are a strategic advisor reviewing an athlete brand strategy memo for an MBA course (Week 4: Athletes, Brands & Emerging Sports). The memo analyzes revenue streams, owned vs. endorsed assets, investment opportunities, and post-career transition for a 25-year-old athlete named Jordan Taylor with a goal of building $200M+ net worth by age 50.

Review the draft below using these criteria:

**MLO 4.1: Revenue Stream Allocation (25 points)**
- Are all 5 streams identified with % allocation and phase-based strategy?
- Is allocation justified strategically?

**MLO 4.2: Owned vs. Endorsed Strategy (25 points)**
- Is there NPV comparison with specific owned business recommendations?
- Are trade-offs addressed?

**MLO 4.3: Investment Opportunities (25 points)**
- Are 2-3 specific investments named with IRR projections and risk assessment?

**MLO 4.4: Post-Career Transition (20 points)**
- Is there clear plan for ages 35-50 with asset longevity analysis and age 50 net worth projection?

**Financial Rigor (5 points)**
- Are calculations realistic and assumptions justified?

Provide feedback on:
1. What's working well (2-3 strengths)
2. What needs improvement (3-4 specific weaknesses with suggestions)
3. Priority revision (if limited time, what's most important to fix?)

Here is the draft memo:

[PASTE YOUR DRAFT HERE]
```

### Step 2: Generate and Save AI Feedback

1. Go to ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com) or similar AI tool
2. Paste the prompt above
3. Paste your draft memo where indicated
4. Copy ChatGPT's response
5. Save the response (you'll submit it and analyze it in Phase 3)

### Step 3: Submit AI Feedback

Submit ChatGPT's full response via Element 12 (AI Feedback Submission Box) by Day 5.

**Grading:** 1 point bonus for generating and submitting AI feedback (not graded on quality, graded on completion).

---

**Why This Matters:**
By getting feedback from both a peer (human) and ChatGPT (AI), you'll develop critical AI literacy skills: understanding where AI excels, where it falls short, and how to synthesize multiple feedback sources‚Äîa crucial skill for modern strategic work.

## Element 7: **NEW** - Phase 3 - Comparative Reflection (was Element 6)

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Text** element
2. Copy markdown below:

```markdown
# Phase 3: Comparative Reflection (1 Point Bonus)

Now that you have feedback from BOTH your peer and ChatGPT, reflect on the differences and similarities. This comparative analysis develops your AI literacy and metacognitive awareness.

## Comparative Reflection Questions:

Write 300-400 words addressing these questions:

### Question 1: Specificity and Actionability

**Which feedback was more specific and actionable‚Äîyour peer's or ChatGPT's? Why?**

- Did your peer identify specific sections/sentences needing work, or give general comments?
- Did ChatGPT provide concrete suggestions, or stay high-level?
- Which feedback would be easier to act on if you only had 30 minutes to revise?

Example response: "My peer's feedback was more actionable because they referenced specific line numbers and provided exact examples (e.g., 'Your MLO 4.3 section line 180 says NWSL investment but needs entry valuation'). ChatGPT was more general, saying 'investment section needs more detail' without specifying which investment or what details."

### Question 2: Agreement and Disagreement

**Where did the two feedback sources agree? Where did they contradict each other?**

- Did both identify the same strengths/weaknesses?
- If they contradicted, which do you trust more‚Äîand why?
- Were there blind spots where neither caught an issue you now see?

Example response: "Both agreed my revenue stream allocation was strong. They contradicted on MLO 4.4: My peer said post-career plan was 'too vague,' while ChatGPT said it was 'adequately detailed.' I trust my peer here because they're grading with the same rubric and standards as the instructor."

### Question 3: Prioritization for Revision

**Which feedback will you prioritize in your revision‚Äîand why?**

- If you can only implement 50% of suggestions, which will you choose?
- Are there suggestions you'll ignore? Why?
- How will you synthesize conflicting feedback?

Example response: "I'll prioritize my peer's suggestion to add specific IRR projections for each investment (MLO 4.3) because that's worth 25 points and currently incomplete. I'll ignore ChatGPT's suggestion to add more background on Jordan Taylor‚Äîthat's not part of the rubric."

### Question 4: AI Literacy Insight

**What did you learn about AI's strengths and limitations for giving strategic feedback?**

- Where does AI excel? (Speed? Breadth? Structure?)
- Where does AI fall short? (Context? Nuance? Judgment?)
- How will you use AI feedback in future work?

Example response: "ChatGPT was fast and gave comprehensive coverage of all 4 MLOs. But it lacked context‚Äîit couldn't tell if my IRR projections were realistic for the industry. My peer caught that my NWSL 50% IRR projection was unrealistic. Future use: I'll use AI for quick structural checks, then seek human feedback for domain-specific judgments."

## Submission:

Submit your 300-400 word comparative reflection via Element 13 (Comparative Reflection Submission Box) by Day 5.

**Grading:** 1 point bonus for completing comparative reflection (graded on depth of analysis and evidence of critical thinking).
```

## Element 8: **NEW** - Phase 5 - Post-Revision Reflection (was Element 7)

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Text** element
2. Copy markdown below:

```markdown
# Phase 5: Post-Revision Reflection (1 Point Bonus)

After revising your memo (Phase 4), reflect on your revision process. This metacognitive reflection solidifies your learning and develops self-awareness about how you incorporate feedback.

## Post-Revision Reflection Questions:

Write 200-300 words addressing these questions:

### Question 1: Feedback Influence on Revisions

**Which feedback (peer or AI) influenced your revisions most? Provide 2-3 specific examples.**

- Did you implement more suggestions from your peer or from ChatGPT?
- Which feedback led to the biggest improvements?
- Were there suggestions you received but didn't implement? Why not?

Example response: "My peer's feedback influenced me most. I implemented all 3 of their specific suggestions: (1) Added IRR projections to MLO 4.3 (NWSL 18%, WNBA 22%, pickleball 35%), (2) Expanded post-career asset longevity analysis in MLO 4.4 by distinguishing endorsements (5-year value) vs. owned businesses (50+ year value), (3) Added NPV comparison table for endorsement vs. owned business. I implemented 2 of ChatGPT's 5 suggestions but ignored the recommendation to add executive summary‚Äînot required by rubric."

### Question 2: Comparative Value

**Was the PAIRR dual-feedback approach more valuable than receiving only one source? Why or why not?**

- Did having both perspectives change your revisions compared to just one?
- Which source would you remove if forced to choose only one‚Äîand why?
- Was the comparative reflection (Phase 3) worthwhile, or felt like busywork?

Example response: "Yes, dual feedback was valuable. ChatGPT caught structural issues (missing sections) that my peer missed, while my peer caught domain-specific errors (unrealistic IRR projections) that ChatGPT missed. If forced to choose one, I'd keep peer feedback‚Äîmore context-aware. But the combination was optimal. Phase 3 comparative reflection felt valuable (not busywork) because it forced me to think critically about AI's role."

### Question 3: Future Application

**How will you use AI feedback tools in your future professional work based on this experience?**

- What role will AI play in your revision process?
- What types of feedback will you still seek from humans?
- How has this assessment changed your view of AI's capabilities/limitations?

Example response: "I'll use AI for fast first-pass structural reviews (Did I address all requirements? Is logic coherent?) before asking human colleagues for deeper feedback. I'll still seek humans for: (1) Domain-specific judgment calls, (2) Strategic prioritization when trade-offs exist, (3) Catching unrealistic assumptions. This assessment showed me AI is a powerful co-pilot but not a replacement for expert human judgment."

## Submission:

Submit your 200-300 word post-revision reflection via Element 15 (Post-Revision Reflection Submission Box) by Day 7 (same deadline as final revised memo).

**Grading:** 1 point bonus for completing post-revision reflection (graded on depth of insight and evidence of metacognitive awareness).

## Element 6: AI Roleplay - Practice Pitch (Optional)
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

**Purpose:** Students practice presenting their strategy to athlete client before submitting final memo

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **AI Roleplay** element
2. Configure:

**Scenario Title:** "Practice Pitch: Present Your Strategy to Jordan Taylor"

**Objective:**
```
Students will practice presenting their athlete brand strategy verbally to the client (Jordan Taylor) before submitting their written memo. This optional roleplay helps students refine their recommendations by testing clarity, fielding client questions, and ensuring their strategy is defensible.
```

**Scenario Context:**
```
Jordan Taylor (your athlete client) has read your draft strategy memo. They've scheduled a 10-minute meeting to ask clarifying questions before you finalize the memo. You'll present your key recommendations and respond to their concerns.

This is practice‚Äînot graded. Use this to test your strategy's logic before submitting the final written memo.

Conversation length: 4-5 exchanges
```

**AI Role:**
```
You are Jordan Taylor, a 25-year-old elite athlete who hired the student as your brand strategist. You've read their draft strategy memo and have some questions:

- Ask about specific recommendations that seem risky or unclear
- Probe their financial projections ("How did you calculate this IRR?")
- Test whether they've thought through trade-offs ("If I invest $3M in a business, where does that capital come from?")
- Express realistic athlete concerns ("What if my career ends early due to injury?")

Your personality: Thoughtful, business-minded, but not an expert in finance‚Äîask clarifying questions like a smart client would.

After 4-5 exchanges, thank them for clarifying and encourage them to finalize their memo incorporating this discussion.
```

**Student Role:**
```
You are presenting your athlete brand strategy to your client, Jordan Taylor. Start by summarizing your key recommendations, then respond to their questions. This practice helps you refine your final memo.
```

```markdown
Title: Assessment FAQs

[Expand for common questions]

**Q: Can I choose any sport for Jordan Taylor?**
A: Yes. Choose a sport you're familiar with so you can make realistic assumptions about salary progression and brand opportunities.

**Q: Do I need to do external research?**
A: No. Use only Week 4 content (modules, widgets, case study). Everything you need is provided.

**Q: How detailed should financial projections be?**
A: Show your work, but don't over-complicate. Use realistic assumptions (growth rates, discount rates, exit multiples) based on Week 4 frameworks. Tables are helpful but not required.

**Q: Can I use the widget results in my memo?**
A: Yes! Reference specific outputs from Athlete Brand Calculator or Emerging Sports Investment Tool to support your recommendations.

**Q: What if my projections don't reach exactly $200M at age 50?**
A: That's OK. Show a realistic path. If you project $180M, acknowledge the gap and explain what additional strategies could close it.

**Q: Should I cite sources?**
A: Cite the Serena Williams case and Week 4 modules when referencing specific data or frameworks, but formal citations aren't required. Example: "Following Serena Williams' strategy (Week 4 Case), I recommend..."

**Q: Can I get feedback before final submission?**
A: Use the AI Roleplay (Element 6) to practice your pitch and identify weak points. Peer discussion is encouraged (but write your own memo).

**Q: What happens if I go over 1500 words?**
A: Slight variance is OK (up to 1600 words). Significantly exceeding word count suggests lack of editing discipline‚Äîbe concise and strategic.

## üéØ FINAL PROJECT CONNECTION

**How Module 6 Supports Your Final Strategic Vision:**

Module 6's strategic memo is practice for designing long-term wealth-building strategies. This capability is central to your Week 5 capstone assessment.

**What You Learned:**
- How to structure 10-year strategic plans with phase-based resource allocation
- How to justify investment decisions using NPV, opportunity cost, and risk-adjusted returns
- How to identify undervalued market opportunities and quantify first-mover advantages
- How to write executive-level strategic recommendations with evidence-based justifications

**How to Apply This to Your Final Project:**

When you write your 5-year strategic vision in Week 5, Module 6's assessment structure becomes your template:

- **Phased Strategy:** Your capstone should break 5 years into phases (Years 1-2: build foundation, Years 3-4: scale, Year 5: optimize). Module 6 taught you this phased thinking with the 10-year athlete strategy.
- **Financial Rigor:** Every major investment in your vision needs NPV analysis or ROI justification. Module 6 required calculating 20-year wealth outcomes‚Äîapply similar rigor to your property's financial projections.
- **Opportunity Identification:** Module 6 required identifying undervalued markets (women's sports, emerging properties). Your Week 5 capstone should identify similar opportunities in your space with data-backed growth theses.
- **Executive Communication:** The memo format you practiced‚Äîstrategic context ‚Üí allocation strategy ‚Üí financial projections ‚Üí risk mitigation‚Äîis exactly what Week 5 requires.

**Real-World Application:** The athlete brand strategy you designed mirrors the strategic plans property executives create for boards. Your Week 5 capstone scales this skill to a comprehensive 5-year vision.
