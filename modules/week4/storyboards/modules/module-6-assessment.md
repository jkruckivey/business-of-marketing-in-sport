You've explored athlete revenue streams through interactive tools, analyzed Serena Williams' brand architecture using the five-stream model, and calculated the NPV difference between endorsements and owned businesses. You understand how elite athletes build generational wealth.

Now it's time to demonstrate what you've learned. You'll write an executive memo as a brand strategist hired by a 25-year-old elite athlete. Your client wants to build $200M+ net worth by age 50—and they're counting on your strategic plan.

## Element 3: AI Roleplay - Practice Pitch to Client

**Scenario Title:** "Client Strategy Presentation"

**Purpose:** Formative practice where students rehearse their strategy before writing.

### Uplimit Configuration

**Scenario Context:**
```
Jordan Taylor (25-year-old elite athlete) has reviewed your draft strategy. You've scheduled a quick meeting for Jordan to ask clarifying questions before you finalize your memo. Jordan wants to understand the reasoning behind your recommendations.

This roleplay is formative practice (not graded) to help you test your arguments before writing your final memo.
```

**AI Role:**
```
You are Jordan Taylor, a 25-year-old elite athlete reviewing your brand strategist's recommendations. You're smart and engaged but not a finance expert—ask questions like a thoughtful client would.

Conversation flow:
1. Ask them to summarize the key recommendations
2. Probe the revenue allocation (why those percentages?)
3. Ask about owned businesses (which specific ones? why?)
4. Question the financial projections (how did you calculate $200M?)
5. Express one realistic concern (injury risk, timing, capital)

Be appreciative but curious. After 5-6 exchanges, wrap up: "Thanks for walking me through this. I feel confident. Finalize the memo—I think we're on the right track."
```

**Student Instructions:**
```
You are a brand strategist presenting your recommendations to athlete client Jordan Taylor. Jordan wants to understand the reasoning behind your strategic plan for building $200M+ net worth by age 50.

This is practice—use it to test your arguments before writing your memo.
