Title: ◉ Week 4 Key Takeaways

You've completed your deep dive into athlete brands and emerging sports! The five critical insights: (1) athletes build wealth through five revenue streams—endorsements, owned businesses, investments, media/content, and licensing—not just prize money, (2) equity compounds while fees don't, making owned assets dramatically more valuable than endorsement deals over time, (3) women's sports and emerging markets offer first-mover opportunities with 300%+ growth rates versus established leagues, (4) post-career planning must happen during playing career when brand value is highest—78% of NFL players go broke because they didn't build equity, and (5) the Serena Williams playbook (30% endorsements / 70% equity) creates generational wealth that endorsement-heavy portfolios cannot match. This foundation prepares you for Week 5's focus on legacy properties, cultural impact, and the future of sports business—plus your final capstone presentation. Well done!

**Up Next:** CFL Expansion Milestone 4, then Week 5 preview.

## CFL Expansion Project: Milestone 4 - Brand Ambassador & Launch Strategy

Your CFL expansion franchise needs more than sponsors—it needs faces. In Milestones 1-3, you analyzed the market, designed media strategy, and built a sponsorship portfolio. Now you'll create a brand ambassador strategy and launch campaign.

**Your Challenge:** Design a brand ambassador and launch strategy for your CFL expansion team that leverages athlete brands to build market presence.

**Why This Matters:** New franchises lack the 50-year history that established teams use to build fan loyalty. Athlete ambassadors can accelerate brand building by lending their personal brands to your new franchise.

**Apply Week 4 Frameworks:**
- Identify potential brand ambassadors (current/former CFL players, local athletes)
- Apply the owned vs. endorsed analysis to your ambassador strategy
- Consider how women's sports athletes might open new fan segments
- Design a launch campaign that builds buzz before the first game
