## Element 1: Infobox Content

Title: ◉ Week 4 Key Takeaways

You've completed your deep dive into athlete brands and emerging sports! The five critical insights: (1) athletes build wealth through five revenue streams—endorsements, owned businesses, investments, media/content, and licensing—not just prize money, (2) equity compounds while fees don't, making owned assets dramatically more valuable than endorsement deals over time, (3) women's sports and emerging markets offer first-mover opportunities with 300%+ growth rates versus established leagues, (4) post-career planning must happen during playing career when brand value is highest—78% of NFL players go broke because they didn't build equity, and (5) the Serena Williams playbook (30% endorsements / 70% equity) creates generational wealth that endorsement-heavy portfolios cannot match. This foundation prepares you for Week 5's focus on legacy properties, cultural impact, and the future of sports business—plus your final capstone presentation. Well done!

**Up Next:** CFL Expansion Milestone 4, then Week 5 preview.

## Element 2: Anchor Project Milestone 4 Introduction

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Text** element
2. Copy markdown below:

```markdown
## CFL Expansion Project: Milestone 4 - Brand Ambassador & Launch Strategy

Your CFL expansion franchise needs more than sponsors—it needs faces. In Milestones 1-3, you analyzed the market, designed media strategy, and built a sponsorship portfolio. Now you'll create a brand ambassador strategy and launch campaign.

**Your Challenge:** Design a brand ambassador and launch strategy for your CFL expansion team that leverages athlete brands to build market presence.

**Why This Matters:** New franchises lack the 50-year history that established teams use to build fan loyalty. Athlete ambassadors can accelerate brand building by lending their personal brands to your new franchise.

**Apply Week 4 Frameworks:**
- Identify potential brand ambassadors (current/former CFL players, local athletes)
- Apply the owned vs. endorsed analysis to your ambassador strategy
- Consider how women's sports athletes might open new fan segments
- Design a launch campaign that builds buzz before the first game

## Element 2A: Brand Package Creator `[v2.1.0]`

**Element Type:** Text + iFrame Widget

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Text** element for the introduction
2. Add **iFrame** element for the widget

### Introduction Text (Copy to Uplimit):

```markdown
## Design Your Team Brand: What Would Attract Your Target Athletes?

You've learned that athletes like Serena Williams carefully protect and grow their personal brands. They don't partner with just anyone—they choose brands that align with their values and amplify their image.

Now flip the perspective: **What kind of team brand would attract the athletes YOU want as ambassadors?**

Before identifying specific ambassadors, define your franchise's visual identity. A strong team brand—compelling name, distinctive colors, memorable mascot—makes it easier to recruit athlete partners who want to be associated with your franchise.

Use this tool to design your team's brand identity. Think about:
- What team name reflects your market's identity? (Halifax Schooners? Quebec Voyageurs?)
- What colors will look great on jerseys AND appeal to sponsors?
- What mascot could become a beloved local icon?

Your brand choices should align with the athlete ambassadors you'll identify in your milestone submission.
