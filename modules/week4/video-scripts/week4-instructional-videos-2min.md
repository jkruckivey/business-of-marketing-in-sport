## Video 1: The Five Revenue Streams of Athlete Wealth (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Introduce athlete revenue diversification before students use the Athlete Brand Calculator
**Placement:** Module 3 (Core Content)

### SCRIPT

**[0:00-0:15] Hook**

**[ON-SCREEN: LeBron James net worth: $1.2B vs. career earnings: $480M]**

**NARRATOR:**
LeBron James earned $480 million playing basketball. But he's worth $1.2 billion. Where did the other $720 million come from?

Athletes today aren't just players—they're brands. Let's explore how.

---

**[0:15-0:45] The Five Revenue Streams**

**[ANIMATION: Five streams appearing with icons]**

**NARRATOR:**
Just like teams have five revenue streams, so do athletes:

**Stream 1: Salary and bonuses.** Your contract with the team. For LeBron, that's $480 million over 21 years.

**Stream 2: Endorsements.** Brands pay for your name and image. LeBron earns $80 million per year from Nike, Pepsi, and AT&T.

**Stream 3: Owned businesses.** Equity, not fees. LeBron's stake in Blaze Pizza sold for over $30 million profit.

**Stream 4: Media and content.** Production companies, podcasts, documentaries. SpringHill Company is valued at $725 million.

**Stream 5: Investments.** Smart capital allocation. LeBron's early investment in Beats by Dre returned $30 million.

---

**[0:45-1:15] Why Diversification Matters**

**[ANIMATION: Two career paths diverging]**

**NARRATOR:**
Here's the critical insight: **Playing careers are short. Brands can last forever.**

The average NFL career is 3.3 years. The average NBA career is 4.5 years. But a well-built brand—Nike's Jordan line, Magic Johnson's business empire—generates wealth for decades.

**[ON-SCREEN: Michael Jordan stats]**

Michael Jordan earned $93 million playing basketball. His Jordan Brand alone generates $5 billion in annual revenue. His net worth? $3.5 billion.

---

**[1:15-1:45] Equity vs. Fees**

**[ANIMATION: Line chart showing linear vs. exponential growth]**

**NARRATOR:**
The biggest lesson: **Equity compounds. Fees don't.**

Taking $1 million to endorse a brand? That's $1 million. Period.

Taking equity in that brand? If it grows 20% annually, that stake is worth $6 million in 10 years. $38 million in 20 years.

Serena Williams, LeBron James, and Michael Jordan all shifted from fees to equity. That's why they're billionaires.

**[1:45-2:00] Transition**

**[ON-SCREEN: Athlete Brand Calculator preview]**

**NARRATOR:**
Next, you'll use the **Athlete Brand Calculator** to build your own portfolio. Allocate $50 million across five streams and see how different strategies create dramatically different 20-year outcomes.

## Video 2: The Emerging Sports Opportunity (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Explain valuation gaps in women's sports and emerging markets before Investment Tool
**Placement:** Module 3 (Core Content)

### SCRIPT

**[0:00-0:15] Hook**

**[ON-SCREEN: NWSL team sale: $53M (2024) vs. MLS team sale: $700M (2024)]**

**NARRATOR:**
An MLS team sells for $700 million. An NWSL team sells for $53 million. Same number of fans, same stadium capacity, same 90-minute games.

That's not a market inefficiency. That's an opportunity.

---

**[0:15-0:45] The Valuation Gap**

**[ANIMATION: Two columns comparing valuations]**

**NARRATOR:**
Emerging sports—women's leagues, pickleball, padel—are massively undervalued compared to established properties.

**[ON-SCREEN: Comparison data appearing]**

- WNBA franchise: **$100-150 million** vs. NBA franchise: **$3-4 billion**
- NWSL team: **$50-100 million** vs. MLS team: **$500-800 million**
- Professional pickleball team: **$5-15 million** vs. MLB team: **$2+ billion**

These valuations reflect *history*, not *potential*. And smart investors see the arbitrage.

---

**[0:45-1:15] Why Now?**

**[ANIMATION: Growth trend lines]**

**NARRATOR:**
Three forces are closing the gap:

**One: Media investment.** The WNBA's new media deal is **$200 million per year**—a 300% increase. NWSL just signed a **$240 million** deal with CBS, ESPN, and Amazon.

**Two: Sponsorship surge.** Brands are racing to associate with women's sports before prices rise. Nike, Google, and Ally Bank are paying premiums for early positioning.

**Three: Attendance records.** WNBA All-Star Game: **3.4 million viewers**—up 305% from 2023. Women's March Madness final: **18.9 million viewers**—more than the men's final.

---

**[1:15-1:45] The Investment Thesis**

**[ANIMATION: Investment returns visualization]**

**NARRATOR:**
Here's the math: If an NWSL team bought today for $75 million reaches 25% of MLS valuations in 10 years, that's a **$100+ million return**.

Same logic applies to pickleball, padel, and international markets.

**[ON-SCREEN: Matt Rubinoff quote]**

Remember Matt Rubinoff from Fairgrounds: *"We're marketing people who happen to love racquet sports."* He built 75,000 members with zero marketing spend because he spotted the wave early.

---

**[1:45-2:00] Transition**

**[ON-SCREEN: Emerging Sports Investment Tool preview]**

**NARRATOR:**
Next, you'll use the **Emerging Sports Investment Tool** to evaluate opportunities across women's sports and emerging markets. Adjust growth rates, risk premiums, and time horizons to find the best risk-adjusted returns.

## Video 3: NIL and the New Athlete Economy (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Explain Name, Image, Likeness rules and impact on athlete marketing
**Placement:** Module 3 (Core Content) or Module 4 (Interactive)

### SCRIPT

**[0:00-0:15] Hook**

**[ON-SCREEN: College athlete signing sponsorship deal + "NIL: $1.17B in 2024"]**

**NARRATOR:**
In 2021, college athletes couldn't legally earn a dollar from their name. In 2024, they earned $1.17 billion through NIL deals.

The athlete economy changed overnight. Here's what you need to know.

---

**[0:15-0:45] What Is NIL?**

**[ANIMATION: NIL acronym expanding]**

**NARRATOR:**
**NIL** stands for **Name, Image, and Likeness**—an athlete's right to profit from their personal brand.

Before July 2021, NCAA rules prohibited college athletes from earning money. A football player with 2 million Instagram followers? Couldn't monetize it. A gymnast who went viral? Couldn't sign a sponsorship.

**[ON-SCREEN: NCAA rule change timeline]**

The NCAA changed its rules under legal pressure. Now college athletes can sign endorsement deals, create content, sell merchandise—anything a professional athlete can do.

---

**[0:45-1:15] The NIL Economy**

**[ANIMATION: Money flowing to different athlete categories]**

**NARRATOR:**
NIL spending has exploded:

**[ON-SCREEN: Key statistics appearing]**

- **$1.17 billion** total NIL deals in 2024
- Top college athletes earn **$1-5 million per year**
- **Football and basketball** represent 70% of deals
- But **women athletes** over-index: women's basketball players earn 2× their male counterparts in NIL per follower

Why? **Social media engagement.** Brands discovered college women athletes have higher engagement rates and more authentic audience connections.

---

**[1:15-1:45] What This Means for Marketing**

**[ANIMATION: Brand strategy implications]**

**NARRATOR:**
For marketers, NIL creates new opportunities—and risks:

**Opportunity:** Access to athletes earlier, at lower costs, with authentic audience connections. A $50,000 NIL deal with a rising star can deliver better ROI than a $5 million deal with an established pro.

**Risk:** NIL deals are unregulated. No standard contracts, no compliance infrastructure, no guaranteed performance. Due diligence matters.

**[ON-SCREEN: Kevin Abrams quote]**

Remember Kevin Abrams: *"Players are coming out of college now where they are brands."* Teams now evaluate incoming players' marketing potential, not just athletic ability.

---

**[1:45-2:00] Transition**

**[ON-SCREEN: Next module preview]**

**NARRATOR:**
NIL is reshaping how athletes build brands from day one. In the next module, you'll apply these concepts to the Serena Williams case study—and see how one athlete built a $300 million brand across all five revenue streams.
