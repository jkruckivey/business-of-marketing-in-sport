**Module:** 0 (Bridge-In)

**Purpose:** Hook students with athlete brand valuation paradox

```
[0:00-0:20] INTRODUCTION & CREDIBILITY
"Hi, I'm [NAME], and I've spent [X] years working in sports marketing and athlete representation. I've negotiated endorsement deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars for athletes across multiple sports.

And I want to start Week 4 with a problem that challenges everything most people think they know about athlete brands."

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "The $500 Million Question"]

[0:20-0:50] THE PARADOX SETUP
"In 2020, Forbes valued Serena Williams' brand at $500 million. That's not her career prize money—just $94 million. It's not her endorsement earnings—about $350 million over her career.

So where does that extra $150-200 million in brand value come from? And more importantly: How do you BUILD a brand worth 5x your on-field earnings?"

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Brand Value ≠ Prize Money + Endorsements"]

[0:50-1:20] REFRAMING THE PROBLEM
"Here's what I've learned: A $500 million brand isn't built on performance alone. Serena is one of the greatest athletes ever—but so are dozens of tennis players who never reached 10% of her brand value.

The difference is strategic brand architecture:
- Which revenue streams to prioritize
- When to invest in post-career assets
- How to build equity in businesses you OWN, not just endorse
- Why women's sports present unique opportunities"

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Performance ≠ Brand Value"]

[1:20-1:50] THIS WEEK'S FOCUS
"This week, you'll learn how elite athletes build $500 million brands. You'll understand the five revenue streams athletes use—and which create long-term wealth versus short-term income. You'll explore why women's sports are the fastest-growing investment opportunity. And you'll analyze Serena Williams' strategic decisions."

[1:50-2:00] CALL TO ACTION
"But first: Can you ALREADY explain where that $500 million value comes from? Take the diagnostic exercise next. Be honest. Reveal your gaps NOW—so we can fill them together."
