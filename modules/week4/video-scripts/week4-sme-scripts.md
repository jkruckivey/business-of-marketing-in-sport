**Visual Style:** SME direct-to-camera with text overlays

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:20]**

**[ON-SCREEN: "The $500 Million Question"]**

**SME:**
Here's a problem that challenges everything most people think they know about athlete brands.

---

**[SECTION: THE PARADOX - 0:20-0:50]**

**[ON-SCREEN: "Brand Value ≠ Prize Money + Endorsements"]**

**SME:**
Serena Williams' career generated nearly $95 million in prize money over 27 years. Her endorsement earnings over her career were substantial. Yet her total brand equity—including her ventures, media presence, and business ownership—represents significantly more value than either of those components alone.

So where does that additional brand value come from? How do you BUILD a brand worth 5x your on-field earnings?

---

**[SECTION: THE INSIGHT - 0:50-1:20]**

**[ON-SCREEN: "Performance ≠ Brand Value"]**

**SME:**
Here's the key insight: Elite brand value isn't built on performance alone. Serena is one of the greatest athletes ever—but so are dozens of tennis players who never reached 10% of her brand equity.

The difference is strategic brand architecture. Which revenue streams to prioritize. When to invest in post-career assets. How to build equity in businesses you OWN, not just endorse.

---

**[SECTION: THIS WEEK - 1:20-1:50]**

**SME:**
This week, you'll learn how elite athletes build substantial personal brands. You'll understand the five revenue streams athletes use—and which create long-term wealth versus short-term income. You'll explore why women's sports are attracting significant investment. And you'll analyze strategic decisions that build generational wealth.

---

**[CLOSING - 1:50-2:00]**

**SME:**
But first: Can you already explain where that brand value comes from? Take the diagnostic exercise next. Reveal your gaps now—so we can fill them together.

**[ON-SCREEN: "Next: Diagnostic Exercise"]**

## VIDEO #13 IO - Cohort - BOSM – W4-M1, V1 (Athlete Revenue Streams)

**Purpose:** Framework for understanding athlete income sources
**Placement:** Module 1 (Welcome)
**Visual Style:** SME with animated graphics

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]**

**[ANIMATION: Five revenue stream icons appearing]**

**SME:**
Every elite athlete has access to five revenue streams. Most athletes optimize for one or two. The highest-net-worth athletes optimize for all five—and know which ones build wealth versus which ones just pay bills.

---

**[SECTION: STREAMS 1-2 - 0:15-0:45]**

**SME:**
Stream one: Prize money and salary. This is what you earn competing. For Serena, nearly $95 million over 27 years—impressive, but it stops when you stop playing.

Stream two: Endorsements. Brands pay you to represent them. This generates ongoing income, but you're renting your image—you don't own anything.

**[ON-SCREEN: "Streams 1-2: Trading Time for Money"]**

---

**[SECTION: STREAMS 3-5 - 0:45-1:15]**

**SME:**
Stream three: Appearances and speaking. Corporate events, keynotes, charity galas. Typically $100K-500K per appearance for elite athletes. High hourly rate, but doesn't scale.

Stream four: Equity deals. Instead of cash, you take ownership stakes. Strategic investments in companies can generate significant returns if those companies succeed.

Stream five: Owned businesses. You build and own the asset. Through Serena Ventures, Williams manages a portfolio of 85+ companies. S by Serena clothing line. These generate value whether she plays tennis or not.

**[ON-SCREEN: "Streams 4-5: Building Assets That Compound"]**

---

**[CLOSING - 1:15-2:00]**

**SME:**
The pattern is clear: Streams one through three trade time for money. Streams four and five build assets that compound. Elite athletes shift from renting their brand to owning their future.

Next, you'll use the Athlete Brand Calculator to model these streams. See how the mix changes an athlete's long-term wealth trajectory.

## VIDEO #14 IO - Cohort - BOSM – W4-M2, V1 (Women's Sports)

**Purpose:** Investment thesis for women's sports
**Placement:** Module 2 (Executive Interviews)
**Visual Style:** SME with data visualizations

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]**

**[ON-SCREEN: "Sponsorship Growth in Women's Sports"]**

**SME:**
Women's sports sponsorship is experiencing rapid growth. The NWSL quadrupled sponsorship revenue over five years to reach approximately $60 million in 2024. The WNBA more than doubled its sponsorship revenue to $55 million in the same period. This isn't charity—it's smart money recognizing an undervalued asset.

---

**[SECTION: THE THESIS - 0:15-0:45]**

**SME:**
Here's the investment thesis. Women's sports audiences are growing rapidly. The 2023 Women's World Cup drew significant global viewership. Women's college basketball viewership has surged.

Yet sponsorship dollars lag far behind—women's sports still represent a small percentage of total sports sponsorship spending. That gap is the opportunity.

**[ON-SCREEN: "Audience Growth | Sponsorship Opportunity = Massive Gap"]**

---

**[SECTION: WHY NOW - 0:45-1:15]**

**SME:**
Why now? Three converging factors. First, media coverage finally caught up—streaming platforms need content, and women's sports deliver engaged audiences.

Second, brands discovered that women's sports fans are more loyal and more likely to purchase from sponsors.

Third, athletes like Serena Williams, Megan Rapinoe, and Caitlin Clark proved individual stars can drive massive engagement.

---

**[SECTION: SMART MONEY - 1:15-1:45]**

**SME:**
The smart money is moving fast. Major media companies are securing women's sports rights. Financial services brands are becoming jersey sponsors and official partners. Investment rounds are filling up quickly.

These aren't feel-good investments—they're bets on a market that's been underpriced for decades.

---

**[CLOSING - 1:45-2:00]**

**SME:**
The question for brands: Do you sponsor women's sports now while valuations are relatively low, or wait until prices catch up? Your analysis should factor in this growth trajectory.

**[ON-SCREEN: "Next: Executive Interviews"]**

## VIDEO #15 IO - Cohort - BOSM – W4-M3, V1 (Emerging Sports)

**Purpose:** Framework for emerging sports investment decisions
**Placement:** Module 3 (Interactive)
**Visual Style:** SME with comparison graphics

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]**

**[ON-SCREEN: "Emerging Sports Growth"]**

**SME:**
Pickleball has grown dramatically in recent years. Padel is the fastest-growing racket sport in Europe. Esports viewership rivals traditional sports. How do you evaluate whether to invest in an emerging sport?

---

**[SECTION: FOUR FACTORS - 0:15-0:45]**

**[ANIMATION: Four-factor framework appearing]**

**SME:**
Use the four-factor framework. Factor one: Demographic breadth. Does it appeal to multiple age groups? Broader appeal means staying power. Narrow demographics create growth risk if the audience doesn't expand.

Factor two: Accessibility. Can anyone play? Low barriers to entry mean faster adoption.

---

**[SECTION: FACTORS 3-4 - 0:45-1:15]**

**SME:**
Factor three: Media viability. Can it be broadcast or streamed? Some sports work on traditional media, others thrive on digital platforms. Understand the broadcast economics before investing.

Factor four: Monetization infrastructure. Are there leagues, tours, venues? You need commercial structure to create sponsorship opportunities. Without structure, there's no revenue model.

**[ON-SCREEN: "Demographics | Accessibility | Media | Infrastructure"]**

---

**[SECTION: APPLICATION - 1:15-1:45]**

**SME:**
Apply this to emerging sports opportunities. Each property has different strengths and weaknesses. Some have demographic breadth but limited infrastructure. Others have strong media properties but narrow audiences.

The right answer depends on your timeline and risk tolerance.

---

**[CLOSING - 1:45-2:00]**

**SME:**
Your analyst's interview shows how to validate emerging sports opportunities before scaling. Watch for the proof-of-concept methodology—that's how professional investors evaluate new markets.

## VIDEO #16 IO - Cohort - BOSM – W4-M4, V1 (Serena Case)

**Purpose:** Frame the case study analysis
**Placement:** Module 4 (Case Study)
**Visual Style:** SME direct-to-camera

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]**

**SME:**
Serena Williams is not just an exceptional tennis player. She's a case study in how athletes transform athletic excellence into business empires. Your analysis should focus on the strategic decisions, not just the achievements.

---

**[SECTION: THREE PIVOTS - 0:15-0:45]**

**[ON-SCREEN: "Three Strategic Pivots"]**

**SME:**
The case presents three strategic pivots. First, from endorser to investor. Serena shifted from taking endorsement cash to taking equity stakes in companies. Strategic investments in emerging companies created opportunities for significant returns.

Second, from athlete to founder. Serena Ventures now manages a portfolio of 85+ companies. She's not just investing—she's building a venture firm.

---

**[SECTION: PIVOT THREE - 0:45-1:15]**

**SME:**
Third, from individual to platform. S by Serena isn't just a clothing line—it's a platform for other women entrepreneurs. She's leveraging her brand to amplify others, which increases her influence and deal flow.

The question isn't whether Serena is successful—it's whether her playbook is replicable. Can other athletes follow this path? What did she have that others don't? What did she do that others could copy?

---

**[SECTION: TIMING - 1:15-1:45]**

**SME:**
As you analyze the case, focus on timing. When did she start investing? When did she launch Serena Ventures? How did she balance business building with competing?

The sequencing matters—she built business infrastructure while still playing, so she had momentum when she transitioned away from competitive tennis.

---

**[CLOSING - 1:45-2:00]**

**SME:**
The AI Case Coach will help you map Serena's decisions to the five revenue streams framework. Look for the inflection points where she shifted from trading time for money to building compounding assets.
