# Phase 2A: Peer Feedback Instructions (2 Points Bonus)

After completing your draft strategic vision memo, you'll review a classmate's draft.

## How to Provide Effective Peer Feedback:

### Step 1: Read the Draft (20 minutes)
- Read your classmate's complete draft strategic vision memo
- Note strengths and areas for improvement
- Refer to the 100-point rubric (Element 7) for grading criteria

### Step 2: Evaluate Using Rubric (25 minutes)

**Integration of Course Frameworks (30 points)**
- Does the memo integrate frameworks from all 5 weeks?
- Are frameworks applied (not just mentioned)?
- Does the memo show how strategies reinforce each other?
- **Feedback:** What's strong? Which weeks need better integration?

**Strategic Narrative & Analysis (25 points)**
- Is there a clear, compelling strategic vision?
- Are decisions supported by data and projections?
- Are trade-offs and risks addressed?
- **Feedback:** What's strong? Where does analysis need more depth?

**5-Year Roadmap & Implementation (20 points)**
- Are Year 1-5 priorities clear and specific?
- Are milestones measurable?
- Are investment requirements and funding sources identified?
- **Feedback:** What's strong? What's missing from the roadmap?

**Financial Viability (15 points)**
- Are financial projections realistic and detailed?
- Are revenue growth assumptions justified?
- Is ROI analysis provided?
- **Feedback:** What's strong? Which projections need more justification?

**Executive Communication (10 points)**
- Professional memo format? Clear writing? Within word limit?
- **Feedback:** What's strong? Any clarity issues?

### Step 3: Write Constructive Feedback (15 minutes)

Provide 500-700 word feedback addressing:
1. **What's Working Well:** 3-4 specific strengths
2. **What Needs Improvement:** 4-5 specific weaknesses with suggestions
3. **Priority Revision:** If limited time, what are the TWO most important fixes?

**Example Feedback:**
"Your Week 2 media strategy is excellent—you clearly explained the shift from linear to streaming with specific subscriber projections and revenue impact ($45M → $62M by Year 3). However, Week 3 sponsorship strategy feels disconnected. How does your streaming platform create new sponsorship inventory? Consider adding: 'Digital streaming allows dynamic ad insertion worth $8M annually, 40% premium over linear rates.' Also, your risk analysis mentions 'cord-cutting' but doesn't explain mitigation—what's your Plan B if streaming growth is slower than projected?"

### Step 4: Submit Peer Feedback

Submit via peer feedback submission box (Element 10) by Day 7.

**Grading:** 2 points bonus for completing thorough peer review.

# Phase 2B: AI Feedback Instructions (1 Point Bonus)

After completing your draft, generate AI feedback using ChatGPT.

## How to Generate AI Feedback:

### Step 1: Copy the Prompt Template (2 minutes)

Copy this entire prompt into ChatGPT:

```
You are a strategic advisor reviewing a 5-year strategic vision memo for an MBA capstone project focused on the Business of Marketing in Sport.

Review the draft below using these criteria (100 points total):

**Integration of Course Frameworks (30 points):**
Does the memo integrate frameworks from all 5 weeks? Week 1: Revenue ecosystem analysis with specific percentages. Week 2: Media rights and fan engagement strategy. Week 3: Sponsorship and/or betting strategy. Week 4: Athlete branding or emerging sports. Week 5: Legacy/innovation trade-offs OR future trends. Are frameworks applied (not just mentioned)? Does the memo show how strategies reinforce each other?

**Strategic Narrative & Analysis (25 points):**
Is there a clear, compelling strategic vision connecting all elements? Are decisions supported by specific data and financial projections? Are trade-offs and risks addressed explicitly?

**5-Year Roadmap & Implementation (20 points):**
Are Year 1-5 priorities clear and specific with measurable milestones? Are investment requirements and funding sources identified?

**Financial Viability (15 points):**
Are financial projections realistic and detailed? Are revenue growth assumptions justified with course frameworks? Is ROI analysis provided?

**Executive Communication (10 points):**
Professional memo format? Clear, concise writing appropriate for board presentation? Within 1,500-2,000 word limit?

Provide feedback in this format:
1. **What's Working Well:** 3-4 specific strengths with examples
2. **What Needs Improvement:** 4-5 specific weaknesses with actionable suggestions
3. **Priority Revisions:** If limited time, what are the TWO most important fixes?

Pay special attention to:
- Cross-week integration (not siloed strategies)
- Specificity of financial projections (not vague)
- Trade-off analysis (acknowledging constraints and risks)
- Measurable milestones (not generic goals)

Here is the draft strategic vision memo:

```markdown
# Phase 3: Comparative Reflection (1 Point Bonus)

Now that you've received both peer feedback and AI feedback, compare them.

## Reflection Prompt:

Write 300-400 words comparing the peer feedback you received vs. the AI feedback you generated. Address:

### 1. Quality Comparison (150-200 words)
- Which feedback was more specific? More actionable?
- Did peer feedback catch anything AI missed (or vice versa)?
- Which feedback better understood your strategic context?
- Were there contradictions between peer and AI feedback? If so, which did you trust more and why?

### 2. Usefulness for Revision (100-150 words)
- Which feedback will most influence your revision? Why?
- Did one source identify a "priority fix" you hadn't considered?
- Were there suggestions you plan to ignore? Why?

### 3. AI Literacy Insight (50 words)
- What did this exercise teach you about AI's strengths and limitations for strategic analysis?

**Example Excerpt:**
"My peer reviewer provided more industry-specific feedback, noting that my Week 3 sponsorship strategy didn't leverage betting engagement multipliers—something only someone who completed the FanDuel case would catch. However, the AI feedback was more systematic in checking integration across all 5 weeks. It caught that I mentioned Week 4 athlete branding but never actually integrated it into my sponsorship or media strategies. The contradiction was interesting: my peer said my financial projections were 'detailed,' while AI said they 'lacked justification for growth assumptions.' Reviewing my draft again, AI was right—I projected 35% media revenue growth but didn't explain why (cord-cutting + streaming + engagement data). For revision, I'll prioritize AI's integration check (add explicit Week 4 connection) and peer's industry insight (add betting multiplier calculation)..."

# Phase 5: Post-Revision Reflection (1 Point Bonus)

After submitting your final revised strategic vision memo, reflect on your revision process.

## Reflection Prompt:

Write 200-300 words reflecting on which feedback most influenced your final revision. Address:

### 1. Revision Choices (150-200 words)
- Which specific feedback did you incorporate? (Reference peer or AI by type)
- What changes did you make to your memo based on feedback?
- Was there feedback you chose NOT to incorporate? Why?
- Did you make any revisions that weren't suggested by either peer or AI?

### 2. Learning About Feedback (50-100 words)
- What did this process teach you about using feedback effectively?
- Will you approach peer review or AI tools differently in future strategic planning work?

**Example Excerpt:**
"I incorporated 6 major revisions: (1) Added explicit Week 4 athlete branding connection to sponsorship strategy [AI feedback], (2) Integrated betting engagement multipliers into sponsorship revenue projections [peer feedback], (3) Added specific funding sources for Year 1-2 investments (debt vs. equity split) [AI feedback], (4) Expanded risk mitigation for streaming growth assumption [peer feedback], (5) Cut 300 words of background to stay under word limit [AI feedback], (6) Strengthened executive summary to be readable in 60 seconds [peer feedback]. I chose NOT to incorporate peer's suggestion to 'focus only on 3 weeks instead of all 5'—while I appreciated the simplicity argument, the assignment explicitly requires 5-week integration. I also made one revision neither source suggested: I added a competitor analysis table showing how my property compares to 3 rivals across revenue streams, inspired by the Rogers vs. TSN case from Week 2. This process taught me that AI is better at structural/completeness checks while peers catch strategic nuances and industry context. Going forward, I'll use AI first for rubric alignment, then peer review for strategic soundness..."
