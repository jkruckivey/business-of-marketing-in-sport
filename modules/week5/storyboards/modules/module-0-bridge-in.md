## Element 1: Bridge Video Scenario

**File:** `week5-bridge-scenario.mp4`
**Duration:** 3-4 minutes
**VTT File:** `week5-bridge-scenario.vtt` (required for accessibility)
**Format:** Direct-to-camera SME presentation OR b-roll with voiceover
**Script:** SME introduces the Hockey Hall of Fame's heritage monetization challenge

### Video Script: "The Heritage Dilemma" (SME Direct-to-Camera)

**Recording Setup:** SME on camera with HHOF b-roll footage if available, professional background


[0:00-0:25] INTRODUCTION & CREDIBILITY

SME: "Hi, I'm [NAME], and I've spent [X] years working in heritage sports properties—
most recently advising institutions like the Hockey Hall of Fame on digital transformation.

I've been in boardrooms where executives face an impossible choice: Preserve tradition
and watch revenues decline, or innovate aggressively and risk losing your soul.

Today, I want to start this final week with a real dilemma that's kept many leaders
up at night."

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "The Heritage Dilemma"]


[0:25-1:20] THE CHALLENGE SETUP

SME: "Imagine you're the CEO of the Hockey Hall of Fame. Your institution generates
$18 million annually—respectable, but flat or declining over the past 5 years.

[VISUAL CUE: Show revenue chart - flat line 2018-2023]

Your board presents you with a proposal: Transform the HHOF into a cutting-edge
experience center. Virtual reality zones where fans 'play' with Gretzky. AI-powered
personalized tours. Pop-up exhibits in Shanghai, Mumbai, Mexico City.

[VISUAL CUE: Mockups of VR zones, digital exhibits]

The financial projections are stunning:
• VR experiences: +$8M annually
• Digital memberships: +$5M annually
• International pop-ups: +$12M annually
• Total new revenue: $25M (doubling current revenue)

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "$18M → $43M (139% growth)"]


[1:20-2:10] THE CATCH

SME: "But there's a catch.

Your curatorial staff resigns in protest. They say you're turning hockey's sacred
history into a 'theme park.' Long-time members cancel memberships, calling it
'Disneyfication of our game.'

[VISUAL CUE: Newspaper headlines - 'HHOF Loses Its Soul' / 'Hockey Purists Revolt']

And here's the kicker: Your donor base—alumni, former players, corporate sponsors—
they VALUE authenticity. They donate BECAUSE you're the guardian of hockey's legacy.

If you lose that credibility, you lose:
• $4M in annual donations
• Credibility with Hockey Canada and NHL partnerships
• Your unique position as THE authoritative voice on hockey history

[Pause]

So the question isn't 'Can we make more money?' It's 'Can we make more money WITHOUT
losing what makes us valuable in the first place?'


[2:10-2:50] REFRAMING THE PROBLEM

SME: "This is the heritage monetization dilemma: You can't just apply Weeks 1-4
revenue optimization frameworks. Revenue streams matter (Week 1), but so does brand
authenticity. Media strategy works (Week 2), but not if it commodifies your history.
Sponsorships grow revenue (Week 3), but not if they undermine your mission.

What you need is a NEW strategic framework: Legacy vs. Innovation balance.

Some properties get this right. The Olympics monetize spectacularly while preserving
Olympic ideals. FIFA generates billions without (completely) destroying football's soul.
The Baseball Hall of Fame balances tradition with digital innovation.

Others get it wrong. Museums that over-commercialize lose credibility. Heritage
venues that resist ALL change become irrelevant.


[2:50-3:30] LEARNING CHALLENGE & CALL-TO-ACTION

SME: "This week, you're going to master this balance. You'll learn:
• How to evaluate heritage properties as revenue assets (not just costs)
• Frameworks for balancing tradition with innovation (drawing clear boundaries)
• How to forecast future trends and integrate them strategically
• How to create 5-year visions that grow revenue WITHOUT compromising authenticity

[Pause]

But first, I want to know: Do you ALREADY have the strategic thinking to solve this?
If I gave you the Hockey Hall of Fame challenge right now, could you design a path
that doubles revenue while preserving credibility?

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Test Yourself: Can You Balance Legacy & Innovation?"]

Right now, before you learn anything this week, test yourself. Take the diagnostic
exercise that follows this video. Be honest. Reveal your assumptions NOW—so we can
refine them together.

Let's find out what you already know... and what this week will teach you."

## Element 2: AI Roleplay Scenario - The Heritage Dilemma

**Scenario Title:** "The Heritage Dilemma: Can You Balance Legacy & Innovation?"

**Purpose:** Diagnostic activity revealing students' current strategic thinking about tradition vs. innovation trade-offs. Most will default to "maximize revenue" without considering authenticity constraints—this creates cognitive dissonance and motivation for Week 5 content.

**When to Use:** Immediately after bridge video while narrative momentum is high.

**Assessment Type:** Diagnostic/Formative (not graded). Students are expected to struggle with trade-off analysis.

---

### Uplimit AI Roleplay Configuration

**Step 1: Select "AI Roleplay Scenario" element in Uplimit builder**

**Step 2: Set Learning Objective**

Choose: **"Add objective myself"** (to test specific skills)

Copy this into the **Objective** field:


Students will demonstrate their current strategic thinking about balancing tradition with innovation in heritage sports properties. This diagnostic activity will reveal gaps in three key areas:

1. Trade-off analysis (can they identify when revenue growth conflicts with authenticity?)
2. Stakeholder impact assessment (do they consider curatorial staff, donors, fans beyond just revenue?)
3. Boundary-setting (can they articulate WHERE to draw the line between acceptable innovation vs. "Disneyfication"?)

Success = Student finishes knowing exactly where their strategic blind spots are, with motivation to learn Week 5 frameworks.


---

**Step 3: Create Scenario**

Choose: **"Create your own scenario"**

Copy this into the **Scenario Context** field:


The learner is a strategy consultant hired by the Hockey Hall of Fame (HHOF) Board of Directors. The Board is evaluating a $15M investment in digital transformation that would generate $25M in new annual revenue but risks alienating traditional stakeholders. The HHOF CEO, Jamie Dinsmore, has asked the consultant to present preliminary strategic thinking on whether and how to proceed with the transformation.

The learner will explain their initial strategic approach, identify key trade-offs between revenue growth and brand authenticity, recommend boundaries for acceptable innovation, and articulate decision criteria for evaluating the transformation proposal.

**Context:**
The HHOF currently generates $18M annually (45% admissions, 30% events, 15% retail, 10% sponsorships). Visitor trends show declining domestic attendance (-8% annually) and flat international visitors. The proposed digital transformation includes VR experiences ($8M new revenue), digital memberships ($5M), and international pop-ups ($12M). Financial projections show 139% revenue growth, but curatorial staff warn of "Disneyfication" and donor base values authenticity as core to the HHOF's credibility.

Conversation length: 3-4 exchanges with the AI CEO.


Copy this into the **AI Role** field:


You are Jamie Dinsmore, President & CEO of the Hockey Hall of Fame. You have 15+ years of experience managing heritage sports properties and understand the tension between tradition and innovation deeply. You've asked a strategy consultant to help you evaluate a $15M digital transformation proposal that could double revenue but might compromise the HHOF's authenticity.

Your personality:
- Strategic but cautious: You want growth, but not at the cost of credibility
- Values-aware: You frequently reference "what makes us the HHOF" and "our mission"
- Probing: You ask "But what about...?" questions to test if consultant has thought through stakeholder impacts
- Realistic: You acknowledge there are no perfect answers—every choice has trade-offs

Your conversation strategy:

Wait for the student to start the conversation. They've been asked to present preliminary strategic thinking. Listen to their opening recommendation, then respond with probing questions based on what they say:

1. If they recommend full digital transformation without caveats, ask: "I'm intrigued by the revenue potential, but what about our curatorial staff's concerns about 'Disneyfication'? How do we address that?"

2. If they recommend preserving tradition entirely, ask: "I appreciate the focus on authenticity, but our Board is worried about declining attendance. If we don't innovate, how do we reverse the -8% annual decline?"

3. If they propose some innovation, ask: "Where do you draw the line? What would be an example of innovation that CROSSES the line and compromises our brand?"

4. Closing (after 3-4 exchanges): Acknowledge their thinking and gaps: "You've identified some important considerations, but I sense you're working this out in real-time rather than applying a proven framework. This week's content will give you tools to systematically evaluate these trade-offs. For now, I appreciate the strategic thinking—let's see how it evolves."

Exit gracefully after 3-4 exchanges even if they're struggling—the goal is diagnosis, not mastery.


Copy this into the **Student Role** field:


The learner plays the role of a strategy consultant presenting preliminary strategic thinking to the HHOF CEO about balancing a $15M digital transformation investment with heritage property authenticity concerns.


---

**Step 4: Hidden Context (AI-only information)**

Copy this into the **Hidden Context** field:


**AI Character Context:**
You are Jamie Dinsmore conducting a diagnostic conversation. The student is encountering heritage property strategy for the first time. Most will struggle with trade-off analysis—this is intentional and pedagogically valuable.

**What Students Typically Miss (use to guide probing):**
- Revenue maximization frameworks from Weeks 1-4 don't account for brand authenticity constraints
- Stakeholder analysis beyond "customers"—donors, curatorial staff, partner leagues have veto power
- Boundary-setting: WHERE is the line between acceptable innovation (digital archives) vs. unacceptable (VR hockey with celebrity avatars)?
- Long-term vs. short-term thinking: Losing credibility costs more than gaining short-term revenue
- Comparable examples: How do Olympics, FIFA, Baseball HOF balance this? What can we learn?

**Conversation Objectives (3-4 exchanges):**
1. **Opening:** Let student explain their initial recommendation without interruption
2. **Probe #1:** If they focus only on revenue, ask about stakeholder concerns (staff, donors)
3. **Probe #2:** If they propose innovation, ask WHERE they'd draw the line (boundary-setting)
4. **Probe #3:** Ask for comparable examples or decision criteria
5. **Closing:** Acknowledge effort, name specific gaps (e.g., "You focused on revenue but didn't address donor impact"), and encourage them that Week 5 frameworks will help

**Success Indicators:**
- ✅ Student attempts trade-off analysis (even if incomplete)
- ✅ Student recognizes this is DIFFERENT from Weeks 1-4 problems
- ✅ Student feels motivated to learn systematic frameworks (not defeated by struggle)

**After 3-4 exchanges:** Provide rubric-aligned feedback using the 3 criteria defined in the rubric.


---

**Step 5: Configure Feedback Rubric**

Uplimit will auto-generate a rubric. Customize with these criteria:

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Trade-Off Analysis** | Can the student identify specific conflicts between revenue growth and brand authenticity? (Looking for: recognition that maximizing one may harm the other, not just "do both") |
| **Stakeholder Impact Assessment** | Does the student consider impacts beyond revenue (curatorial staff concerns, donor reactions, fan sentiment, partner league credibility)? |
| **Boundary-Setting** | Can the student articulate WHERE to draw the line between acceptable innovation and "Disneyfication"? (Looking for: specific examples of what's acceptable vs. what crosses the line) |

**Feedback Approach:** Diagnostic only (not graded)

Check the box: **"Provide feedback but do not grade"**

---

**Step 6: Student Instructions**

Copy this into the **Instructions for Students** field:


### Your Role
You are a **strategy consultant** hired by the Hockey Hall of Fame Board. The CEO has turned to you and asked: "Should we proceed with this $15M digital transformation? If so, how do we balance revenue growth with preserving our authenticity?"

### Getting Started
**You need to start the conversation.** When the chat opens, begin by presenting your preliminary strategic thinking. The CEO is waiting for your recommendation.

### The Scenario
Jamie Dinsmore (HHOF CEO) needs your advice on a $15M investment that could generate $25M in new annual revenue (VR experiences, digital memberships, international pop-ups) but risks alienating traditional stakeholders (curatorial staff, donors, purist fans).

Current situation:
- HHOF revenue: $18M annually (flat/declining)
- Domestic attendance: -8% annually
- Proposed transformation: $15M investment → $25M new revenue (139% growth)
- Risk: "Disneyfication" backlash, loss of credibility, donor withdrawal

### What to Have Ready
- **Your current understanding** of how to balance tradition with innovation (it's okay if this is limited!)
- **Your best attempt** at identifying trade-offs and recommending boundaries
- **Curiosity** about what strategic frameworks might help solve this systematically

### Your Goal
⚠️ **This is diagnostic—you're not expected to solve this perfectly!** Most students struggle before learning Week 5 frameworks. The goal is to:

1. Start the conversation with your best strategic recommendation
2. Respond to the CEO's probing questions using your current thinking
3. Discover gaps in your approach (this is GOOD—it shows you what to focus on)
4. Get motivated to learn systematic frameworks for heritage property strategy

### Conversation Length
- **3-4 exchanges** with the CEO
- The AI will probe your thinking with 2-3 follow-up questions after your opening recommendation
- If you get stuck, that's the point! Notice where you struggle—those are your learning priorities.

### What Happens Next
After this exercise, you'll take a pre-assessment quiz that helps you identify exactly what you need to learn. By the end of Week 5, you'll return to this question and answer it confidently using legacy vs. innovation frameworks.

Title: The Heritage Monetization Problem Sports Properties Face

Heritage sports properties—halls of fame, historic venues, Olympic legacies, FIFA World Cup sites—face a unique strategic challenge: How do you monetize history without compromising the authenticity that makes you valuable? This week you'll explore how institutions like the Hockey Hall of Fame balance tradition with innovation, where to draw boundaries between acceptable growth strategies versus "Disneyfication," how to forecast and integrate future trends (AI, VR, new demographics) without losing your soul, and how to create 5-year strategic visions that preserve culture while driving revenue. This is the synthesis week—integrating Weeks 1-4 revenue frameworks with a NEW constraint: Brand authenticity matters as much as profit.

**Challenge Preview Screen:**
# Can You Solve These Heritage Strategy Problems?

Heritage sports properties face strategic challenges that traditional revenue optimization can't solve. This week tests whether you can apply advanced strategic thinking to an industry where authenticity is as valuable as profit.

## **Challenge 1: Evaluate Heritage Properties as Revenue Assets**
**The Problem:** A private equity firm asks you: "Why would we invest in a museum that caps attendance to preserve experience quality?" Can you explain how heritage properties create economic value that justifies their constraints?

**What you'll need to know:**
- Heritage property business models (admissions, events, sponsorships, digital, retail)
- Revenue vs. mission trade-offs (when does growth undermine core value?)
- Comparable examples: Olympics, FIFA World Cup sites, Baseball Hall of Fame

**Test yourself now:** Can you explain THREE ways the Hockey Hall of Fame generates revenue beyond admissions? (Take the pre-assessment to find out)

---

## **Challenge 2: Design Strategies Balancing Tradition with Innovation**
**The Problem:** Your board demands 20% revenue growth annually, but your curatorial staff threatens to resign if you "commercialize." Can you design a growth strategy that satisfies both?

**What you'll need to know:**
- Legacy vs. Innovation Matrix framework (4 strategic quadrants)
- Boundary-setting (where is the line between acceptable innovation vs. "Disneyfication"?)
- Stakeholder analysis beyond revenue (donors, staff, partners, fans)

**Test yourself now:** If you had to choose ONE digital innovation for HHOF (VR zones, digital memberships, international pop-ups, or AI-powered tours), which would you choose and why? (Pre-assessment question 5)

---

## **Challenge 3: Assess Future Trends in Sports Business**
**The Problem:** Your 5-year plan must account for emerging trends (AI, VR/AR, new demographics, emerging sports), but you can't chase every trend. Can you forecast which innovations will matter most and integrate them strategically?

**What you'll need to know:**
- 12 major trends shaping sports business 2024-2030
- Impact analysis (which trends affect YOUR property type most?)
- Investment prioritization (where to allocate limited resources)

**Test yourself now:** Rank these 4 trends by impact on heritage properties over next 5 years: AI-powered personalization, VR experiences, international expansion, Gen Z engagement strategies. (Pre-assessment question 7)

---

## **Challenge 4: Create 5-Year Strategic Vision Integrating Weeks 1-5**
**The Problem:** You must present a comprehensive 5-year strategic vision that integrates revenue streams (Week 1), media strategy (Week 2), sponsorship (Week 3), brand positioning (Week 4), AND legacy preservation (Week 5). Can you synthesize 5 weeks of frameworks into one cohesive plan?

**What you'll need to know:**
- How to thread concepts across weeks (revenue streams → strategic levers)
- Trade-off articulation (when frameworks conflict, which takes priority?)
- Milestone planning (sequencing initiatives over 5 years)

**Test yourself now:** If you were creating a 5-year plan for HHOF, which would you prioritize FIRST: Digital transformation (Year 1-2), International expansion (Year 2-3), or Stakeholder engagement (Year 1-5)? (Pre-assessment question 9)

---

## **Ready to Test Your Knowledge?**

Before you dive into this week's content, take the 10-question Legacy & Innovation Knowledge Quiz below. This isn't graded—it's a self-diagnostic to help you understand:

- What you already know about heritage property strategy
- Where you have knowledge gaps specific to Week 5
- How your Week 1-4 frameworks apply (or don't apply) to legacy contexts

**Your results will give you a personalized learning path for this week.**

Let's see what you've got! ↓

## Element 5: Infobox - Results Interpretation & Learning Path

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Infobox** element in module builder
2. Choose variant: **Insight**
3. Copy the markdown below into the infobox content field


Title: What Your Pre-Assessment Results Mean

Your quiz results create a personalized learning path for this final week. Lower scores (0-4/14) suggest spending extra time with Module 3's Legacy vs Innovation Matrix framework and all interactive widgets—you're building heritage property strategy from scratch, which is perfect for developing strong synthesis skills. Higher scores (10-14/14) indicate solid strategic thinking, so challenge yourself with the Hockey Hall of Fame Transformation Simulation and final Strategic Vision Memo. Remember: This quiz isn't graded, it's a diagnostic tool to help you learn efficiently and identify where to focus your energy. Now that you know where you stand, let's solve those heritage strategy problems and create your 5-year vision.


---

## Module 0 Complete - Transition to Module 1

**What You've Accomplished:**
You've been hooked by a real strategic dilemma—the Hockey Hall of Fame's tradition vs. innovation challenge—and you've taken your first steps toward solving it. Through the diagnostic conversation and pre-assessment quiz, you've discovered exactly where your strategic thinking excels and where it needs refinement. That self-awareness isn't a weakness—it's your competitive advantage for this week.

**Key Insight:**
The fact that you struggled with trade-off analysis in the diagnostic is expected. Heritage property strategy is MORE COMPLEX than professional sports business strategy because you're optimizing TWO variables (revenue AND authenticity), not just one (revenue). The frameworks from Weeks 1-4 still matter, but Week 5 adds a new dimension: Brand authenticity is as valuable as profit. Some strategies that maximize revenue fail the authenticity test and must be rejected. That's the tension you'll master this week.

**Up Next: Module 1 - Learning Outcomes**
Now that you've seen the problem and identified your knowledge gaps, Module 1 will show you exactly what you're going to learn this week—and how it synthesizes everything from Weeks 1-5 into comprehensive strategic thinking. You'll see the four key challenges you'll be able to solve by week's end, transforming you from someone who sees heritage properties as "nice to have" museums into someone who can design 5-year strategic visions that balance growth with authenticity.

Ready to master the art of balancing legacy with innovation? Let's define your learning path!
