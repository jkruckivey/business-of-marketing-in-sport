### 💼 Project Preview: Week 5 = Your Final Strategic Vision

This is it. Week 5 is where you synthesize everything you've learned into your **capstone deliverable**: a 5-year Strategic Vision Memo for a sports property of your choice.

You've built the foundations: revenue ecosystem analysis (Week 1), media rights expertise (Week 2), sponsorship and betting strategies (Week 3), and athlete/emerging sports insights (Week 4). Now you'll integrate these frameworks to answer the ultimate question: *"Where should this property be in five years, and how will it get there?"*

Your Strategic Vision Memo isn't an academic exercise—it's the kind of document real sports executives present to boards, investors, and ownership groups.

### Element 1: Infobox Content

Title: ◉ Week 5 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
• WLO 5.1: Evaluate how heritage assets and brand history create sustainable competitive advantage
• WLO 5.2: Evaluate the tension between tradition and innovation in sports organizational strategy
• WLO 5.3: Assess emerging trends (women's sports growth, technology integration, sustainability) and their business impact
• WLO 5.4: Develop a 5-year strategic vision that balances heritage preservation with market evolution

This week focuses on CLO 5: Integrating Legacy and Future Growth


### Element 2: Text Content

The Final Frontier: Where Legacy Meets the Future

**Connecting to Weeks 1-4:** Over the past four weeks, you've built a comprehensive framework for sports business:
- **Week 1:** Five revenue streams (media 40-60%, ticketing 20-30%, sponsorship 15-25%, merchandise 5-10%, betting 2-8%) and ecosystem thinking—understanding how these streams interconnect
- **Week 2:** Media rights valuation using CPM, dynamic pricing, and the fan engagement value chain (passive → engaged → super-fan)
- **Week 3:** Sponsorship ROI calculation, the 2-3× activation rule, and CAC/LTV benchmarks from FanDuel ($400 CAC, 8:1 LTV ratio)
- **Week 4:** Athlete brand portfolios, equity vs. fees decision-making, and women's sports investment thesis

This week, you'll apply ALL of these frameworks to **heritage properties**—organizations where the past has economic value and authenticity is the primary asset.

Throughout this course, you've explored the business mechanisms that power professional sport—
from revenue streams to media rights, sponsorships to athlete brands. This week, we bring
it all together by examining the institutions that endure: heritage organizations that leverage
100 years of tradition while racing to stay relevant in a digitally-native world.

Professional sports organizations face a unique strategic challenge. Unlike most businesses,
they carry the weight of history. Fans don't just follow teams for this season—they carry
family memories, generational pride, and emotional investments spanning decades. The Hockey
Hall of Fame isn't just a museum; it's a brand asset worth hundreds of millions. A storied
franchise's heritage is both a treasure and a constraint: it creates fan loyalty but can also
limit innovation.

This week, you'll explore how the most successful sports organizations navigate this paradox.
How do you honor 50 years of tradition while pivoting to streaming-first audiences? How do
you grow women's sports while managing legacy revenue streams? How do you integrate AI and
sustainability into a brand built on nostalgia? These aren't hypothetical questions—they're
the strategic challenges facing every major sports property today, and they're critical to
understanding the future of sports business.


### Element 3: Tiles Content
Create 4 tiles:

**Tile 1 - Title:** "Heritage Assets & Brand History"
**Tile 1 - Description:** "How legacy, tradition, and historical identity create sustainable competitive advantage and fan loyalty across generations."

**Tile 2 - Title:** "Tradition vs. Innovation Balance"
**Tile 2 - Description:** "Strategic tension between preserving what works and adopting new technologies, business models, and fan engagement approaches."

**Tile 3 - Title:** "Emerging Trends & Market Forces"
**Tile 3 - Description:** "Growth of women's sports, technology integration (AI, metaverse), sustainability demands, and demographic shifts reshaping the industry."

**Tile 4 - Title:** "Strategic Vision Development"
**Tile 4 - Description:** "Anchor Project Milestone 4: Craft a 5-year plan that integrates heritage positioning with future market opportunities and stakeholder needs."

**Design Rationale:**
- **ⓘ Infobox (Callout)** makes learning objectives visible and framed (QM Standard 2, UDL engagement)
- **Text** provides narrative context showing WHY Week 5 matters as capstone (UDL representation)
- **◫ Tiles** create visual preview of four strategic dimensions (UDL engagement, scannable overview, anchor project integration)
- Students immediately understand Week 5's synthesis role and capstone nature

## Module 1 Complete - Transition to Module 2

**What You've Accomplished:**
You now understand that Week 5 is the capstone week where everything comes together. You've seen
the four learning objectives that will help you think strategically about heritage properties and
future-focused sports business. You recognize that the central tension of modern sports business
isn't choosing between tradition OR innovation—it's learning to orchestrate both.

**Key Insight:**
The most valuable sports properties in the world are those that respect their heritage while
relentlessly evolving. They don't abandon their roots; they build on them. They don't reject
new technologies; they integrate them. This capstone week teaches you that strategic thinking
in sports is about seeing legacy and growth as complementary forces, not competing ones. This
mindset will set you apart in sports business leadership.

**Up Next: Module 2 - Executive Perspective**
Before diving into the Hockey Hall of Fame case study, you'll hear from executives who have
navigated this legacy-meets-innovation challenge in real time. They'll share how they've made
difficult strategic choices, managed stakeholder expectations, and positioned heritage brands
for sustainable growth. Their insights will frame everything you learn this week.

Ready to hear from leaders who balance tradition with transformation? Let's go!
