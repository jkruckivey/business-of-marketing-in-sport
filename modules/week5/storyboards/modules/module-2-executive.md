## Element 1: From Learning to Listening: Heritage Perspectives

**Title:** From Challenge to Expert Perspective

**Copy this markdown directly into Uplimit:**

## From Challenge to Expert Perspective

You've been introduced to the heritage monetization dilemma—the challenge every heritage sports property faces: How do you honor the past while competing in a growth-obsessed present?

**Connecting to Your Executive Journey:** Throughout this course, you've heard from executives who navigate these tensions daily:
- **Week 1 (Kevin Abrams + Stewart Johnston):** Revenue ecosystems and league strategy—how different streams interconnect, how commissioners think about expansion
- **Week 2 (Al Dark):** Media rights strategy, streaming vs. broadcast, fan engagement data
- **Week 3 (Andrew Sneyd):** Brand building, innovation, measuring what matters
- **Week 4 (Matt Rubinoff + Golf Canada):** Emerging sports, proof-of-concept, balancing growth with brand identity, NSO marketing

Now it's time to hear from the final executive perspective of this course. In this module, you'll hear from **Jamie Dinsmore, President & CEO of the Hockey Hall of Fame**—the guardian institution charged with preserving hockey's history and celebrating its greatest players.

Jamie represents a unique challenge: he manages an institution where preservation IS the business. Unlike the CFL or other leagues where growth is expected, the Hockey Hall of Fame must demonstrate that the past has genuine economic value. His approach—"Don't lose core, then look to grow"—captures the tension heritage properties face.

**Week 1 Connection:** Remember Stewart Johnston's interview from Week 1? His CFL expansion perspective directly supports your capstone project. After hearing Jamie's heritage institution approach, we'll revisit how Stewart's league-level thinking complements Jamie's institutional perspective. Both executives prioritize authenticity, but from very different angles.

**What to Watch For:** How does Jamie's four-revenue-line model differ from league revenue structures? What does 42% staff tenure at 25+ years tell us about heritage institution culture? How does his AR/VR vision serve (rather than replace) the Hall's core mission?

## Element 3: Video 1 - Jamie Dinsmore (Hockey Hall of Fame CEO) ✅ AVAILABLE

**File:** `Interviews/Jamie Dinsmore - President & CEO, Hockey Hall of Fame.mp4`
**Duration:** ~18 minutes
**Transcript:** `Interviews/Jamie Dinsmore - President & CEO, Hockey Hall of Fame.txt`
**Video Title:** "Jamie Dinsmore: Leading the Hockey Hall of Fame"
**Video Caption:** "Hockey Hall of Fame President & CEO shares insights on heritage institution management, four lines of business, and AR/VR vision for the future"

### Interview Content - Key Topics Covered:

**Career Journey & Background (00:00-04:00)** - Competitive nature from age 10, played every sport imaginable. Business career background before taking on HHOF role. "There's only one Hockey Hall of Fame"—role comes up once every few decades (previous CEO Jeff Denham served 27 years). Started July 1st, 2024.

**Mission & Business Model (04:00-08:00)** - Mission: "Honoring the legends, igniting fandom, expanding the game globally." Registered charity/not-for-profit status. Four lines of business:
- **Attraction (museum)**: ~$8.5M revenue
- **Events**: Corporate and personal events using the Hall after hours, ~$5M revenue
- **Retail**: Spirit of Hockey store, NHL merchandise, pucks, apparel
- **Outreach**: Cup movements, educational programs, bringing the Hall to communities

**Staff Passion & Culture (05:00-07:00)** - "People have been at the hall for a very long time." More staff at 20+ years than under 20 years. **42% have been here 25 years or more.** Deep passion for hockey and the institution.

**The Stanley Cup (13:00-15:00)** - "There's no trophy in all of sports that comes anywhere close to the Stanley Cup... it's the people's trophy. It's not just sitting in a museum behind glass." Visitors can touch it. Every winning player gets a trophy day. Stories connect generations.

**Growth Strategy (11:00-14:00)** - Physical expansion at Toronto location. International exhibits (Edmonton Oilers mini Hall of Fame at Rogers Place as model—could expand to 31+ NHL franchises). What can we do in Europe, Asia, south of the border? Women's hockey transformation. Diversity and inclusion stories.

**Technology Vision (22:00-26:00)** - "Low tech can be just as exciting as high tech"—storytelling is key. But AR/VR is exciting: "I think we're on the precipice of something really cool." Imagine experiencing Connor McDavid's speed virtually, or being the defenseman facing Marie-Philip Poulin's wrist shot. "Until you're in the game, at least virtually, you don't truly understand the speed and skill."

**Heritage Preservation Approach (27:00-29:00)** - Three principles:
1. Don't tarnish the brand
2. Operate professionally with everyone (internal, external, guests)
3. Be fiscally responsible

"Don't lose core and then look to grow... We're not throwing the baby out with the bathwater."

**Revenue & Growth Opportunities (14:00-16:00)** - Partnerships and sponsorships are key growth area. Elite stats: Less than 0.015% of sports players become professional. Less than 800 NHL skaters at any time. Only ~2% of eligible men make the Hall of Fame. "It's the elite of the elite."

**10-Year Vision (30:00-33:00)** - "I don't plan on doing anything but what I'm doing... you'll have to take me out in a time box." Primary innovation goal: AR/VR experiences that give people a different lens on the game—the "great equalizer" concept.

### Viewing Guide for Students:
- **Heritage Institution Business Model**: Four distinct revenue lines (attraction, events, retail, outreach) in a not-for-profit structure
- **Staff Culture as Asset**: 42% at 25+ years tenure—what does this mean for institutional knowledge and heritage preservation?
- **The Stanley Cup Strategy**: "People's trophy" approach—touchable, travels, creates generational stories
- **Technology as Enhancement**: AR/VR to help people "truly understand the speed and skill"—serving the mission, not replacing it
- **Heritage Preservation Principle**: "Don't lose core and then look to grow"

### Connection to Week 5 Themes:
- **WLO 5.1 (Heritage Properties as Revenue Assets)**: Four lines of business, $8.5M attraction + $5M events revenue
- **WLO 5.2 (Balancing Tradition with Innovation)**: "Don't lose core, then look to grow" + AR/VR vision
- **WLO 5.3 (Future Trends)**: AR/VR, international expansion, women's hockey growth

**Key Quotes:**
> "There's only one Hockey Hall of Fame... it only comes up once every few decades."

> "42% have been here 25 years or more."

> "There's no trophy in all of sports that comes anywhere close to the Stanley Cup... it's the people's trophy."

## Element 3A: Practice Quiz - Jamie Dinsmore Interview Check

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Exercise - Practice Quiz** element
2. Add 5 multiple choice questions based on Jamie's interview
3. Set as "Practice Quiz" (not graded) for self-assessment

---

### Question 1: Heritage Business Model

Jamie describes the Hockey Hall of Fame as operating with "four lines of business." Based on his interview, which revenue line generates the MOST revenue?

A) Retail (Spirit of Hockey store)
B) Attraction (museum admissions) ✅
C) Outreach (educational programs)
D) Events (corporate rentals)

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Jamie states that the Attraction line generates approximately $8.5M in revenue, making it the largest of the four business lines.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Review Jamie's description of the four lines of business. He mentions that the Attraction (museum) generates ~$8.5M, while Events generates ~$5M.

---

### Question 2: Staff Culture as Asset

Jamie reveals that 42% of Hockey Hall of Fame staff have been there for 25+ years. What does this suggest about heritage institutions?

A) They struggle to attract new talent
B) Institutional knowledge is a competitive advantage ✅
C) Staff salaries are below market rate
D) Innovation is not valued

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Jamie presents long staff tenure as an asset, not a problem. These employees have deep passion for hockey and irreplaceable institutional knowledge about the Hall's collection and operations.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Jamie frames staff tenure positively. He says "people have been at the hall for a very long time" as evidence of their passion and commitment, which creates institutional knowledge that can't be easily replaced.

---

### Question 3: The Stanley Cup Strategy

Jamie calls the Stanley Cup "the people's trophy." What does he mean by this phrase?

A) The Cup was purchased with public funds
B) Fans can touch it and it travels with winning players ✅
C) It's displayed in a public park, not a museum
D) Fans vote on who gets inducted

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Unlike most sports trophies kept "behind glass," the Stanley Cup is touchable by visitors, travels with each winning team member for their trophy day, and creates generational stories. This accessibility is a deliberate heritage strategy.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Review Jamie's explanation of the Cup's unique status. He emphasizes that visitors can physically touch it and that every winning player gets a "trophy day" where the Cup visits their hometown.

---

### Question 4: Innovation Philosophy

Jamie summarizes his approach to innovation with a key phrase. Which best captures his philosophy?

A) "Move fast and break things"
B) "Don't lose core, then look to grow" ✅
C) "Technology is the future"
D) "Tradition is our only asset"

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! This phrase captures Jamie's balanced approach: protect the institution's core heritage first, THEN explore growth opportunities. Innovation should serve the mission, not replace it.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Jamie uses the phrase "Don't lose core, then look to grow" multiple times to describe his strategic approach. It represents his commitment to preserving authenticity while being open to growth.

---

### Question 5: AR/VR Vision Application

Jamie is excited about AR/VR technology. Based on his interview, what is his primary goal for using AR/VR at the Hall?

A) Replace physical visits with virtual tours
B) Generate new revenue from gaming partnerships
C) Help fans truly understand the speed and skill of hockey ✅
D) Compete with entertainment venues like theme parks

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Jamie's AR/VR vision is about ENHANCEMENT, not replacement. He wants technology to help fans understand "until you're in the game, at least virtually, you don't truly understand the speed and skill" of elite hockey players.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Jamie specifically says AR/VR should help people "truly understand the speed and skill" of hockey. He sees technology as a tool for deeper appreciation of the game, not as a replacement for the physical museum experience.

## Element 4: Revisit Week 1 - Stewart Johnston Connection ⭐ CAPSTONE

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Infobox (Callout)** element in module builder
2. Use **Yellow variant** (important callback)
3. Copy the content below

```
Title: 🔗 Capstone Connection: Revisit Stewart Johnston from Week 1

Before completing your CFL expansion project, revisit Stewart Johnston's interview from Week 1, Module 2. His perspective on league leadership and expansion strategy provides the framework for your capstone brand package.

**Why This Matters:**
In Week 1, you heard Stewart alongside Kevin Abrams to understand how sports organizations generate and manage revenue. Now, with 4 weeks of additional context, Stewart's expansion insights become actionable for your capstone project.

**Key Segments to Revisit:**

📍 **Three Strategic Priorities (22:00-28:00)**
- Entertainment: Machine Gun Kelly halftime, music integration
- Youth engagement: Getting footballs into kids' hands
- Profitability: Creating nine profitable teams ("we're not there yet")

📍 **10-Year Vision & Expansion (28:00-35:00)**
- Expansion NOT in top 3 priorities, but expects 10th team within 10 years
- "Great markets across this country that could support a team"
- Brand positioning as key strategic goal

**Apply to Your Capstone:**
When designing your CFL expansion franchise, demonstrate how your market addresses Stewart's priorities:
1. Does the expansion enhance entertainment value?
2. Does it grow youth engagement?
3. Can the 10th team be profitable?
4. How does it strengthen CFL's brand positioning?

**Comparing Executives:**
Notice how Jamie's heritage institution approach ("Don't lose core, then look to grow") complements Stewart's league expansion thinking. Both prioritize authenticity, but Jamie is conservative (preservation IS the business) while Stewart balances tradition with growth imperatives across nine stakeholder-owners.

**Location:** Week 1, Module 2 (Executive Perspectives: Kevin Abrams & Stewart Johnston)
**File:** `Interviews/Stewart Johnston - Commissioner, Canadian Football League.mp4`
**Duration:** ~35 minutes

**Quick Reference - Stewart's Key Points:**
| Topic | Timestamp | Key Insight |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Commissioner as CEO | 04:30-10:00 | "This is a CEO job" - accountable to nine owners |

| Three priorities | 22:00-28:00 | Entertainment, youth, profitability |
| Expansion vision | 28:00-35:00 | 10th team within 10 years |

**Recommended Review Time:** 10-15 minutes (focus on 22:00-35:00 for capstone relevance)

## Element 5: Practice Quiz - Executive Synthesis Check

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Exercise - Practice Quiz** element
2. Add 3 synthesis questions comparing Jamie (Week 5) with Stewart (Week 1)
3. Set as "Practice Quiz" (not graded) for self-assessment

---

### Synthesis Question 1: Common Ground

Despite leading very different organizations (museum vs. league), Jamie Dinsmore (Week 5) and Stewart Johnston (Week 1) share which fundamental belief?

A) Technology should replace traditional experiences
B) Innovation must serve authenticity, not replace it ✅
C) Revenue growth always takes priority over heritage
D) Expansion is the best path to growth

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Both executives emphasize that innovation should SERVE their organization's core purpose. Jamie says "don't lose core, then look to grow." Stewart emphasizes respecting passionate traditionalist fans while growing. Neither supports innovation that compromises authenticity.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Look for the common thread in both interviews. Despite different contexts, both Jamie and Stewart prioritize authenticity and believe innovation should enhance (not replace) their organizations' heritage.

---

### Synthesis Question 2: Key Difference

What is the PRIMARY difference between Jamie Dinsmore's and Stewart Johnston's strategic constraints?

A) Jamie has more money to invest
B) Stewart faces more stakeholders with competing interests ✅
C) Jamie's organization is younger
D) Stewart has no heritage to protect

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Jamie manages one institution with relatively aligned stakeholders (curatorial staff, donors who share preservation values). Stewart manages NINE team owners with competing interests—each wanting profitability, each in different markets. This multi-stakeholder complexity makes Stewart's decisions more politically challenging.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Consider who each executive answers to. Jamie has curatorial staff and donors who generally share his preservation values. Stewart has nine team owners, each with their own market conditions and business pressures. This creates very different decision-making dynamics.

---

### Synthesis Question 3: Applying to Your Capstone

When designing your CFL expansion proposal, which insight from BOTH executives (Jamie from Week 5, Stewart from Week 1) should guide your strategy?

A) Prioritize technology investment above all else
B) Focus only on maximizing short-term revenue
C) Balance growth initiatives with authentic brand positioning ✅
D) Ignore existing fan traditions

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Both executives teach that successful heritage property strategy requires balance. Your CFL expansion proposal should show how a new franchise can grow the league (revenue, markets, youth engagement) while STRENGTHENING the CFL's authentic brand positioning—not diluting it. This is the synthesis of your entire course journey.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Your capstone should reflect the key lesson from both executives: growth and authenticity aren't opposites. The best expansion strategy grows the CFL while strengthening its brand positioning and respecting its heritage.

## Module 2 Complete - Transition to Module 3

**What You've Learned:**

You've now heard from Jamie Dinsmore on heritage institution strategy, and revisited Stewart Johnston's Week 1 insights for your capstone project:

- **Jamie Dinsmore (Week 5)** protects an institution where the PAST has economic value. He must carefully preserve authenticity while achieving financial sustainability. His stakeholders (curatorial staff, donors, partner leagues) have veto power over strategy, forcing a conservative but defensible approach. His principle: "Don't lose core, then look to grow."

- **Stewart Johnston (Week 1 Revisit)** leads a league where PASSIONATE TRADITIONALISTS must be respected while growing new audiences. He balances nine competing team owners, media partnerships, and a 100+ year heritage with expansion ambitions. His three priorities: entertainment, youth engagement, and nine profitable teams.

**Key Insights from This Module:**

1. **Heritage institutions and leagues face different strategic constraints**, even though both manage heritage properties
2. **Authenticity is a business asset**, not just a cultural value—it drives revenue and stakeholder relationships
3. **Stakeholders determine your strategic freedom**—different accountability structures lead to different growth models
4. **Purpose-driven innovation is the unifying principle**—the best strategies SERVE the organization's core mission
5. **Expansion requires strategic readiness**—Stewart's three priorities (entertainment, youth, profitability) must be achieved before expansion

**The Emerging Framework:**

Both executives validate the decision principle:
- ✅ If innovation SERVES authenticity and extends the organization's core mission → Approved
- ❌ If innovation REPLACES authenticity with pure entertainment ("Disneyfication") → Rejected

The difference is in HOW MUCH RISK you can take, given your stakeholder constraints and growth expectations.

**Capstone Connection:**
Your course journey with executives has come full circle. Stewart's Week 1 expansion perspective, now revisited with 4 weeks of additional context, directly informs your CFL brand package project. His three priorities become your evaluation criteria: Does your expansion proposal enhance entertainment value? Grow youth engagement? Create a profitable 10th team? Strengthen CFL brand positioning?

**Up Next: Module 3 - Core Content & Interactive Frameworks**

Now that you've heard real-world perspective from experienced executives across all five weeks, Module 3 will teach you the systematic frameworks for making these trade-off decisions yourself. You'll learn the **Legacy vs. Innovation Matrix** to map strategic initiatives, the **Heritage Property Analyzer** to model revenue scenarios, and the **Future Trends Simulator** to forecast how emerging trends will impact heritage properties.
