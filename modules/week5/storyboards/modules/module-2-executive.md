## Element 1: From Learning to Listening: Heritage Perspectives

**Title:** From Challenge to Expert Perspective

**Copy this markdown directly into Uplimit:**

## From Challenge to Expert Perspective

You've been introduced to the heritage monetization dilemma—the challenge every heritage sports property faces: How do you honor the past while competing in a growth-obsessed present?

**Connecting to Weeks 1-4:** As you listen to this week's executives, notice how they apply frameworks you've already learned:
- **Week 1 (Kevin Abrams):** Revenue ecosystems—how different streams interconnect in a $10B organization
- **Week 2 (Al Dark):** Media rights strategy, streaming vs. broadcast, fan engagement data
- **Week 3 (Andrew Sneyd):** Brand building, innovation, measuring what matters
- **Week 4 (Matt Rubinoff + Golf Canada):** Emerging sports, proof-of-concept, balancing growth with brand identity, NSO marketing

Now it's time to hear from two executives who live these tensions every day. In this module, you'll encounter a dialogue between complementary perspectives on what makes heritage properties valuable, how to grow them without losing their soul, and how to lead into the future.

First, you'll hear from **Jamie Dinsmore, President & CEO of the Hockey Hall of Fame**—the guardian institution charged with preserving hockey's history and celebrating its greatest players. Then, you'll hear from **Stewart Johnston, Commissioner of the Canadian Football League**—leading a heritage league through transformation while planning for expansion.

Both leaders face heritage property challenges, but from different angles:
- **Jamie** manages an institution where preservation IS the business (the past has economic value)
- **Stewart** manages a 100+ year league balancing passionate traditionalist fans with growth imperatives and expansion opportunities

Their insights will reveal the real trade-offs, the constraints that frameworks can't capture, and the human dimensions of heritage strategy that come from decades of executive decision-making.

**Capstone Connection:** Listen carefully for where they agree (both prioritize authenticity), where they diverge (on how much innovation is appropriate), and how Stewart's league expansion perspective directly connects to your CFL expansion project.

Title: ◉ Executive Insights: Heritage Property Strategy - Two Perspectives

This module features two executive sessions that bring real-world perspective to the heritage vs. innovation vs. expansion tensions. You'll hear from leaders who have made multi-million dollar decisions on exactly the trade-offs you're studying this week—plus critical context for your capstone CFL expansion project.

**Session 1: Jamie Dinsmore (HHOF CEO) (~18 min)** ✅ AVAILABLE
- Role: President & CEO, Hockey Hall of Fame (started July 2024)
- Challenge: Growing a heritage institution without losing authenticity
- Perspective: Four revenue lines, staff tenure as asset, Stanley Cup as "people's trophy"
- Focus: "Don't lose core, then look to grow"

**Session 2: Stewart Johnston (CFL Commissioner) (~35 min)** ✅ AVAILABLE ⭐ CAPSTONE
- Role: League commissioner leading heritage league through transformation
- Challenge: Balance passionate 30-40 year fans with growth imperatives and expansion opportunities

## Element 3: Video 1 - Jamie Dinsmore (Hockey Hall of Fame CEO) ✅ AVAILABLE

**File:** `Interviews/Jamie Dinsmore - President & CEO, Hockey Hall of Fame.mp4`
**Duration:** ~18 minutes
**Transcript:** `Interviews/Jamie Dinsmore - President & CEO, Hockey Hall of Fame.txt`
**Video Title:** "Jamie Dinsmore: Leading the Hockey Hall of Fame"
**Video Caption:** "Hockey Hall of Fame President & CEO shares insights on heritage institution management, four lines of business, and AR/VR vision for the future"

### Interview Content - Key Topics Covered:

**Career Journey & Background (00:00-04:00)** - Competitive nature from age 10, played every sport imaginable. Business career background before taking on HHOF role. "There's only one Hockey Hall of Fame"—role comes up once every few decades (previous CEO Jeff Denham served 27 years). Started July 1st, 2024.

**Mission & Business Model (04:00-08:00)** - Mission: "Honoring the legends, igniting fandom, expanding the game globally." Registered charity/not-for-profit status. Four lines of business:
- **Attraction (museum)**: ~$8.5M revenue
- **Events**: Corporate and personal events using the Hall after hours, ~$5M revenue
- **Retail**: Spirit of Hockey store, NHL merchandise, pucks, apparel
- **Outreach**: Cup movements, educational programs, bringing the Hall to communities

**Staff Passion & Culture (05:00-07:00)** - "People have been at the hall for a very long time." More staff at 20+ years than under 20 years. **42% have been here 25 years or more.** Deep passion for hockey and the institution.

**The Stanley Cup (13:00-15:00)** - "There's no trophy in all of sports that comes anywhere close to the Stanley Cup... it's the people's trophy. It's not just sitting in a museum behind glass." Visitors can touch it. Every winning player gets a trophy day. Stories connect generations.

**Growth Strategy (11:00-14:00)** - Physical expansion at Toronto location. International exhibits (Edmonton Oilers mini Hall of Fame at Rogers Place as model—could expand to 31+ NHL franchises). What can we do in Europe, Asia, south of the border? Women's hockey transformation. Diversity and inclusion stories.

**Technology Vision (22:00-26:00)** - "Low tech can be just as exciting as high tech"—storytelling is key. But AR/VR is exciting: "I think we're on the precipice of something really cool." Imagine experiencing Connor McDavid's speed virtually, or being the defenseman facing Marie-Philip Poulin's wrist shot. "Until you're in the game, at least virtually, you don't truly understand the speed and skill."

**Heritage Preservation Approach (27:00-29:00)** - Three principles:
1. Don't tarnish the brand
2. Operate professionally with everyone (internal, external, guests)
3. Be fiscally responsible

"Don't lose core and then look to grow... We're not throwing the baby out with the bathwater."

**Revenue & Growth Opportunities (14:00-16:00)** - Partnerships and sponsorships are key growth area. Elite stats: Less than 0.015% of sports players become professional. Less than 800 NHL skaters at any time. Only ~2% of eligible men make the Hall of Fame. "It's the elite of the elite."

**10-Year Vision (30:00-33:00)** - "I don't plan on doing anything but what I'm doing... you'll have to take me out in a time box." Primary innovation goal: AR/VR experiences that give people a different lens on the game—the "great equalizer" concept.

### Viewing Guide for Students:
- **Heritage Institution Business Model**: Four distinct revenue lines (attraction, events, retail, outreach) in a not-for-profit structure
- **Staff Culture as Asset**: 42% at 25+ years tenure—what does this mean for institutional knowledge and heritage preservation?
- **The Stanley Cup Strategy**: "People's trophy" approach—touchable, travels, creates generational stories
- **Technology as Enhancement**: AR/VR to help people "truly understand the speed and skill"—serving the mission, not replacing it
- **Heritage Preservation Principle**: "Don't lose core and then look to grow"

### Connection to Week 5 Themes:
- **WLO 5.1 (Heritage Properties as Revenue Assets)**: Four lines of business, $8.5M attraction + $5M events revenue
- **WLO 5.2 (Balancing Tradition with Innovation)**: "Don't lose core, then look to grow" + AR/VR vision
- **WLO 5.3 (Future Trends)**: AR/VR, international expansion, women's hockey growth

> "There's only one Hockey Hall of Fame... it only comes up once every few decades."

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Exercise - Practice Quiz** element
2. Add 5 multiple choice questions based on Jamie's interview
3. Set as "Practice Quiz" (not graded) for self-assessment

---

### Question 1: Heritage Business Model

Jamie describes the Hockey Hall of Fame as operating with "four lines of business." Based on his interview, which revenue line generates the MOST revenue?

A) Retail (Spirit of Hockey store)
B) Attraction (museum admissions) ✅
C) Outreach (educational programs)
D) Events (corporate rentals)

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Jamie states that the Attraction line generates approximately $8.5M in revenue, making it the largest of the four business lines.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Review Jamie's description of the four lines of business. He mentions that the Attraction (museum) generates ~$8.5M, while Events generates ~$5M.

---

### Question 2: Staff Culture as Asset

Jamie reveals that 42% of Hockey Hall of Fame staff have been there for 25+ years. What does this suggest about heritage institutions?

A) They struggle to attract new talent
B) Institutional knowledge is a competitive advantage ✅
C) Staff salaries are below market rate
D) Innovation is not valued

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Jamie presents long staff tenure as an asset, not a problem. These employees have deep passion for hockey and irreplaceable institutional knowledge about the Hall's collection and operations.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Jamie frames staff tenure positively. He says "people have been at the hall for a very long time" as evidence of their passion and commitment, which creates institutional knowledge that can't be easily replaced.

---

### Question 3: The Stanley Cup Strategy

Jamie calls the Stanley Cup "the people's trophy." What does he mean by this phrase?

A) The Cup was purchased with public funds
B) Fans can touch it and it travels with winning players ✅
C) It's displayed in a public park, not a museum
D) Fans vote on who gets inducted

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Unlike most sports trophies kept "behind glass," the Stanley Cup is touchable by visitors, travels with each winning team member for their trophy day, and creates generational stories. This accessibility is a deliberate heritage strategy.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Review Jamie's explanation of the Cup's unique status. He emphasizes that visitors can physically touch it and that every winning player gets a "trophy day" where the Cup visits their hometown.

---

### Question 4: Innovation Philosophy

Jamie summarizes his approach to innovation with a key phrase. Which best captures his philosophy?

A) "Move fast and break things"
B) "Don't lose core, then look to grow" ✅
C) "Technology is the future"
D) "Tradition is our only asset"

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! This phrase captures Jamie's balanced approach: protect the institution's core heritage first, THEN explore growth opportunities. Innovation should serve the mission, not replace it.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Jamie uses the phrase "Don't lose core, then look to grow" multiple times to describe his strategic approach. It represents his commitment to preserving authenticity while being open to growth.

---

### Question 5: AR/VR Vision Application

Jamie is excited about AR/VR technology. Based on his interview, what is his primary goal for using AR/VR at the Hall?

A) Replace physical visits with virtual tours
B) Generate new revenue from gaming partnerships
C) Help fans truly understand the speed and skill of hockey ✅
D) Compete with entertainment venues like theme parks

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Jamie's AR/VR vision is about ENHANCEMENT, not replacement. He wants technology to help fans understand "until you're in the game, at least virtually, you don't truly understand the speed and skill" of elite hockey players.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Jamie specifically says AR/VR should help people "truly understand the speed and skill" of hockey. He sees technology as a tool for deeper appreciation of the game, not as a replacement for the physical museum experience.

**File:** `Interviews/Stewart Johnston - Commissioner, Canadian Football League.mp4`
**Duration:** ~35 minutes
**Transcript:** `Interviews/Stewart Johnston - Commissioner, Canadian Football League.txt`
**Video Title:** "Stewart Johnston: Leading the CFL into the Future - Tradition, Growth & Expansion"
**Video Caption:** "CFL Commissioner Stewart Johnston discusses balancing passionate traditional fans with growth imperatives, media rights strategy, and his 10-year vision including league expansion"

### Interview Content - Key Topics Covered:

**Career Journey & TSN/Bell Background (00:00-04:30)** - 27 years at Bell Media/TSN, led 3,600+ person team across entertainment, news, sports, and ad sales. Deep CFL partnership history from the media side before transitioning to commissioner role.

**Commissioner as CEO Role (04:30-10:00)** - Approaches role as CEO, not just figurehead. Primary revenue drivers: media rights and commercial partnerships. Gate revenue critical for teams. Accountability to nine team owners who "have to deliver returns."

**Media Rights & Revenue Strategy (10:00-15:00)** - Media rights and sponsorship as league's biggest revenue buckets. Ratings as fandom indicator. Must make content "so valuable" it drives subscriptions AND advertising. Explains negotiation dynamics when media partners evaluate CFL value.

**Tradition vs. Innovation Challenge (15:00-22:00)** - Core challenge: loyal 30-40 year season ticket holders vs. need to grow new customer base. "Not unique to CFL" - many industries face this. Must respect passionate traditionalist fans while innovating to attract younger audiences.

**Three Strategic Priorities (22:00-28:00)** - (1) Relentless focus on entertainment (Machine Gun Kelly halftime, music integration), (2) Getting footballs into kids' hands (youth engagement), (3) Creating nine profitable teams ("we're not there yet"). Olympics flag football as growth opportunity.

**10-Year Vision & Expansion (28:00-35:00)** - Expansion NOT in top 3 priorities, but expects 10th team within 10 years. "Great markets across this country that could support a team." Hopes to be recognized as "top tier professional sports league in North America." Brand positioning as key strategic goal.

### Capstone Project Connection:
Stewart's interview provides direct insight into how a commissioner thinks about expansion. When students design their CFL expansion franchise brand package, they should consider Stewart's priorities:
1. Does the expansion enhance entertainment value?
2. Does it grow youth engagement?
3. Can the 10th team be profitable?
4. How does it strengthen CFL's brand positioning?

### Viewing Guide for Students:
- **League Leadership:** CEO mindset vs. ceremonial commissioner role
- **Revenue Model:** Media rights + sponsorship as primary league-level revenue (gate for teams)
- **Tradition/Innovation Balance:** Same tension as HHOF/MLSE but at league scale with passionate fans
- **Expansion Criteria:** What makes a market "great" for expansion? Profitability, brand fit, fan passion
- **10-Year Vision:** How commissioners think strategically about league positioning

3. Set as "Practice Quiz" (not graded) for self-assessment

---

### Question 1: Commissioner Role

A) A ceremonial figurehead role
B) A CEO position with real accountability ✅
C) A mediator between team owners
D) A public relations spokesperson

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Stewart emphasizes: "This is a CEO job." He's accountable to nine team owners who expect growth and profitability, not just someone who "kisses babies and takes pictures."

---

B) Media rights and commercial sponsorships ✅
C) Broadcasting fees and player transfers
D) Licensing deals and stadium operations

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Stewart states: "The two biggest drivers of revenue at the league office are within the media rights and commercial partnerships with sponsors." Gate revenue goes to individual teams, not the league.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Review Stewart's discussion of league-level revenue. He emphasizes that media rights and commercial partnerships (sponsorships) are his primary focus as commissioner.

---

### Question 3: Strategic Priorities

Stewart identifies three strategic priorities for the CFL. Which is NOT one of his top three priorities?

A) Relentless focus on entertainment
B) Getting footballs into kids' hands (youth engagement)

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Stewart explicitly states that expansion is NOT in his top 3 priorities, even though he expects a 10th team within 10 years. His priorities are: (1) entertainment, (2) youth engagement, and (3) nine profitable teams.

B) They're 30-40 year season ticket holders who are passionately loyal ✅
C) They're casual viewers who tune in occasionally
D) They're primarily international audiences

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Stewart describes the challenge of serving loyal 30-40 year season ticket holders who are "absolutely passionate" while also growing new audiences. This creates a tradition vs. innovation tension.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Stewart specifically mentions that the CFL's core fans are long-term (30-40 year) season ticket holders. This creates a strategic challenge: how to grow new audiences without alienating passionate traditionalists.

---

### Question 5: Expansion Timeline

What is Stewart's expectation for CFL expansion?

A) No expansion is planned
B) 10th team within 10 years ✅
C) Immediate expansion to 12 teams

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Stewart discusses a realistic timeline for expansion. He's not rushing it (not top 3 priority), but he expects the league to have a 10th team within the next decade.

---

### Question 6: Capstone Application

Based on Stewart's interview, which factor is MOST important when evaluating a CFL expansion market?

A) The city's population size alone
B) Alignment with the three strategic priorities (entertainment, youth, profitability) ✅
C) Proximity to existing CFL teams
D) The number of hockey fans in the market

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Your CFL expansion proposal should demonstrate how your market enhances entertainment value, grows youth engagement, and can be profitable. Stewart's three priorities become your evaluation criteria.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Stewart's three priorities (entertainment, youth engagement, profitability) should guide expansion decisions. A great market is one where the expansion team advances these priorities, not just one with a large population.

## Element 5A: Practice Quiz - Executive Synthesis Check

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Exercise - Practice Quiz** element
2. Add 3 synthesis questions comparing both executives
3. Set as "Practice Quiz" (not graded) for self-assessment

---

### Synthesis Question 1: Common Ground

Despite leading very different organizations (museum vs. league), Jamie Dinsmore and Stewart Johnston share which fundamental belief?

A) Technology should replace traditional experiences
B) Innovation must serve authenticity, not replace it ✅
C) Revenue growth always takes priority over heritage
D) Expansion is the best path to growth

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Both executives emphasize that innovation should SERVE their organization's core purpose. Jamie says "don't lose core, then look to grow." Stewart emphasizes respecting passionate traditionalist fans while growing. Neither supports innovation that compromises authenticity.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Look for the common thread in both interviews. Despite different contexts, both Jamie and Stewart prioritize authenticity and believe innovation should enhance (not replace) their organizations' heritage.

---

### Synthesis Question 2: Key Difference

What is the PRIMARY difference between Jamie Dinsmore's and Stewart Johnston's strategic constraints?

A) Jamie has more money to invest
B) Stewart faces more stakeholders with competing interests ✅
C) Jamie's organization is younger
D) Stewart has no heritage to protect

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Jamie manages one institution with relatively aligned stakeholders (curatorial staff, donors who share preservation values). Stewart manages NINE team owners with competing interests—each wanting profitability, each in different markets. This multi-stakeholder complexity makes Stewart's decisions more politically challenging.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Consider who each executive answers to. Jamie has curatorial staff and donors who generally share his preservation values. Stewart has nine team owners, each with their own market conditions and business pressures. This creates very different decision-making dynamics.

---

### Synthesis Question 3: Applying to Your Capstone

When designing your CFL expansion proposal, which insight from BOTH executives should guide your strategy?

A) Prioritize technology investment above all else
B) Focus only on maximizing short-term revenue
C) Balance growth initiatives with authentic brand positioning ✅
D) Ignore existing fan traditions

**Feedback (Correct):** Correct! Both executives teach that successful heritage property strategy requires balance. Your CFL expansion proposal should show how a new franchise can grow the league (revenue, markets, youth engagement) while STRENGTHENING the CFL's authentic brand positioning—not diluting it. This is the synthesis of Week 5.

**Feedback (Incorrect):** Your capstone should reflect the key lesson from both executives: growth and authenticity aren't opposites. The best expansion strategy grows the CFL while strengthening its brand positioning and respecting its heritage.

### Why We Provide Transcripts

These video transcripts are provided for:
- **Accessibility**: Students using screen readers or with hearing impairments
- **Searchability**: Easy reference to find specific points from each executive
- **Learning preference**: Students who prefer reading to watching
- **Review**: Quick way to revisit key concepts without rewatching full videos

Both executives cover similar frameworks (heritage value, stakeholder relationships, innovation strategy) but from fundamentally different perspectives. Reading transcripts side-by-side can help you see where their philosophies align and diverge.

## Module 2 Complete - Transition to Module 3

**What You've Learned:**

You've now heard from two executives who navigate heritage property strategy from different perspectives:

- **Jamie Dinsmore** protects an institution where the PAST has economic value. He must carefully preserve authenticity while achieving financial sustainability. His stakeholders (curatorial staff, donors, partner leagues) have veto power over strategy, forcing a conservative but defensible approach. His principle: "Don't lose core, then look to grow."

- **Stewart Johnston** leads a league where PASSIONATE TRADITIONALISTS must be respected while growing new audiences. He balances nine competing team owners, media partnerships, and a 100+ year heritage with expansion ambitions. His three priorities: entertainment, youth engagement, and nine profitable teams.

**Key Insights from This Module:**

1. **Heritage institutions and leagues face different strategic constraints**, even though both manage heritage properties
2. **Authenticity is a business asset**, not just a cultural value—it drives revenue and stakeholder relationships
3. **Stakeholders determine your strategic freedom**—different accountability structures lead to different growth models
4. **Purpose-driven innovation is the unifying principle**—the best strategies SERVE the organization's core mission
5. **Expansion requires strategic readiness**—Stewart's three priorities (entertainment, youth, profitability) must be achieved before expansion

**The Emerging Framework:**

Both executives validate the decision principle:
- ✅ If innovation SERVES authenticity and extends the organization's core mission → Approved
- ❌ If innovation REPLACES authenticity with pure entertainment ("Disneyfication") → Rejected

The difference is in HOW MUCH RISK you can take, given your stakeholder constraints and growth expectations.

**Capstone Connection:**
Stewart's expansion perspective directly informs your CFL brand package project. His three priorities become your evaluation criteria: Does your expansion proposal enhance entertainment value? Grow youth engagement? Create a profitable 10th team? Strengthen CFL brand positioning?

**Up Next: Module 3 - Core Content & Interactive Frameworks**

Now that you've heard real-world perspective from two experienced executives, Module 3 will teach you the systematic frameworks for making these trade-off decisions yourself. You'll learn the **Legacy vs. Innovation Matrix** to map strategic initiatives, the **Heritage Property Analyzer** to model revenue scenarios, and the **Future Trends Simulator** to forecast how emerging trends will impact heritage properties.
