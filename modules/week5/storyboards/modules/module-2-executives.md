## Element 1: Connecting Introduction Text

**Copy this markdown directly into Uplimit:**


You've been introduced to the heritage monetization dilemma—the challenge every heritage sports property faces: How do you honor the past while competing in a growth-obsessed present?

Now it's time to hear from two executives who live this tension every day. In this module, you'll encounter a unique learning experience: a counterpoint dialogue between two perspectives on what makes heritage properties valuable and how to grow them without losing their soul.

First, you'll hear from **Jamie Dinsmore, President & CEO of the Hockey Hall of Fame**—the guardian institution charged with preserving hockey's history and celebrating its greatest players. Then, you'll hear from **Keith Pelley, President and CEO of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE)**—a modern sports franchise operator who owns both the Maple Leafs and Raptors and understands the business of growth and fan engagement.

Both leaders face heritage property challenges, but from opposite directions:
- **Jamie** manages an institution where preservation IS the business (the past has economic value)
- **Keith** manages franchises where the future drives value (current performance and innovation create revenue)

Their insights will reveal the real trade-offs, the constraints that frameworks can't capture, and the human dimensions of heritage strategy that come from two decades of executive decision-making.

Listen carefully for where they agree (both prioritize authenticity) and where they diverge (on how much innovation is too much).

Title: ◉ Executive Insights: Heritage Property Strategy - Two Perspectives

This module features two recorded executive sessions that bring real-world perspective to the heritage vs. innovation tension. You'll hear from leaders who have made multi-million dollar decisions on exactly the trade-offs you're studying this week.

**Session 1: Jamie Dinsmore (Hockey Hall of Fame CEO)**
- Role: Steward of hockey's history and institutional credibility
- Challenge: How to grow revenue (declining attendance, flat donations) without "Disneyfication"
- Perspective: Heritage preservation creates economic value; once lost, it can't be recovered
- Focus: Boundary-setting and stakeholder relationships

**Session 2: Keith Pelley (MLSE President & CEO)**
- Role: Operator of modern sports franchises rooted in storied history
- Challenge: How to honor Maple Leafs/Raptors legacy while competing in a digital, global market
- Perspective: Heritage creates emotional connection that drives ALL revenue streams
- Focus: Integration of tradition with aggressive innovation

**What to Watch For:**
- Both executives emphasize AUTHENTICITY as a business asset, not just a cultural value
- Differences in risk tolerance: Heritage institutions are more conservative; franchises are more aggressive
- Common language around "stewardship" and "knowing your limits"
- Real examples of decisions they've made on sponsorships, digital experiences, international expansion

**Total Viewing Time:** 24-30 minutes (two 12-15 minute sessions)
**Discussion Time:** 15-20 minutes (reflection and comparison)
**Total Module 2 Time:** 40-50 minutes

**FULL SCRIPT:**


[OPENING - 0:00-2:00]
[ON-SCREEN: Jamie Dinsmore in Hockey Hall of Fame setting, Great Hall visible in background]

JAMIE:
"Hi, I'm Jamie Dinsmore, President and CEO of the Hockey Hall of Fame. I've spent
the last 15+ years working in heritage sports properties—before HHOF, I worked with
the Baseball Hall of Fame and Olympic legacy properties.

So I've made a lot of decisions about where to draw the line between growth and
authenticity. I've approved some innovations that succeeded brilliantly. I've rejected
others that would have generated millions but cost us something more valuable: credibility.

Today, I want to share the real trade-offs and constraints that don't fit neatly into
a PowerPoint framework."

[SECTION 1: AUTHENTICITY AS ECONOMIC VALUE - 2:00-6:00]
[ON-SCREEN: Jamie walking through HHOF exhibits, discussing displays]

JAMIE:
"Here's the fundamental difference between heritage institutions and professional teams:
For us, the PAST has economic value. It's not just nostalgia—it's literally what people
pay to experience.

A professional team's value comes from current performance. The Toronto Maple Leafs are
valuable because they might win the Stanley Cup in the future. Their 1967 championship is
nice history, but it doesn't drive current revenue.

For the Hockey Hall of Fame, the opposite is true. Wayne Gretzky's 894th goal? That's
pure history, and it's why someone buys a ticket to visit us. The authenticity of that
artifact—knowing it's REAL, knowing we're the authoritative institution on hockey's
history—that authenticity is our entire value proposition.

[VISUAL: Close-up of Gretzky's stick in display case]

So when someone proposes 'Let's build a VR experience where people play HOCKEY AS GRETZKY,'
I hear two very different things than my colleagues at the Maple Leafs do:

A Maple Leafs executive hears: 'A new revenue stream that engages younger audiences,
drives engagement, and creates a unique experience.' That's true!

I hear: 'We're monetizing Gretzky's legacy by turning him into a theme park attraction.'
And that costs something that can't be recovered. Once our donors and partners believe we
prioritize revenue over reverence, we've lost credibility. And credibility IS our business.

[Pause]

This is the heritage institution constraint: Some revenue opportunities must be rejected
because accepting them would compromise the authenticity that makes us valuable.

Revenue optimization is necessary—we're a business, and we face real financial pressures.
But it's not sufficient. We have an additional filter: Does this preserve our credibility
as the authoritative guardian of hockey's history?

If the answer is 'Not sure,' we don't do it."

---

[SECTION 2: THE DISNEYFICATION TRAP - 6:00-9:30]
[VISUAL: Split screen showing museums with high commercialization vs. authentic heritage properties]

JAMIE:
"Let me give you concrete examples of where other heritage institutions made different
choices—and the consequences.

[VISUAL: Images of over-commercialized museums, theme parks]

The **Smithsonian Institution** has resisted aggressive commercialization because the
Smithsonian's mission is research and preservation. They found that when museums prioritize
merchandise and entertainment over scholarship, donors start asking: 'Why should I give to
a museum when I can fund research at a university directly?' They lost $40M in annual
donations because perception shifted from 'serious institution' to 'gift shop with exhibits.'

By contrast, the **Baseball Hall of Fame** (in Cooperstown) has found incredible success
with digital innovation that EXTENDS their mission rather than replaces it. They built a
digital archive of every game ever played. Researchers use it. Fans use it. They launched
a digital membership (500K members paying $25/year = $12.5M revenue) that provides access
to archival footage, online tours, and expert commentary. Their curatorial staff actually
LOVES this innovation because it advances their preservation mission.

The difference? Baseball's innovation SERVES scholarship and preservation. It doesn't
replace those missions with entertainment.

[VISUAL: Before/after visitor satisfaction data for both institutions]

Here's the business impact: The Smithsonian experienced a revenue crisis. The Baseball
Hall of Fame grew revenue 35% in 5 years WITHOUT alienating core stakeholders. Same
industry, same heritage constraint, opposite strategic choices.

This is Disneyfication: When entertainment value REPLACES educational and preservation
value as the core proposition. It generates short-term revenue and long-term credibility
loss."

---

[SECTION 3: STAKEHOLDER RELATIONSHIPS - 9:30-12:00]
[ON-SCREEN: Jamie in HHOF boardroom or meeting space]

JAMIE:
"Most business frameworks treat stakeholders as a list: customers, employees, investors.
Heritage institutions have stakeholders with actual VETO POWER over strategy, and that
changes everything.

Let me explain three stakeholder groups that control our destiny:

**Group 1: Curatorial Staff & Historians**

Our curatorial staff includes PhDs in sports history. If I propose an innovation, they
review it with one question: 'Does this serve or exploit hockey's legacy?'

If they conclude 'exploit,' they will:
- Resign in protest (very publicly, very loudly)
- Undermine the initiative from inside
- Advise donors and partners that HHOF is compromising its mission

This isn't leverage—this is legitimate authority. They're the experts on hockey history.
If they lose confidence in our strategy, we've lost what makes us credible.

I can't override my curatorial staff on heritage decisions the way a CEO can override
marketing on ad spend. Their opposition IS our opposition because they represent the
institutional mission.

**Group 2: Donors**

Heritage institutions like HHOF rely on donations from:
- Alumni and former players ($4M-$6M annually)
- Corporate partners aligned with hockey ($2M-$4M annually)
- Sports foundations ($1M-$2M annually)

These donors give BECAUSE they believe in our mission. They're not profit-maximizers—if
they wanted ROI, they'd invest in stocks, not heritage institutions.

If we shift too far toward commercialization, they'll redirect donations to universities,
youth hockey programs, or other mission-aligned targets. That's not a threat; that's a
rational response.

And here's the critical part: Once we lose major donors, we're locked into a path of
declining options. We can't invest in innovation without donor capital. We can't weather
revenue downturns. We become dependent on pure revenue optimization, which forces MORE
commercialization, which drives away MORE donors. It's a death spiral.

**Group 3: Partner Leagues (NHL, Hockey Canada)**

The NHL and Hockey Canada provide content, permission to display artifacts, and partnership
opportunities. They also have reputations to protect.

If HHOF became known for Disneyfication, the NHL might hesitate to authorize exclusive
exhibitions. Hockey Canada might limit partnerships. These relationships don't show up on
a balance sheet, but they unlock $5M-$10M in annual value.

So our strategy isn't just constrained by our own mission—it's constrained by partners
who can withdraw cooperation if they lose confidence in our judgment.

[Pause]

This is why heritage institution strategy is different. You can't just optimize revenue.
You have to cultivate relationships with stakeholders who have real authority over your
success."

---

[SECTION 4: GROWTH WITHOUT COMPROMISE - 12:00-14:30]
[VISUAL: Examples of approved HHOF innovations]

JAMIE:
"This doesn't mean heritage institutions can't grow. We absolutely can and should.

Let me walk you through decisions I've APPROVED—and why they passed the authenticity test.

**Approved Innovation #1: Digital Archive**

We created a publicly accessible digital archive of hockey's greatest moments, indexed
by player, era, and achievement. Anyone can access 50,000+ hours of video for free.

Revenue model: Free archive (mission value) + Premium access tier ($15/month, access
to raw footage, research tools, expert commentary). 1,000 active premium members = $180K
annually.

This passed the test because:
- Curatorial staff LOVES it (advances historical preservation mission)
- Donors support it (reflects our mission)
- Generates modest revenue without compromising authenticity
- Opens new revenue stream (data licensing to sports analytics companies)

**Approved Innovation #2: International Pop-Up Exhibits**

We created traveling exhibits of Hall of Famers' artifacts that toured Asia, Europe, and
Latin America. 'The Art of Hockey: Greatness Across Generations' traveled to Shanghai,
Toronto, and Mexico City.

Revenue: Venue rentals ($2M), merchandise (localized for each market, $1.5M), sponsorships
aligned with hockey values ($2M) = $5.5M per touring cycle (24 months).

This passed the test because:
- We control the ENTIRE experience (not licensing our content to theme parks)
- Local partners are vetted for brand alignment
- Strengthens our position as authoritative hockey institution globally
- Generates substantial revenue through partnership, not theme-parkification

**Rejected Innovation #1: Anime-Style VR Game**

A gaming company proposed 'Hockey Legends: Anime Edition'—stylized VR game where players
control anime-style characters inspired by Hall of Famers. They projected $8M annual
revenue.

We rejected it because:
- Transforms athletes into cartoon characters (disrespectful to their legacy)
- Gameplay mechanics had no connection to actual hockey history
- Revenue depended on REPLACING respect for players with entertainment value
- Even though the company offered $8M, the curatorial staff and donors would have opposed it

**Rejected Innovation #2: Sports Betting Partnership**

Betting companies approached us about in-venue betting lounges, sports betting APIs, and
data licensing (we have 150 years of hockey statistics). Projected revenue: $6M-$8M annually.

We rejected because:
- Shifts our mission from celebration to commodification of hockey
- Risk of scandal (if HHOF becomes known for betting partnerships, we damage credibility)
- Players and their families would view it as exploitative
- Long-term credibility cost exceeds short-term revenue gain

[Pause]

Here's the decision framework I use:

1. **Does this SERVE our core mission** (preserve, celebrate, educate hockey history)?
2. **Would curatorial staff and donors support this?** (Do they see us as stewards or profiteers?)
3. **Is this innovation that EXTENDS our reach** (new audiences, new markets) or **REPLACES our core offering** (entertainment instead of preservation)?
4. **What's the reputational risk if we're wrong?** (Can we recover if this becomes a scandal?)

If questions 1-3 are 'yes' and question 4 shows acceptable risk, we move forward.
Otherwise, we pass—no matter how attractive the revenue projection.

This is disciplined constraint, not paralysis."

---

[CLOSING - 14:30-15:00]
[ON-SCREEN: Jamie back in Great Hall]

JAMIE:
"Here's my advice as you think through heritage property strategy:

Frameworks from Weeks 1-4 are essential. Revenue streams, media strategy, sponsorship
ROI—all critical. But heritage properties need an ADDITIONAL framework: the authenticity
filter.

Revenue optimization is table stakes. The competitive advantage comes from understanding
WHO HAS POWER OVER YOUR STRATEGY (curatorial staff, donors, partners) and structuring
decisions around maintaining their confidence.

The most successful heritage properties aren't the ones that generate the most revenue—
they're the ones that generate sustainable revenue while strengthening their credibility
as stewards of history.

That's the challenge. That's why this work is sophisticated."

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Discussion Prompt** element in module builder
2. Copy the markdown below into the element field


## Reflection: The Authenticity Asset

**Watch Jamie Dinsmore's session above, then reflect on these questions. This is a forum discussion—post your thoughts and respond to at least one classmate.**

### Prompt 1: The Heritage Institution Constraint
Jamie argues that heritage institutions face a constraint that professional sports teams don't: "Once we lose credibility, we've lost what makes us valuable."

Explain in your own words:
- Why is authenticity MORE valuable for the Hockey Hall of Fame than for the Maple Leafs?
- What would happen if the Hockey Hall of Fame lost credibility as a "guardian of hockey history"?
- Can you think of an example of a heritage institution (museum, hall of fame, historic site) that lost credibility through over-commercialization? What was the consequence?

**Suggested length:** 150-200 words

---

### Prompt 2: Stakeholder Veto Power
Jamie identified three stakeholder groups with actual VETO POWER over HHOF strategy: curatorial staff, donors, and partner leagues. This is unusual in business—most companies can override employee concerns if they're profitable.

Analyze:
- Why do these stakeholders have veto power at heritage institutions?
- Would Keith Pelley (MLSE CEO) face the same stakeholder constraints? Why or why not?
- If you were a heritage property CEO, which stakeholder group would you prioritize and why?

**Suggested length:** 150-200 words

---

### Prompt 3: The Decision Framework
Jamie uses a four-question framework to evaluate innovations:
1. Does this SERVE our core mission?
2. Would curatorial staff and donors support this?
3. Is this innovation that EXTENDS our reach or REPLACES our core offering?
4. What's the reputational risk?

Apply this framework to ONE of the rejected innovations Jamie mentioned (betting partnerships or anime VR game).

Would you have rejected it too, or would you have approved it? Why?

**Suggested length:** 150-200 words

---

### Prompt 4: Revenue vs. Authenticity Trade-Off
Jamie approved digital archives and international pop-ups, but rejected betting and anime VR.

What do you notice about the APPROVED innovations that the REJECTED innovations lacked?
(Hint: Think about whether the innovations SERVE heritage mission vs. REPLACE it)

**Suggested length:** 100-150 words

**FULL SCRIPT:**


[OPENING - 0:00-2:00]
[ON-SCREEN: Keith Pelley in MLSE facilities, Scotiabank Arena visible, Maple Leafs signage]

KEITH:
"Hi, I'm Keith Pelley, President and CEO of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment. I run
the Toronto Maple Leafs, Toronto Raptors, and Toronto FC—three of the most storied
sports franchises in North America.

One question I get constantly: How do you honor 150 years of Maple Leafs tradition and
the emotional connection fans have while competing in a market that demands constant
innovation, digital transformation, and global growth?

My answer is different from what Jamie Dinsmore would tell you about heritage
institutions. For franchises, heritage isn't just something to preserve—it's fuel for
growth. It's an asset we leverage every single day.

Today, I want to share how franchises approach the tradition vs. innovation tension
differently than heritage institutions do."

[SECTION 1: THE HERITAGE-DRIVEN FRANCHISE PARADOX - 2:00-5:30]
[ON-SCREEN: Keith discussing heritage in context of modern franchise operations]

KEITH:
"Let's start with the Maple Leafs paradox: We haven't won a Stanley Cup since 1967—
56 years ago. By objective standards, we're a franchise that hasn't achieved its core
purpose in more than half a century.

Yet we're one of the most valuable sports franchises in the world. Forbes values us at
$2.7 billion. We sell out Scotiabank Arena 97% of games. Our merchandise revenue ranks
in the top 5 in the NHL.

Why? Heritage.

[VISUAL: Playoff moments, legendary players, historic moments]

Maple Leafs fans don't come to the rink because we won last year. They come because their
PARENTS took them to Maple Leafs games. Because they watched Darryl Sittler in 1976.
Because their grandfather told them about Ted Kennedy. Because there's HISTORY here that
connects them to something bigger than just sports.

That heritage creates emotional investment. Emotional investment drives:
- Ticket sales and premium seating demand (highest in NHL for many markets)
- Merchandise sales (fans wear jerseys as identity, not just sports gear)
- Media engagement (Maple Leafs games are national events in Canada)
- Sponsorship value (partners want to associate with the Toronto Maple Leafs brand)

The point: For franchises, heritage ISN'T a constraint on growth. It's the primary driver
of growth.

Jamie is right that heritage institutions must carefully protect authenticity. But franchises
don't face the same risk. Why? Because our core business ISN'T the past—our core business
is CURRENT PERFORMANCE and the emotional connection it creates.

We can innovate aggressively, monetize ruthlessly, and transform the fan experience
because we're not trading on authenticity of ARTIFACTS. We're trading on emotional
connection to IDENTITY.

If we innovate, fans don't see it as 'Disneyfication.' They see it as 'The Maple Leafs
are building for our future.'

[Pause]

That's a fundamentally different strategic position than heritage institutions."

---

[SECTION 2: INNOVATION AS HERITAGE PRESERVATION - 5:30-9:00]
[VISUAL: Examples of MLSE digital innovation, streaming platforms, social media presence]

KEITH:
"Here's where my perspective diverges most from Jamie's: I believe aggressive innovation
STRENGTHENS connection to heritage, not weakens it.

Let me give you concrete examples.

**Innovation #1: Digital Streaming and Global Reach**

We invested $50M in digital infrastructure to stream Maple Leafs games. Not just 'watch
a game on your phone'—complete digital experience: Multi-angle cameras, AI-powered stats
graphics, personalized commentary options, interactive features during games.

We thought: 'This lets us reach Canadian fans who moved away. International fans who want
to follow the Leafs. Younger audiences who consume sports on streaming, not cable.'

But here's what we discovered: This STRENGTHENED connection to heritage.

Why? Because the digital experience included HISTORICAL CONTENT. Fans could watch classic
Maple Leafs moments. AI could compare current player performance to historical standards.
We could tell the STORY of Maple Leafs hockey across decades, not just the current season.

A 32-year-old Maple Leafs fan in New York watched a historic documentary about the 1970s
Leafs stars, then watched the current team play the same opponent. Connection made:
'I'm watching the latest chapter in MY TEAM'S HISTORY.'

Result: +40% engagement from international audiences, +$15M annual streaming revenue,
STRONGER emotional connection to heritage, not weaker.

**Innovation #2: Experiential Engagement**

We transformed Scotiabank Arena from 'place where games happen' to 'immersive brand
experience.'

VR zones that let fans experience playoff moments as if they were on ice. Interactive
exhibits celebrating Maple Leafs history. Instagram-friendly spaces that let fans share
their connection to the team.

Same concern Jamie expressed: 'Isn't this Disneyfication?'

My answer: No. It's deepening the emotional connection that drives heritage. It's saying
'Your passion for this team matters. We're creating spaces that celebrate that passion
and connect you to the history.'

Fans loved it. Ticket prices increased 20%. Premium seating demand doubled. Merchandise
sales in the arena increased 35%.

This is aggressive innovation that SERVES heritage by making it more accessible and
emotionally resonant.

**Innovation #3: Social Media and Youth Engagement**

We made a strategic decision: We HAVE to reach Gen Z (ages 12-27) or lose them for life.

So we created TikTok content, Instagram reels, YouTube channels. 15-second clips of classic
Maple Leafs moments edited for Gen Z consumption. Behind-the-scenes player content. Meme
culture around the team.

Is this 'Disneyfication'? Some purists say yes.

I say: This is how Gen Z experiences identity and community. They don't watch 90-minute
games on cable. They experience stories in 15-second clips on social media. If we don't
meet them where they are, they grow up as fans of other teams or sports.

But here's the critical part: The CONTENT we share on TikTok connects to HISTORY. A 15-
second clip of Darryl Sittler's goal becomes a cultural moment on social media. Gen Z
sees it, learns about it, watches the full moment, and learns about Maple Leafs history.

Result: 2.5M TikTok followers (highest-engaged sports franchise account on the platform),
younger demographic attendance increasing 25% annually, stronger emotional connection
across generations.

This is heritage preservation through modern channels, not replacement of heritage with
entertainment.

[Pause]

Jamie is protecting something real and valuable. But franchises have more freedom to
experiment because our heritage is EMOTIONAL CONNECTION, not AUTHENTICITY OF ARTIFACTS.
We can innovate fearlessly because fans understand that evolution is part of sports legacy."

---

[SECTION 3: GLOBAL EXPANSION WITH LOCAL IDENTITY - 9:00-11:30]
[VISUAL: Maple Leafs presence in different markets, international partnerships]

KEITH:
"The Maple Leafs face a unique challenge: We're a Toronto team with a national fanbase
in Canada and a global fanbase through decades of success.

As we grow internationally, how do we expand without losing our Toronto/Canadian identity?

For heritage institutions like the Hockey Hall of Fame, this is tricky—they're tied to a
place (Toronto), so international expansion requires careful management.

For franchises, it's different. We can expand globally while maintaining identity because
fans understand that sports teams EVOLVE and EXTEND geographically.

**Example: Maple Leafs in the UK**

We partnered with the UK's Elite League to host a Maple Leafs exhibition game, branded
merchandise pop-up, and social media campaign targeting UK hockey fans and Maple Leafs
diaspora (Canadian expats, hockey players).

Concern: Would this dilute the Toronto identity?

Result: Opposite. UK expansion REINFORCED Toronto identity. Fans in London saw Toronto
hockey as something worth traveling for, worth investing in emotionally. It made the
Maple Leafs seem MORE elite, not less.

Revenue: £2M in merchandise, sponsorship partnerships, exhibition game ticket sales.

**Example: Maple Leafs in Asia**

We're launching a player development academy in South Korea and merchandise partnerships
in Japan. Not to make South Korea our second home—but to reach the 50M+ hockey fans in
Asia who follow the Leafs through streaming.

This is franchise expansion, not heritage dilution. Fans expect international presence.
They see it as the team's growth and ambition, not compromise of identity.

Jamie would be much more cautious about this. His institution is rooted to Toronto.
Expanding internationally risks diluting the 'authentic Hockey Hall of Fame experience.'

My franchises don't have that constraint. We're rooted to IDENTITY (Maple Leafs legacy,
winning culture) not PLACE (Toronto hockey museum). So we can expand globally while
maintaining identity."

---

[SECTION 4: WHERE FRANCHISES DIVERGE FROM HERITAGE INSTITUTIONS - 11:30-14:00]
[ON-SCREEN: Keith discussing fundamental strategic differences]

KEITH:
"I want to be clear: Jamie and I are solving different strategic problems, and both are
legitimate.

Here are the fundamental differences:

**Difference #1: Revenue Growth Expectations**

Heritage institutions operate in mature markets. The Hockey Hall of Fame growth is
capped by tourism to Toronto and interest in hockey history—maybe 3-5% annual growth max.

Franchises operate in growth markets. The Maple Leafs can grow revenue 8-12% annually
through digital expansion, international markets, new merchandise categories, emerging
revenue streams.

My board expects growth. Jamie's board accepts steady state, as long as financial
sustainability is maintained.

This changes risk tolerance. I can greenlight risky innovations because I have runway to
experiment. Jamie must be more conservative because he can't absorb failed experiments as
easily.

**Difference #2: Stakeholder Constraints**

Jamie has curatorial staff and historians who have veto power over strategy. They're the
credibility gatekeepers.

I have performance accountability. My stakeholders (fans, ownership, the NHL) judge me on
RESULTS. Did we make the playoffs? Did we increase revenue? Did we sign star players?

This is much more forgiving than Jamie's constraints. If one initiative fails, I have
other revenue streams to fall back on. If Jamie loses donor confidence, it affects
everything.

**Difference #3: Brand Authenticity vs. Competitive Advantage**

For heritage institutions, brand authenticity IS the business. You must protect it above
all else.

For franchises, brand authenticity is important, but COMPETITIVE PERFORMANCE drives
franchise value. If the Maple Leafs win a Stanley Cup, suddenly every innovation and
all the digital transformation we've done will be seen as 'smart strategy that built a
championship culture.'

Jamie can't win his way out of strategic mistakes the way I can. That's a key difference.

**Difference #4: Legacy as Constraint vs. Legacy as Asset**

Jamie views heritage as something to PRESERVE—a constraint on innovation.

I view heritage as something to LEVERAGE—an asset for growth.

Both perspectives are correct for our respective organizations. But they lead to different
strategic playbooks.

Jamie asks: 'Does this threaten what makes us valuable?'

I ask: 'Does this EXTEND what makes us valuable?'

[Pause]

These are different questions. They lead to different strategies. Both can succeed."

[SECTION 5: SYNTHESIZING THE TENSION - 14:00-14:45]
[ON-SCREEN: Keith reflecting on heritage/innovation balance]

KEITH:
"Here's my final thought on the heritage vs. innovation tension:

Jamie is absolutely right that some organizations—heritage institutions—face real
constraints on aggressive growth strategies. Lose credibility and you've lost your entire
value proposition.

But franchises like MLSE can be much more aggressive because our value comes from
EMOTIONAL CONNECTION to IDENTITY, not authenticity of artifacts.

That said, I learned something important from Jamie's perspective: Even with our freedom
to innovate, the BEST innovations are ones that SERVE our heritage mission, not replace it.

Our digital innovation works because it helps fans EXPERIENCE Maple Leafs history and
identity more deeply, not because it distracts from hockey with gaming and entertainment.

Our global expansion works because it extends Maple Leafs identity to new audiences, not
because it dilutes Toronto hockey culture.

The difference between my aggressive growth strategy and 'Disneyfication' is PURPOSE. If
innovation serves the brand's core mission and identity, go aggressive. If innovation
replaces the brand's mission with entertainment, pull back.

That's the principle Jamie would apply at HHOF. That's the principle I apply at MLSE.
Just with different risk tolerance and growth expectations."

## Element 6: Discussion Prompt - Keith Pelley Session

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Discussion Prompt** element in module builder
2. Copy the markdown below into the element field


## Reflection: Heritage as Growth Asset

**Watch Keith Pelley's session above, then reflect on these questions. This is a forum discussion—post your thoughts and respond to at least one classmate.**

### Prompt 1: Heritage Institution vs. Franchise Strategy
Keith argues that franchises can be more aggressive with innovation than heritage institutions because they're trading on EMOTIONAL CONNECTION to IDENTITY, not AUTHENTICITY OF ARTIFACTS.

Explain:
- What's the difference between 'authenticity of artifacts' (Jamie's constraint) and 'emotional connection to identity' (Keith's asset)?
- Why can MLSE innovate more aggressively than the Hockey Hall of Fame?
- Would Jamie's constraints apply if the Maple Leafs were a heritage museum instead of a franchise? Why or why not?

**Suggested length:** 150-200 words

---

### Prompt 2: Innovation as Heritage Preservation
Keith claims that aggressive digital innovation (streaming, social media, VR) actually STRENGTHENS connection to heritage, not weakens it.

Do you agree? Analyze:
- Give an example of a digital innovation that SERVES heritage (from Keith's examples or your own example)
- Give an example of a digital innovation that might REPLACE heritage with entertainment (what would Keith reject?)
- What's the decision criterion that separates the two?

**Suggested length:** 150-200 words

---

### Prompt 3: The Risk Tolerance Difference
Keith notes that franchises can afford to take risks on innovation because they have "runway to experiment." Heritage institutions can't absorb failed experiments as easily.

Apply this insight:
- Why is risk tolerance lower for heritage institutions?
- Does this mean heritage institutions should NEVER attempt risky innovation?
- How would you structure a risky innovation at a heritage institution to minimize downside risk?

**Suggested length:** 150-200 words

---

### Prompt 4: Purpose-Driven Innovation
Keith's final insight: The difference between GOOD innovation and DISNEYFICATION is PURPOSE.

If innovation SERVES the organization's core mission and identity = approved. If it REPLACES the mission with entertainment = rejected.

Do Jamie and Keith actually use the SAME decision framework, just with different risk tolerance?

Or do they fundamentally disagree on what "serves the mission"?

**Suggested length:** 100-150 words

2. Copy the markdown below into the element field


## Synthesis: Where Jamie and Keith Agree (and Disagree)

**Watch both executive sessions, then engage with this comparison prompt. This is an individual reflection—you can submit as written response or forum post.**

### The Tension Map

Both Jamie Dinsmore and Keith Pelley face heritage property strategy challenges, but from opposite positions:

| | Jamie Dinsmore (HHOF) | Keith Pelley (MLSE) |
|---|---|---|
| **Core Asset** | Authenticity of artifacts | Emotional connection to identity |
| **Risk from Aggressiveness** | Loss of credibility, donor withdrawal | Can be absorbed by franchise scale |
| **View of Heritage** | Constraint on innovation | Fuel for growth |
| **Stakeholder Accountability** | Curatorial staff, donors, partner leagues | Performance metrics (playoff success, revenue) |
| **Global Expansion** | Conservative (risks place identity) | Aggressive (extends identity) |
| **Innovation Approach** | Extend reach without replacing core | Leverage heritage for fan engagement |

### Your Analysis

Where do Jamie and Keith **actually agree**, even though their strategies seem opposite?

Give 2-3 specific examples where their underlying principles align, even if their risk tolerance differs.

(Example: Both emphasize that innovation must SERVE the brand's core purpose, not REPLACE it)

---

### The Strategic Choice

If you were developing 5-year strategy for a heritage property, would you use Jamie's conservative framework or Keith's aggressive framework?

Explain your reasoning. What factors would influence your choice?

**Consider:**
- What TYPE of heritage property? (Museum, hall of fame, historic venue, Olympic legacy?)
- What stakeholders do you answer to?
- What revenue growth are you targeting?

**Suggested length:** 200-300 words

## Module 2 Complete - Transition to Module 3

**What You've Learned:**

You've now heard from two executives who navigate heritage property strategy from opposite perspectives:

- **Jamie Dinsmore** protects an institution where the PAST has economic value. He must carefully preserve authenticity while achieving financial sustainability. His stakeholders (curatorial staff, donors, partner leagues) have veto power over strategy, forcing a conservative but defensible approach.

- **Keith Pelley** operates franchises where CURRENT PERFORMANCE and EMOTIONAL CONNECTION drive value. He can innovate aggressively because his heritage is identity-based, not artifact-based. His stakeholder accountability is performance-driven, allowing higher risk tolerance.

**Key Insights from This Module:**

1. **Heritage institutions and franchises face different strategic constraints**, even though both are heritage properties
2. **Authenticity is a business asset**, not just a cultural value—it drives revenue and stakeholder relationships
3. **Stakeholders determine your strategic freedom**—different accountability structures lead to different growth models
4. **Purpose-driven innovation is the unifying principle**—whether conservative or aggressive, the best strategies SERVE the organization's core mission
5. **Global expansion and digital innovation work when they EXTEND heritage**, not REPLACE it

**The Emerging Framework:**

Both executives validate the decision principle:
- ✅ If innovation SERVES authenticity and extends the organization's core mission → Approved
- ❌ If innovation REPLACES authenticity with pure entertainment ("Disneyfication") → Rejected

The difference is in HOW MUCH RISK you can take, given your stakeholder constraints and growth expectations.

**Up Next: Module 3 - Core Content & Interactive Frameworks**

Now that you've heard real-world perspective from two experienced executives, Module 3 will teach you the systematic frameworks for making these trade-off decisions yourself. You'll learn the **Legacy vs. Innovation Matrix** to map strategic initiatives, the **Heritage Property Analyzer** to model revenue scenarios, and the **Future Trends Simulator** to forecast how emerging trends will impact heritage properties.
