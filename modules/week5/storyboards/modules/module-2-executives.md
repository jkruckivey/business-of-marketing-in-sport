## Element 1: From Learning to Listening: Heritage Perspectives

**Title:** From Challenge to Expert Perspective

**Copy this markdown directly into Uplimit:**

## From Challenge to Expert Perspective

You've been introduced to the heritage monetization dilemma—the challenge every heritage sports property faces: How do you honor the past while competing in a growth-obsessed present?

**Connecting to Weeks 1-4:** As you listen to this week's executives, notice how they apply frameworks you've already learned:
- **Week 1 (Kevin Abrams):** Revenue ecosystems—how different streams interconnect in a $10B organization
- **Week 2 (Al Dak):** Media rights strategy, streaming vs. broadcast, fan engagement data
- **Week 3 (Andrew Sneyd):** Brand building, innovation, measuring what matters
- **Week 4 (Matt Rubinoff + Golf Canada):** Emerging sports, proof-of-concept, balancing growth with brand identity, NSO marketing

Now it's time to hear from three executives who live these tensions every day. In this module, you'll encounter a unique learning experience: a three-way dialogue between perspectives on what makes heritage properties valuable, how to grow them without losing their soul, and how to lead a league into the future.

First, you'll hear from **Jamie Dinsmore, President & CEO of the Hockey Hall of Fame**—the guardian institution charged with preserving hockey's history and celebrating its greatest players. Then, you'll hear from **Keith Pelley, President and CEO of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE)**—a modern sports franchise operator who owns both the Maple Leafs and Raptors and understands the business of growth and fan engagement. Finally, you'll hear from **Stewart Johnston, Commissioner of the Canadian Football League**—leading a heritage league through transformation while planning for expansion.

All three leaders face heritage property challenges, but from different angles:
- **Jamie** manages an institution where preservation IS the business (the past has economic value)
- **Keith** manages franchises where the future drives value (current performance and innovation create revenue)
- **Stewart** manages a 100+ year league balancing passionate traditionalist fans with growth imperatives and expansion opportunities

Their insights will reveal the real trade-offs, the constraints that frameworks can't capture, and the human dimensions of heritage strategy that come from decades of executive decision-making.

**Capstone Connection:** Listen carefully for where they agree (all prioritize authenticity), where they diverge (on how much innovation is too much), and how Stewart's league expansion perspective directly connects to your CFL expansion project.

## Element 3: Video 1 - Jamie Dinsmore (Hockey Hall of Fame CEO) ✅ AVAILABLE

**File:** `Interviews/Jamie Dinsmore - President & CEO, Hockey Hall of Fame.mp4`
**Duration:** ~18 minutes
**Transcript:** `Interviews/Jamie Dinsmore - President & CEO, Hockey Hall of Fame.txt`
**Video Title:** "Jamie Dinsmore: Leading the Hockey Hall of Fame"
**Video Caption:** "Hockey Hall of Fame President & CEO shares insights on heritage institution management, four lines of business, and AR/VR vision for the future"

### Interview Content - Key Topics Covered:

**Career Journey & Background (00:00-04:00)** - Competitive nature from age 10, played every sport imaginable. Business career background before taking on HHOF role. "There's only one Hockey Hall of Fame"—role comes up once every few decades (previous CEO Jeff Denham served 27 years). Started July 1st, 2024.

**Mission & Business Model (04:00-08:00)** - Mission: "Honoring the legends, igniting fandom, expanding the game globally." Registered charity/not-for-profit status. Four lines of business:
- **Attraction (museum)**: ~$8.5M revenue
- **Events**: Corporate and personal events using the Hall after hours, ~$5M revenue
- **Retail**: Spirit of Hockey store, NHL merchandise, pucks, apparel
- **Outreach**: Cup movements, educational programs, bringing the Hall to communities

**Staff Passion & Culture (05:00-07:00)** - "People have been at the hall for a very long time." More staff at 20+ years than under 20 years. **42% have been here 25 years or more.** Deep passion for hockey and the institution.

**The Stanley Cup (13:00-15:00)** - "There's no trophy in all of sports that comes anywhere close to the Stanley Cup... it's the people's trophy. It's not just sitting in a museum behind glass." Visitors can touch it. Every winning player gets a trophy day. Stories connect generations.

**Growth Strategy (11:00-14:00)** - Physical expansion at Toronto location. International exhibits (Edmonton Oilers mini Hall of Fame at Rogers Place as model—could expand to 31+ NHL franchises). What can we do in Europe, Asia, south of the border? Women's hockey transformation. Diversity and inclusion stories.

**Technology Vision (22:00-26:00)** - "Low tech can be just as exciting as high tech"—storytelling is key. But AR/VR is exciting: "I think we're on the precipice of something really cool." Imagine experiencing Connor McDavid's speed virtually, or being the defenseman facing Marie-Philip Poulin's wrist shot. "Until you're in the game, at least virtually, you don't truly understand the speed and skill."

**Heritage Preservation Approach (27:00-29:00)** - Three principles:
1. Don't tarnish the brand
2. Operate professionally with everyone (internal, external, guests)
3. Be fiscally responsible

"Don't lose core and then look to grow... We're not throwing the baby out with the bathwater."

**Revenue & Growth Opportunities (14:00-16:00)** - Partnerships and sponsorships are key growth area. Elite stats: Less than 0.015% of sports players become professional. Less than 800 NHL skaters at any time. Only ~2% of eligible men make the Hall of Fame. "It's the elite of the elite."

**10-Year Vision (30:00-33:00)** - "I don't plan on doing anything but what I'm doing... you'll have to take me out in a time box." Primary innovation goal: AR/VR experiences that give people a different lens on the game—the "great equalizer" concept.

### Viewing Guide for Students:
- **Heritage Institution Business Model**: Four distinct revenue lines (attraction, events, retail, outreach) in a not-for-profit structure
- **Staff Culture as Asset**: 42% at 25+ years tenure—what does this mean for institutional knowledge and heritage preservation?
- **The Stanley Cup Strategy**: "People's trophy" approach—touchable, travels, creates generational stories
- **Technology as Enhancement**: AR/VR to help people "truly understand the speed and skill"—serving the mission, not replacing it
- **Heritage Preservation Principle**: "Don't lose core and then look to grow"

### Connection to Week 5 Themes:
- **WLO 5.1 (Heritage Properties as Revenue Assets)**: Four lines of business, $8.5M attraction + $5M events revenue
- **WLO 5.2 (Balancing Tradition with Innovation)**: "Don't lose core, then look to grow" + AR/VR vision
- **WLO 5.3 (Future Trends)**: AR/VR, international expansion, women's hockey growth

**Key Quotes:**
> "There's only one Hockey Hall of Fame... it only comes up once every few decades."

> "42% have been here 25 years or more."

> "There's no trophy in all of sports that comes anywhere close to the Stanley Cup... it's the people's trophy."

> "I think we're on the precipice of something really cool" (on AR/VR)

2. Copy the markdown below into the element field

```markdown
## Reflection: Heritage Institution Management

**Watch Jamie Dinsmore's session above, then reflect on these questions. Post your thoughts and respond to at least one classmate.**

### Prompt 1: Four Lines of Business
Jamie describes the Hockey Hall of Fame's four revenue streams: Attraction ($8.5M), Events ($5M), Retail, and Outreach. This is very different from a professional sports franchise.

Analyze:
- How does this business model compare to the revenue streams you learned in Week 1?
- Why might heritage institutions have more diverse revenue sources than franchises?
- Which line of business do you think has the most growth potential? Why?

**Suggested length:** 150-200 words

---

### Prompt 2: Staff Tenure as Competitive Advantage
Jamie reveals that 42% of staff have been at the Hall for 25+ years. This is remarkable institutional knowledge.

Consider:
- How does long staff tenure affect heritage preservation?
- What are the risks of such high tenure (potential blind spots, resistance to change)?
- How would you balance institutional knowledge with fresh perspectives?

**Suggested length:** 150-200 words

---

### Prompt 3: The Stanley Cup as "People's Trophy"
Jamie calls the Stanley Cup "the people's trophy"—it's touchable, travels with winners, and creates generational stories. This is a deliberate heritage strategy.

Apply to Week 5 themes:
- How does this approach differ from keeping artifacts "behind glass"?
- What are the business implications of making heritage accessible vs. exclusive?
- Can you think of other heritage properties that use a similar "people's" approach?

**Suggested length:** 150-200 words

---

### Prompt 4: AR/VR Vision - Enhancement vs. Replacement
Jamie is excited about AR/VR but emphasizes "low tech can be just as exciting as high tech"—storytelling is key. His vision: help people "truly understand the speed and skill" through virtual experiences.

Critical analysis:
- Does Jamie's AR/VR vision SERVE the Hall's heritage mission or REPLACE it?
- How does this compare to Keith's technology approach (next video)?
- What would make AR/VR at the Hall "Disneyfication" vs. "enhancement"?

**Suggested length:** 100-150 words

**FULL SCRIPT:**


[OPENING - 0:00-2:00]
[ON-SCREEN: Keith Pelley in MLSE facilities, Scotiabank Arena visible, Maple Leafs signage]

KEITH:
"Hi, I'm Keith Pelley, President and CEO of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment. I run
the Toronto Maple Leafs, Toronto Raptors, and Toronto FC—three of the most storied
sports franchises in North America.

One question I get constantly: How do you honor 150 years of Maple Leafs tradition and
the emotional connection fans have while competing in a market that demands constant
innovation, digital transformation, and global growth?

My answer is different from what Jamie Dinsmore would tell you about heritage
institutions. For franchises, heritage isn't just something to preserve—it's fuel for
growth. It's an asset we leverage every single day.

Today, I want to share how franchises approach the tradition vs. innovation tension
differently than heritage institutions do."

[SECTION 1: THE HERITAGE-DRIVEN FRANCHISE PARADOX - 2:00-5:30]
[ON-SCREEN: Keith discussing heritage in context of modern franchise operations]

KEITH:
"Let's start with the Maple Leafs paradox: We haven't won a Stanley Cup since 1967—
56 years ago. By objective standards, we're a franchise that hasn't achieved its core
purpose in more than half a century.

Yet we're one of the most valuable sports franchises in the world. Forbes values us at
$2.7 billion. We sell out Scotiabank Arena 97% of games. Our merchandise revenue ranks
in the top 5 in the NHL.

Why? Heritage.

[VISUAL: Playoff moments, legendary players, historic moments]

Maple Leafs fans don't come to the rink because we won last year. They come because their
PARENTS took them to Maple Leafs games. Because they watched Darryl Sittler in 1976.
Because their grandfather told them about Ted Kennedy. Because there's HISTORY here that
connects them to something bigger than just sports.

That heritage creates emotional investment. Emotional investment drives:
- Ticket sales and premium seating demand (highest in NHL for many markets)
- Merchandise sales (fans wear jerseys as identity, not just sports gear)
- Media engagement (Maple Leafs games are national events in Canada)
- Sponsorship value (partners want to associate with the Toronto Maple Leafs brand)

The point: For franchises, heritage ISN'T a constraint on growth. It's the primary driver
of growth.

Jamie is right that heritage institutions must carefully protect authenticity. But franchises
don't face the same risk. Why? Because our core business ISN'T the past—our core business
is CURRENT PERFORMANCE and the emotional connection it creates.

We can innovate aggressively, monetize ruthlessly, and transform the fan experience
because we're not trading on authenticity of ARTIFACTS. We're trading on emotional
connection to IDENTITY.

If we innovate, fans don't see it as 'Disneyfication.' They see it as 'The Maple Leafs
are building for our future.'

[Pause]

That's a fundamentally different strategic position than heritage institutions."

---

[SECTION 2: INNOVATION AS HERITAGE PRESERVATION - 5:30-9:00]
[VISUAL: Examples of MLSE digital innovation, streaming platforms, social media presence]

KEITH:
"Here's where my perspective diverges most from Jamie's: I believe aggressive innovation
STRENGTHENS connection to heritage, not weakens it.

Let me give you concrete examples.

**Innovation #1: Digital Streaming and Global Reach**

We invested $50M in digital infrastructure to stream Maple Leafs games. Not just 'watch
a game on your phone'—complete digital experience: Multi-angle cameras, AI-powered stats
graphics, personalized commentary options, interactive features during games.

We thought: 'This lets us reach Canadian fans who moved away. International fans who want
to follow the Leafs. Younger audiences who consume sports on streaming, not cable.'

But here's what we discovered: This STRENGTHENED connection to heritage.

Why? Because the digital experience included HISTORICAL CONTENT. Fans could watch classic
Maple Leafs moments. AI could compare current player performance to historical standards.
We could tell the STORY of Maple Leafs hockey across decades, not just the current season.

A 32-year-old Maple Leafs fan in New York watched a historic documentary about the 1970s
Leafs stars, then watched the current team play the same opponent. Connection made:
'I'm watching the latest chapter in MY TEAM'S HISTORY.'

Result: +40% engagement from international audiences, +$15M annual streaming revenue,
STRONGER emotional connection to heritage, not weaker.

**Innovation #2: Experiential Engagement**

We transformed Scotiabank Arena from 'place where games happen' to 'immersive brand
experience.'

VR zones that let fans experience playoff moments as if they were on ice. Interactive
exhibits celebrating Maple Leafs history. Instagram-friendly spaces that let fans share
their connection to the team.

Same concern Jamie expressed: 'Isn't this Disneyfication?'

My answer: No. It's deepening the emotional connection that drives heritage. It's saying
'Your passion for this team matters. We're creating spaces that celebrate that passion
and connect you to the history.'

Fans loved it. Ticket prices increased 20%. Premium seating demand doubled. Merchandise
sales in the arena increased 35%.

This is aggressive innovation that SERVES heritage by making it more accessible and
emotionally resonant.

**Innovation #3: Social Media and Youth Engagement**

We made a strategic decision: We HAVE to reach Gen Z (ages 12-27) or lose them for life.

So we created TikTok content, Instagram reels, YouTube channels. 15-second clips of classic
Maple Leafs moments edited for Gen Z consumption. Behind-the-scenes player content. Meme
culture around the team.

Is this 'Disneyfication'? Some purists say yes.

I say: This is how Gen Z experiences identity and community. They don't watch 90-minute
games on cable. They experience stories in 15-second clips on social media. If we don't
meet them where they are, they grow up as fans of other teams or sports.

But here's the critical part: The CONTENT we share on TikTok connects to HISTORY. A 15-
second clip of Darryl Sittler's goal becomes a cultural moment on social media. Gen Z
sees it, learns about it, watches the full moment, and learns about Maple Leafs history.

Result: 2.5M TikTok followers (highest-engaged sports franchise account on the platform),
younger demographic attendance increasing 25% annually, stronger emotional connection
across generations.

This is heritage preservation through modern channels, not replacement of heritage with
entertainment.

[Pause]

Jamie is protecting something real and valuable. But franchises have more freedom to
experiment because our heritage is EMOTIONAL CONNECTION, not AUTHENTICITY OF ARTIFACTS.
We can innovate fearlessly because fans understand that evolution is part of sports legacy."

---

[SECTION 3: GLOBAL EXPANSION WITH LOCAL IDENTITY - 9:00-11:30]
[VISUAL: Maple Leafs presence in different markets, international partnerships]

KEITH:
"The Maple Leafs face a unique challenge: We're a Toronto team with a national fanbase
in Canada and a global fanbase through decades of success.

As we grow internationally, how do we expand without losing our Toronto/Canadian identity?

For heritage institutions like the Hockey Hall of Fame, this is tricky—they're tied to a
place (Toronto), so international expansion requires careful management.

For franchises, it's different. We can expand globally while maintaining identity because
fans understand that sports teams EVOLVE and EXTEND geographically.

**Example: Maple Leafs in the UK**

We partnered with the UK's Elite League to host a Maple Leafs exhibition game, branded
merchandise pop-up, and social media campaign targeting UK hockey fans and Maple Leafs
diaspora (Canadian expats, hockey players).

Concern: Would this dilute the Toronto identity?

Result: Opposite. UK expansion REINFORCED Toronto identity. Fans in London saw Toronto
hockey as something worth traveling for, worth investing in emotionally. It made the
Maple Leafs seem MORE elite, not less.

Revenue: £2M in merchandise, sponsorship partnerships, exhibition game ticket sales.

**Example: Maple Leafs in Asia**

We're launching a player development academy in South Korea and merchandise partnerships
in Japan. Not to make South Korea our second home—but to reach the 50M+ hockey fans in
Asia who follow the Leafs through streaming.

This is franchise expansion, not heritage dilution. Fans expect international presence.
They see it as the team's growth and ambition, not compromise of identity.

Jamie would be much more cautious about this. His institution is rooted to Toronto.
Expanding internationally risks diluting the 'authentic Hockey Hall of Fame experience.'

My franchises don't have that constraint. We're rooted to IDENTITY (Maple Leafs legacy,
winning culture) not PLACE (Toronto hockey museum). So we can expand globally while
maintaining identity."

---

[SECTION 4: WHERE FRANCHISES DIVERGE FROM HERITAGE INSTITUTIONS - 11:30-14:00]
[ON-SCREEN: Keith discussing fundamental strategic differences]

KEITH:
"I want to be clear: Jamie and I are solving different strategic problems, and both are
legitimate.

Here are the fundamental differences:

**Difference #1: Revenue Growth Expectations**

Heritage institutions operate in mature markets. The Hockey Hall of Fame growth is
capped by tourism to Toronto and interest in hockey history—maybe 3-5% annual growth max.

Franchises operate in growth markets. The Maple Leafs can grow revenue 8-12% annually
through digital expansion, international markets, new merchandise categories, emerging
revenue streams.

My board expects growth. Jamie's board accepts steady state, as long as financial
sustainability is maintained.

This changes risk tolerance. I can greenlight risky innovations because I have runway to
experiment. Jamie must be more conservative because he can't absorb failed experiments as
easily.

**Difference #2: Stakeholder Constraints**

Jamie has curatorial staff and historians who have veto power over strategy. They're the
credibility gatekeepers.

I have performance accountability. My stakeholders (fans, ownership, the NHL) judge me on
RESULTS. Did we make the playoffs? Did we increase revenue? Did we sign star players?

This is much more forgiving than Jamie's constraints. If one initiative fails, I have
other revenue streams to fall back on. If Jamie loses donor confidence, it affects
everything.

**Difference #3: Brand Authenticity vs. Competitive Advantage**

For heritage institutions, brand authenticity IS the business. You must protect it above
all else.

For franchises, brand authenticity is important, but COMPETITIVE PERFORMANCE drives
franchise value. If the Maple Leafs win a Stanley Cup, suddenly every innovation and
all the digital transformation we've done will be seen as 'smart strategy that built a
championship culture.'

Jamie can't win his way out of strategic mistakes the way I can. That's a key difference.

**Difference #4: Legacy as Constraint vs. Legacy as Asset**

Jamie views heritage as something to PRESERVE—a constraint on innovation.

I view heritage as something to LEVERAGE—an asset for growth.

Both perspectives are correct for our respective organizations. But they lead to different
strategic playbooks.

Jamie asks: 'Does this threaten what makes us valuable?'

I ask: 'Does this EXTEND what makes us valuable?'

[Pause]

These are different questions. They lead to different strategies. Both can succeed."

---

[SECTION 5: SYNTHESIZING THE TENSION - 14:00-14:45]
[ON-SCREEN: Keith reflecting on heritage/innovation balance]

KEITH:
"Here's my final thought on the heritage vs. innovation tension:

Jamie is absolutely right that some organizations—heritage institutions—face real
constraints on aggressive growth strategies. Lose credibility and you've lost your entire
value proposition.

But franchises like MLSE can be much more aggressive because our value comes from
EMOTIONAL CONNECTION to IDENTITY, not authenticity of artifacts.

That said, I learned something important from Jamie's perspective: Even with our freedom
to innovate, the BEST innovations are ones that SERVE our heritage mission, not replace it.

Our digital innovation works because it helps fans EXPERIENCE Maple Leafs history and
identity more deeply, not because it distracts from hockey with gaming and entertainment.

Our global expansion works because it extends Maple Leafs identity to new audiences, not
because it dilutes Toronto hockey culture.

The difference between my aggressive growth strategy and 'Disneyfication' is PURPOSE. If
innovation serves the brand's core mission and identity, go aggressive. If innovation
replaces the brand's mission with entertainment, pull back.

That's the principle Jamie would apply at HHOF. That's the principle I apply at MLSE.
Just with different risk tolerance and growth expectations."

2. Copy the markdown below into the element field


## Reflection: Heritage as Growth Asset

**Watch Keith Pelley's session above, then reflect on these questions. This is a forum discussion—post your thoughts and respond to at least one classmate.**

### Prompt 1: Heritage Institution vs. Franchise Strategy
Keith argues that franchises can be more aggressive with innovation than heritage institutions because they're trading on EMOTIONAL CONNECTION to IDENTITY, not AUTHENTICITY OF ARTIFACTS.

Explain:
- What's the difference between 'authenticity of artifacts' (Jamie's constraint) and 'emotional connection to identity' (Keith's asset)?
- Why can MLSE innovate more aggressively than the Hockey Hall of Fame?
- Would Jamie's constraints apply if the Maple Leafs were a heritage museum instead of a franchise? Why or why not?

**Suggested length:** 150-200 words

---

### Prompt 2: Innovation as Heritage Preservation
Keith claims that aggressive digital innovation (streaming, social media, VR) actually STRENGTHENS connection to heritage, not weakens it.

Do you agree? Analyze:
- Give an example of a digital innovation that SERVES heritage (from Keith's examples or your own example)
- Give an example of a digital innovation that might REPLACE heritage with entertainment (what would Keith reject?)
- What's the decision criterion that separates the two?

**Suggested length:** 150-200 words

---

### Prompt 3: The Risk Tolerance Difference
Keith notes that franchises can afford to take risks on innovation because they have "runway to experiment." Heritage institutions can't absorb failed experiments as easily.

Apply this insight:
- Why is risk tolerance lower for heritage institutions?
- Does this mean heritage institutions should NEVER attempt risky innovation?
- How would you structure a risky innovation at a heritage institution to minimize downside risk?

**Suggested length:** 150-200 words

### Prompt 4: Purpose-Driven Innovation
Keith's final insight: The difference between GOOD innovation and DISNEYFICATION is PURPOSE.

If innovation SERVES the organization's core mission and identity = approved. If it REPLACES the mission with entertainment = rejected.

Do Jamie and Keith actually use the SAME decision framework, just with different risk tolerance?

Or do they fundamentally disagree on what "serves the mission"?

## Element 7: Video 3 - Stewart Johnston (CFL Commissioner) ✅ AVAILABLE ⭐ CAPSTONE

**File:** `Interviews/Stewart Johnston - Commissioner, Canadian Football League.mp4`
**Duration:** ~35 minutes
**Transcript:** `Interviews/Stewart Johnston - Commissioner, Canadian Football League.txt`
**Video Title:** "Stewart Johnston: Leading the CFL into the Future - Tradition, Growth & Expansion"
**Video Caption:** "CFL Commissioner Stewart Johnston discusses balancing passionate traditional fans with growth imperatives, media rights strategy, and his 10-year vision including league expansion"

### Interview Content - Key Topics Covered:

**Career Journey & TSN/Bell Background (00:00-04:30)** - 27 years at Bell Media/TSN, led 3,600+ person team across entertainment, news, sports, and ad sales. Deep CFL partnership history from the media side before transitioning to commissioner role.

**Commissioner as CEO Role (04:30-10:00)** - Approaches role as CEO, not just figurehead. Primary revenue drivers: media rights and commercial partnerships. Gate revenue critical for teams. Accountability to nine team owners who "have to deliver returns."

**Media Rights & Revenue Strategy (10:00-15:00)** - Media rights and sponsorship as league's biggest revenue buckets. Ratings as fandom indicator. Must make content "so valuable" it drives subscriptions AND advertising. Explains negotiation dynamics when media partners evaluate CFL value.

**Tradition vs. Innovation Challenge (15:00-22:00)** - Core challenge: loyal 30-40 year season ticket holders vs. need to grow new customer base. "Not unique to CFL" - many industries face this. Must respect passionate traditionalist fans while innovating to attract younger audiences.

**Three Strategic Priorities (22:00-28:00)** - (1) Relentless focus on entertainment (Machine Gun Kelly halftime, music integration), (2) Getting footballs into kids' hands (youth engagement), (3) Creating nine profitable teams ("we're not there yet"). Olympics flag football as growth opportunity.

**10-Year Vision & Expansion (28:00-35:00)** - Expansion NOT in top 3 priorities, but expects 10th team within 10 years. "Great markets across this country that could support a team." Hopes to be recognized as "top tier professional sports league in North America." Brand positioning as key strategic goal.

### Capstone Project Connection:
Stewart's interview provides direct insight into how a commissioner thinks about expansion. When students design their CFL expansion franchise brand package, they should consider Stewart's priorities:
1. Does the expansion enhance entertainment value?
2. Does it grow youth engagement?
3. Can the 10th team be profitable?
4. How does it strengthen CFL's brand positioning?

### Viewing Guide for Students:
- **League Leadership:** CEO mindset vs. ceremonial commissioner role
- **Revenue Model:** Media rights + sponsorship as primary league-level revenue (gate for teams)
- **Tradition/Innovation Balance:** Same tension as HHOF/MLSE but at league scale with passionate fans
- **Expansion Criteria:** What makes a market "great" for expansion? Profitability, brand fit, fan passion
- **10-Year Vision:** How commissioners think strategically about league positioning

## Element 8: Discussion Prompt - Stewart Johnston Session

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Discussion Prompt** element in module builder
2. Copy the markdown below into the element field


## Reflection: League Leadership & Expansion Strategy

**Watch Stewart Johnston's session above, then reflect on these questions. This is a forum discussion—post your thoughts and respond to at least one classmate.**

### Prompt 1: Commissioner as CEO
Stewart explicitly describes his role as a "CEO job," not just a ceremonial commissioner position. He's accountable to nine team owners who expect growth and profitability.

Compare this to:
- How does a league commissioner's accountability differ from Jamie's (stakeholder constraints) and Keith's (performance metrics)?
- What unique challenges does Stewart face that neither an institution CEO nor a franchise CEO would face?
- How does managing NINE competing team owners change decision-making vs. managing a single organization?

**Suggested length:** 150-200 words

---

### Prompt 2: Expansion as Strategic Choice
Stewart says expansion is NOT in his top 3 priorities, but he expects a 10th team within 10 years. He mentions "great markets across this country."

Apply this to your capstone project:
- If you were advising Stewart on expansion, what criteria would you use to evaluate a market?
- How do Stewart's three priorities (entertainment, youth engagement, profitability) become decision criteria for expansion?
- What's the risk of expanding before achieving the three priorities vs. waiting too long?

**Suggested length:** 150-200 words

---

### Prompt 3: Balancing Passionate Traditionalists with Growth
Stewart describes the CFL's core fans as 30-40 year season ticket holders who are "absolutely passionate." He must grow new audiences without alienating them.

This is the SAME tension Jamie and Keith face, but at league scale. Compare:
- How is Stewart's tradition/innovation challenge similar to Jamie's (HHOF) and Keith's (MLSE)?
- How is it different? (Hint: Stewart has NINE markets, each with different fan bases)
- What can Stewart learn from Jamie and Keith's approaches?

**Suggested length:** 150-200 words

---

### Prompt 4: Media Rights as League Revenue
Stewart emphasizes media rights and sponsorship as the league's primary revenue drivers (gate revenue goes to teams).

Connect to Week 2:
- How does Stewart's media rights strategy connect to what you learned about Rogers' NHL deal?
- What leverage does a league like CFL have vs. what NHL had when negotiating with Rogers?
- How should expansion impact media rights value? (More markets = more value? Or diluted brand?)

**Suggested length:** 100-150 words

## Element 9: Comparison Prompt - Three-Way Synthesis

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Discussion Prompt** element in module builder
2. Copy the markdown below into the element field


## Synthesis: Where All Three Executives Agree (and Disagree)

**Watch all three executive sessions, then engage with this comparison prompt. This is an individual reflection—you can submit as written response or forum post.**

### The Three-Way Tension Map

Jamie Dinsmore, Keith Pelley, and Stewart Johnston all face heritage property challenges, but from three distinct vantage points:

| | Jamie Dinsmore (HHOF) | Keith Pelley (MLSE) | Stewart Johnston (CFL) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Organization Type** | Heritage institution (museum) | Modern franchise (team) | Heritage league (commissioner) |
| **Core Asset** | Authenticity of artifacts | Emotional connection to identity | Passionate fan tradition + brand positioning |
| **Risk from Aggressiveness** | Loss of credibility, donor withdrawal | Can be absorbed by franchise scale | Alienate 30-40 year traditionalists |
| **View of Heritage** | Constraint on innovation | Fuel for growth | Foundation requiring modernization |
| **Stakeholder Accountability** | Curatorial staff, donors, partner leagues | Performance metrics (playoff success, revenue) | Nine team owners expecting profitability |
| **Growth Strategy** | Conservative extension of reach | Aggressive digital/global expansion | Entertainment focus + expansion readiness |
| **Innovation Approach** | Extend reach without replacing core | Leverage heritage for fan engagement | Music, halftime, youth programs |

### Your Analysis

Where do all three executives **actually agree**, even though their contexts differ significantly?

Give 2-3 specific examples where their underlying principles align, even if their risk tolerance and execution strategies differ.

(Example: All three emphasize that innovation must SERVE the brand's core purpose, not REPLACE it. Jamie calls this avoiding "Disneyfication." Keith calls it "purpose-driven innovation." Stewart calls it "respecting passionate fans while growing.")

---

### The Strategic Choice

If you were developing 5-year strategy for a heritage property, would you use Jamie's conservative framework or Keith's aggressive framework?

Explain your reasoning. What factors would influence your choice?

**Consider:**
- What TYPE of heritage property? (Museum, hall of fame, historic venue, Olympic legacy?)
- What stakeholders do you answer to?
- What revenue growth are you targeting?

**Suggested length:** 200-300 words

## Module 2 Complete - Transition to Module 3

**What You've Learned:**

You've now heard from three executives who navigate heritage property strategy from different perspectives:

- **Jamie Dinsmore** protects an institution where the PAST has economic value. He must carefully preserve authenticity while achieving financial sustainability. His stakeholders (curatorial staff, donors, partner leagues) have veto power over strategy, forcing a conservative but defensible approach.

- **Keith Pelley** operates franchises where CURRENT PERFORMANCE and EMOTIONAL CONNECTION drive value. He can innovate aggressively because his heritage is identity-based, not artifact-based. His stakeholder accountability is performance-driven, allowing higher risk tolerance.

- **Stewart Johnston** leads a league where PASSIONATE TRADITIONALISTS must be respected while growing new audiences. He balances nine competing team owners, media partnerships, and a 100+ year heritage with expansion ambitions.

**Key Insights from This Module:**

1. **Heritage institutions, franchises, and leagues face different strategic constraints**, even though all are heritage properties
2. **Authenticity is a business asset**, not just a cultural value—it drives revenue and stakeholder relationships
3. **Stakeholders determine your strategic freedom**—different accountability structures lead to different growth models
4. **Purpose-driven innovation is the unifying principle**—whether conservative or aggressive, the best strategies SERVE the organization's core mission
5. **Expansion requires strategic readiness**—Stewart's three priorities (entertainment, youth, profitability) must be achieved before expansion

**The Emerging Framework:**

All three executives validate the decision principle:
- ✅ If innovation SERVES authenticity and extends the organization's core mission → Approved
- ❌ If innovation REPLACES authenticity with pure entertainment ("Disneyfication") → Rejected

The difference is in HOW MUCH RISK you can take, given your stakeholder constraints and growth expectations.

**Capstone Connection:**
Stewart's expansion perspective directly informs your CFL brand package project. His three priorities become your evaluation criteria: Does your expansion proposal enhance entertainment value? Grow youth engagement? Create a profitable 10th team? Strengthen CFL brand positioning?

**Up Next: Module 3 - Core Content & Interactive Frameworks**

Now that you've heard real-world perspective from three experienced executives, Module 3 will teach you the systematic frameworks for making these trade-off decisions yourself. You'll learn the **Legacy vs. Innovation Matrix** to map strategic initiatives, the **Heritage Property Analyzer** to model revenue scenarios, and the **Future Trends Simulator** to forecast how emerging trends will impact heritage properties.
