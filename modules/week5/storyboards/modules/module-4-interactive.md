## Element 1: The Heritage Dilemma

**Uplift Implementation:**
1. Select **Text** element
2. Copy markdown below:

```markdown
## How Do You Grow Without Losing Your Soul?

The Hockey Hall of Fame faces a choice every heritage property confronts:

**The Problem:**
- Attendance down 22% since 2019
- Digital revenue is 1% (competitors: 18-22%)
- Zero tech staff

**The Board's Mandate:** Grow from $18M to $35M revenue by 2029.

**The Tension:** Aggressive growth might destroy the credibility that makes HHOF valuable.

Three strategic paths. Each has trade-offs. None is obviously right.

In this module, you'll explore the scenarios. In Module 5, you'll apply these insights using the Heritage Transformation Strategist to design your own approach.
```

## Element 2: Video - HHOF Strategic Analysis Framework

**Video Specifications:**
- **Length:** 2 minutes
- **Topic:** "HHOF Case: Strategic Analysis Framework"
- **File:** `week5-hhof-strategic-analysis.mp4`
- **Key Points:** The heritage dilemma, two traps to avoid (assuming growth always wins; assuming tradition always wins), the credibility risk
- **Accessibility:** Captions required, transcript provided

**Key Quote:** "Once you're perceived as a theme park, you can't go back to being a serious cultural institution."

**Uplift Implementation:**
1. Upload video MP4
2. Add SRT caption file
3. Place after intro text

## Element 3: Three Scenarios at a Glance

**Uplift Implementation:**
1. Select **Text** element
2. Copy markdown table below:

```markdown
## Three Strategic Paths: At a Glance

| Factor | PRESERVE | TRANSFORM | HYBRID |
|--------|----------|-----------|--------|
| **2029 Revenue** | $21.2M (+17%) | $42.6M (+135%) | $35.1M (+94%) |
| **Capital Required** | $2.1M | $15.2M | $6.8M |
| **Debt Required** | $0 | $10M | $0-1.6M |
| **Achieves $35M Goal?** | No | Yes | Yes |
| **Risk if it fails** | Slow decline | $10M debt + crisis | Manageable |
| **Heritage preserved?** | Yes | At risk | Protected |
| **Curator support** | Full | 8/12 would resign | Supported |
| **Donor support** | 94% retain | 47% retain | 89% retain |

**Key Insight:** PRESERVE is safe but misses the growth target. TRANSFORM hits the target but risks losing curators, donors, and institutional credibility. HYBRID achieves the goal with lower risk—but requires strategic discipline.

## Element 4: Stakeholder Impact Summary

**Uplift Implementation:**
1. Select **Text** element
2. Copy markdown table below:

```markdown
## Who Wins, Who Loses?

| Stakeholder | PRESERVE | TRANSFORM | HYBRID |
|-------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Curators** (12 senior staff) | Happy | 8 resign | Supported |
| **Major Donors** ($2.1M/year) | 94% stay | 47% stay | 89% stay |
| **Corporate Sponsors** | Disappointed | Excited | Satisfied |
| **Younger Visitors** (18-35) | 15% return | "Would depend" | 41% return |
| **Non-curator Staff** (65 FTE) | 72% feel secure | 31% feel secure | 58% feel secure |
| **Board** | Frustrated (miss goal) | Divided | 7/11 support |

**The Reality:** No scenario makes everyone happy. The board's preliminary vote was 7-4 for Hybrid—but "Hybrid" only works if you execute with discipline. It's easy to start Hybrid and drift into Transform.

In Module 5, you'll test different approaches using the Heritage Transformation Strategist to see which trade-offs you'd accept.

## Element 5: Full Case Background (Optional)

**Uplift Implementation:**
1. Select **Details/Accordion** element
2. Title: "Want the Full Case? (Optional Reading)"
3. Copy markdown below:

```markdown
### Part 1: The Heritage Challenge

The Hockey Hall of Fame controls:
- The official induction ceremony
- The Stanley Cup (8 months/year physical custody)
- 40,000+ artifacts
- Partnerships with NHL, Hockey Canada

**Current Revenue:** $18.1M
- Admissions: $6.8M (down 19%)
- Events: $5.4M (only growth area)
- Sponsorship: $3.8M
- Digital: $0.2M (1%)

**Competitive Gap:**

| Metric | HHOF | FIFA Museum | Olympics Museum |
|--------|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Digital Revenue % | 1% | 22% | 18% |
| Tech Staff | 0 | 22 | 14 |
| Digital Members | 0 | 120K | 95K |

---

### Part 2: The Three Scenarios in Detail

**PRESERVE:** Curatorial excellence, premium in-person experiences, basic digital refresh. Safe but misses growth target.

**TRANSFORM:** VR arena, 4 international pop-ups, betting partnerships, influencer strategy. High growth but risks identity crisis.

**HYBRID:** Interactive heritage, selective digital membership, 2 domestic pop-ups, curatorial guardrails. Balanced but harder to execute.

### Exhibit A: 5-Year Financial Projections

**PRESERVE:**
- 2029 Revenue: $21.2M
- Pessimistic scenario: $18.9M
- No debt required

**TRANSFORM:**
- 2029 Revenue: $42.6M
- Pessimistic scenario: $31.4M (fails goal + carries $10M debt)
- Requires $10M financing

**HYBRID:**
- 2029 Revenue: $35.1M
- Pessimistic scenario: $32.1M (still +77% growth)
- Self-fundable

---

### Exhibit B: Stakeholder Quotes

**Senior Curator:** "Transform is a dealbreaker—we'll resign."

**Heritage Donor:** "If you become just another entertainment venue, we'd redirect our donations."

**Corporate Sponsor:** "We're not buying into tradition—we're buying into a growth platform."

**Young Visitor (24):** "It felt like a museum from the 90s."

## Element 6: Infobox - What's Next

**Uplift Implementation:**
1. Select **Infobox** element
2. Choose variant: **Next Steps** (green)
3. Copy markdown below:

```markdown
Title: ✓ What's Next: Module 5

**After exploring the HHOF scenarios:**

You understand the dilemma: $35M target, stakeholder tensions, three strategic paths. Now put yourself in the strategic director's seat.

Module 5 uses the Heritage Transformation Strategist simulation. You'll:
- Select "Hall of Fame" as your property type
- Set current state to "Declining" (matches HHOF's situation)
- Allocate a $25M transformation budget
- Navigate stakeholder decisions
- See your 5-year outcomes

**Your challenge:** Can you hit the $35M target without destroying HHOF's credibility?

Continue to Module 5 when ready.
```

## Instructor Notes

**Module 4 Purpose:**
- Provide HHOF case context before simulation
- ~10-15 minutes of context-setting
- No graded assessment

**Module Flow (4-5-6):**
1. Module 4: HHOF context (video + tables) - understand the dilemma (~10-15 min)
2. Module 5: Apply to HHOF using Heritage Transformation Strategist (~15-20 min)
3. Module 6: 25-point reflection on strategic insights

**Why This Structure:**
- Context → Application → Reflection is proven pedagogical sequence
- Students understand HHOF specifics before running simulation
- Simulation becomes meaningful because they know the stakeholder tensions
- Reflection captures learning after experiential activity

**Total Time Estimate:**
- Video: 2 minutes
- Tables review: 5-8 minutes
- Optional case reading: 10-15 minutes (optional)
- **Total Module 4 time: ~10-15 minutes (core)**

**File Status:** ✅ Complete and ready for Uplimit implementation
