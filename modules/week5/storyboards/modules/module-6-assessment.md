Title: Week 5 Key Takeaways

You've completed your deep dive into legacy, culture, and the future of sports business! The five critical insights: (1) heritage properties monetize nostalgia and tradition through experiences, not just artifacts-the Hockey Hall of Fame shows how to balance preservation with revenue generation, (2) legacy vs. innovation requires explicit trade-off analysis because you can't preserve everything while transforming-successful properties draw clear boundaries, (3) future trends including AI, VR/AR, sustainability, and global expansion will reshape sports business within the next decade, (4) cultural and social impact considerations are increasingly strategic decisions, not just PR-stakeholders expect authentic engagement, and (5) strategic synthesis means integrating all frameworks into a coherent vision where media, sponsorship, athlete brands, and legacy management reinforce each other. You've now mastered the complete sports business toolkit. Congratulations on completing this 5-week journey!

**Up Next:** CFL Expansion Milestone 5 (Final Proposal).

## CFL Expansion Project: Milestone 5 - Final Expansion Proposal

This is it. You've spent four weeks developing your CFL expansion franchise: market analysis (Week 1), media strategy (Week 2), sponsorship portfolio (Week 3), and brand launch plan (Week 4). Now you'll synthesize everything into a comprehensive expansion proposal for the CFL Board of Governors.

**Your Challenge:** Create a board-ready expansion proposal that integrates Milestones 1-4 with financial projections, risk analysis, and a compelling 5-year vision.

**Why This Matters:** This is the real work sports executives do. Expansion proposals aren't academic exercises-they're multi-million dollar decisions that determine whether leagues grow, markets get teams, and careers are made.

**Apply ALL Course Frameworks:**
- Revenue ecosystem analysis (Week 1) for financial projections
- Media rights valuation (Week 2) for broadcast strategy
- Sponsorship ROI (Week 3) for partnership portfolio
- Brand building (Week 4) for launch strategy
- Legacy vs. innovation (Week 5) for long-term positioning
