## Element 1: Connecting Introduction

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Text** element
2. Copy markdown below:

```markdown
## From Practice to Performance

In Module 5, you analyzed the Hockey Hall of Fame case in depth—reading the case narrative, reviewing financial exhibits, examining stakeholder perspectives, and practicing your recommendation with the HHOF Board through the AI Roleplay.

Now it's time to put your strategic thinking in writing.

The board has heard your pitch. They were impressed, but they want it formalized. They need a clear, data-driven executive memo that captures your recommendation and the reasoning behind it.

**Your Task:** Write a 1-page HHOF Strategic Recommendation Memo presenting your chosen strategy (Preserve, Transform, or Hybrid) with evidence-based justification.
```

**Required Components:**

1. **Strategic Recommendation (Clear Choice)**
   - Commit to ONE path: PRESERVE, TRANSFORM, or HYBRID

   - Address stakeholder concerns (curators, donors, younger audiences)

3. **Implementation & Risk**
   - Identify capital requirements and financing approach
   - Propose 2-3 metrics to measure success
   - Acknowledge key risks and mitigation strategies

**Grading Rubric (40 points):**
- Strategic Clarity (10 pts): Clear recommendation with explicit trade-off acknowledgment

- Stakeholder Awareness (10 pts): Addresses competing interests and risk mitigation
- Business Communication (10 pts): Memo format, clear writing, 500-word limit

**Preparation:** If you haven't already, complete the AI Roleplay in Module 5 to practice your arguments before writing.

**Rubric Configuration:**

---

**CRITERION 1: Strategic Clarity**

**Points:** 10

**Does not meet expectations (0-3 pts):**
Recommendation is unclear or waffles between options. No acknowledgment of trade-offs. Strategic implications not articulated.

**Partially meets expectations (4-6 pts):**
Makes a recommendation but reasoning is incomplete. Some trade-offs mentioned but not systematically analyzed. Doesn't clearly explain why this path beats alternatives.

**Fully meets expectations (7-10 pts):**
Clearly commits to ONE path with explicit reasoning. Acknowledges what's being sacrificed by not choosing alternatives. Uses scenario analysis (base case, pessimistic) to justify the choice. Example: "I recommend Hybrid because it achieves the board's $35M target while avoiding the $10M debt and curator resignation risks of Transform."

---

**CRITERION 2: Case Evidence**

**Points:** 10

**Does not meet expectations (0-3 pts):**
Minimal or no reference to case data. Relies on generalizations or opinions not grounded in exhibits.

**Partially meets expectations (4-6 pts):**
Mentions exhibits but with limited specificity. May cite some numbers but doesn't connect them to the strategic argument.

**Fully meets expectations (7-10 pts):**
Cites specific data: "Exhibit A shows attendance down 22% since 2019" / "Exhibit B projects Hybrid reaching $35.1M with 14-16% margins" / "Exhibit C indicates 8/12 curators would resign under Transform." Data directly supports the recommendation.

---

**CRITERION 3: Stakeholder Awareness**

**Points:** 10

**Does not meet expectations (0-3 pts):**
Ignores stakeholder concerns. Assumes tensions will resolve without intervention. No risk mitigation.

**Partially meets expectations (4-6 pts):**
Recognizes some stakeholder tensions but addresses them superficially. May overlook critical groups (curators, donors, younger audiences).

**Fully meets expectations (7-10 pts):**
Explicitly addresses multiple stakeholder groups and their concerns. Explains how the recommendation mitigates risks for each. Example: "Hybrid protects curatorial integrity through binding guardrails (preventing curator resignations), maintains 89% donor support (vs. 47% in Transform), and offers digital membership to engage younger audiences."

---

**CRITERION 4: Business Communication**

**Points:** 10

**Does not meet expectations (0-3 pts):**
Not in memo format. Exceeds 500 words significantly. Unclear or disorganized writing.

**Partially meets expectations (4-6 pts):**
Memo format attempted but incomplete. Writing is adequate but could be clearer. May be slightly over/under word limit.

**Fully meets expectations (7-10 pts):**
Professional memo format (To, From, Date, Subject, Body). Clear, concise writing. 500-word limit respected. Logical flow from recommendation → evidence → risk mitigation → metrics.

---

**Template:** No template required (students should demonstrate professional memo formatting)

## Element 4: Infobox - What's Next

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Infobox** element
2. Choose variant: **Next Steps** (green)
3. Copy markdown below:

```

- Course Completion & Celebration

Complete your HHOF memo submission, then continue to Module 7.
```

## Instructor Notes

**Module 6 Purpose:**
- Assess Week 5 learning through HHOF strategic recommendation
- Builds directly on Module 5 case analysis and formative roleplay practice
- Clean handoff to Module 7 (CFL Expansion milestone submission)

**Assessment Flow (Modules 5-6):**
1. Module 5: Students read HHOF case, analyze exhibits, practice recommendation via AI Roleplay (formative)
2. Module 6: Students write formal memo presenting their recommendation (summative, 40 pts)

**Why HHOF-Specific (Not Generic):**
- Students invested 90+ minutes in HHOF case analysis
- Generic "any heritage property" memo wastes that investment
- HHOF-specific memo tests whether they actually learned the case, not just frameworks
- Cleaner pedagogical flow: practice → write about SAME topic

**UDL Learning Supports (Optional):**
If you want to provide additional scaffolding, these resources can be developed:
- **Guided Demo Video** (6 min): SME think-aloud walkthrough of memo writing
- **Annotated Exemplar Explorer**: Interactive side-by-side comparison (developing → exemplary)
- **Audio Instructions** (4 min): Voice-narrated assignment overview

These can be added as optional Details elements or linked from the LMS.

**Grading Notes:**
- Look for clear commitment to ONE path (not hedging)
- Verify they reference specific exhibit data (not just "the data shows...")
- Trade-off acknowledgment is key: What are they giving up by not choosing alternatives?
- Memo format matters: This is an executive communication skill

**Alternative Assessment:**
Students who prefer not to write can request to submit a 3-minute video presentation instead, evaluated on the same rubric criteria.
