### Element 1: Connecting Introduction Text
**Copy this markdown directly into Uplimit:**


You've completed an intensive 5-week journey through the business of sports marketing. You started by mapping revenue ecosystems in Week 1, explored media rights valuation and fan engagement in Week 2, analyzed sponsorship ROI and betting markets in Week 3, examined athlete branding and emerging sports in Week 4, and now in Week 5 you've tackled the unique challenge of heritage properties balancing tradition with innovation.

You've analyzed the Hockey Hall of Fame's strategic dilemma, experimented with the Legacy vs Innovation Matrix, modeled heritage property revenue scenarios, and forecasted future trends in sports business. You've learned from executives like Jamie Dinsmore (HHOF) and Keith Pelley (MLSE) who navigate these tensions daily.

Now it's time to demonstrate the full scope of what you've learned. In this capstone assessment, you'll step into the role of Chief Strategy Officer for a sports property of your choice‚Äîa professional team, league, venue, heritage institution, or major event. Your Board of Directors needs a comprehensive 5-year strategic vision that integrates everything from revenue streams to future trends, from media strategy to legacy management. Your task: create an executive strategy memo that synthesizes all five weeks into a cohesive, actionable roadmap for the future.

**Optional PAIRR Bonus (5 points):** This capstone assessment includes an optional Peer and AI Review + Reflection (PAIRR) process. Submit your draft by Day 5, receive peer and AI feedback by Day 7, and earn up to 5 bonus points for thoughtful engagement with the feedback process (2 pts peer review + 1 pt AI feedback + 1 pt comparative reflection + 1 pt post-revision reflection). Total possible: 105 points.

### Element 4: AI Roleplay - Board of Directors Strategy Pitch

**üéÆ Widget Purpose:** Formative practice where students rehearse their strategic vision presentation to a skeptical Board of Directors, receiving AI feedback to strengthen their arguments, identify gaps, and refine their executive communication before writing the final memo.

**Widget Status:** ‚≠ï Needs configuration in Uplimit platform

**Element Type:** AI Roleplay (4-tab configuration)

---

## UPLIMIT CONFIGURATION

### Tab 1: Learning Objective

**Name:** Board of Directors Strategy Pitch: 5-Year Vision Presentation

**Learning Objective:**
Students will practice articulating comprehensive strategic vision integrating 5 weeks of course frameworks, defending trade-off decisions, and responding to executive-level challenges. This supports MLOs 5.1-5.4 and CLOs 1-5 (Evaluate/Create level) while developing board-level communication skills.

**Scenario Setup:**
Formative practice conversation (not graded)

---

### Tab 2: Scenario

**Context:**
The learner has been promoted to Chief Strategy Officer of a sports property (team, league, venue, heritage institution, or event). The Board of Directors has requested a 5-year strategic vision addressing revenue growth, media strategy, fan engagement, sponsorship opportunities, athlete/brand partnerships, legacy management, and future trends. The board is sophisticated, data-driven, and skeptical‚Äîthey want to see integration of business fundamentals, not generic sports industry platitudes. The learner will present their strategic vision to Board Chair Dr. Patricia Martinez in a 10-minute practice pitch. This is a formative practice conversation (not graded) designed to help the learner identify gaps, strengthen arguments, and refine their executive communication before writing the final memo.

**Role of AI (Dr. Patricia Martinez):** Dr. Patricia Martinez is Board Chair with 20 years of experience in private equity, strategic consulting, and corporate governance. She has led boards for Fortune 500 companies and understands business strategy deeply, but this is her first sports industry board appointment. She is analytical, direct, and expects data-driven reasoning backed by course frameworks.

**Role of Student:** The learner plays the role of Chief Strategy Officer presenting a 5-year strategic vision to the Board Chair.

---

### Tab 3: Hidden Context

**Hidden Context (AI knows, student doesn't see):**

**AI Character Personality:**
You are Dr. Patricia Martinez, Board Chair with 20 years of experience in private equity, strategic consulting, and corporate governance. You've led boards for Fortune 500 companies (tech, healthcare, consumer goods) but this is your FIRST sports industry board appointment. You understand business fundamentals (strategy, finance, competitive positioning) but NOT sports-specific nuances. You're analytical, direct, and expect data-driven reasoning. You ask tough questions to stress-test the strategy and identify weaknesses before presenting to the full board.

**Key Constraints:**
- Limited sports industry knowledge‚Äîneed concepts explained clearly with business logic
- Evaluating multi-million dollar strategic investments (high stakes, need confidence)
- Familiar with traditional strategy frameworks (Porter's Five Forces, growth matrices, competitive moats)
- Skeptical of "sports is different" claims unless backed by data and clear reasoning
- Concerned about risk management and downside protection

**Conversation Strategy (6 Questions):**

1. **Opening:** "Walk me through your 5-year vision at a high level. What are the 3-4 big strategic bets you're making?"
   - Test if they have a coherent narrative and clear strategic priorities
   - Look for integration across weeks, not disconnected ideas

2. **Week 1 Revenue Deep Dive:** "Let's talk revenue. You mentioned [revenue stream]. What's your current revenue mix, and how will it shift over 5 years? Why?"
   - Test Week 1 framework application (revenue ecosystem thinking)
   - Probe for specific percentages and growth projections

3. **Weeks 2-4 Integration:** "How does your media strategy support your sponsorship strategy? Are these initiatives coordinated or separate?"
   - Test integration of Weeks 2-4 concepts (not siloed thinking)
   - Challenge disconnected ideas: "How do these connect?"

4. **Week 5 Trade-offs:** "Every strategy involves trade-offs. What are you sacrificing to achieve this vision? What's the downside risk?"
   - Test Week 5 legacy vs innovation thinking
   - Reward candor about risks and constraints

5. **Financial Viability:** "Show me the numbers. What's the investment required, and what's the projected ROI over 5 years?"
   - Test if they've thought through financial implications
   - Push for specificity: "Where will that funding come from?"

6. **Closing:** "I need to present this to the full board next week. What's the one-sentence pitch that will get them excited?"
   - Test ability to distill complex strategy into compelling narrative

**Reward Strong Performance (use for evaluation):**
- ‚úÖ Clear strategic narrative connecting all 5 weeks (not random ideas)
- ‚úÖ Specific data and projections: "Media rights will grow from 45% to 52% of revenue by Year 3..."
- ‚úÖ Integration of frameworks: "Our sponsorship strategy depends on fan engagement data from Week 2's streaming platform..."
- ‚úÖ Honest risk assessment: "The biggest risk is cannibalization of ticket revenue if virtual experiences succeed..."
- ‚úÖ Financial specificity: "$15M investment in Years 1-2, projected 22% ROI by Year 5"
- ‚úÖ Executive communication: Concise, confident, uses analogies to explain sports concepts

**Provide Constructive Feedback:**
- If disconnected: "I'm seeing separate initiatives. How do these pieces fit together?"
- If vague: "Can you be more specific? What are the actual numbers?"
- If jargon-heavy: "I'm not familiar with that term‚Äîexplain it in business strategy language."
- If missing trade-offs: "What are you NOT doing? Every strategy has constraints."
- If strong: "That's compelling. Walk me through the implementation‚Äîwhat happens in Year 1?"

**After completing 6 questions:** Provide comprehensive feedback framed as: "Here's what will resonate with the board... Here are the gaps you need to address in your written memo... Here's where you need more specificity or data..."

## SECTION A EXAMPLES: CLO APPLICATION

### CLO 1: Revenue Ecosystem Analysis (15 points)

**Excellent Example (12-15 pts):**
> "The Toronto Raptors currently generate revenue through five streams: National media rights (42%), Local media rights (18%), Ticketing and premium seating (22%), Sponsorship and partnerships (13%), and Retail and licensing (5%). This 'shared-first' model reflects the NBA's centralized structure where national media rights are distributed equally across all 30 teams, creating competitive balance but limiting local upside potential.
>
> Over the next 5 years, I project a strategic shift: National media will decline to 38% as we capture local digital opportunities (growing from 18% to 25%), while premium experiences will increase from 22% to 24% as we renovate Scotiabank Arena. This evolution recognizes the interdependency: Our local streaming platform (launching Year 2) generates fan engagement data that increases both sponsorship ROI and premium seat conversion rates by 15-20%. The ecosystem thinking means we're not just adding a revenue stream‚Äîwe're creating multiplier effects across all streams."

**Why this is excellent:**
- ‚úÖ Specific current percentages for all revenue streams
- ‚úÖ Explains NBA's shared economics model (ecosystem thinking)
- ‚úÖ Projects future evolution with clear rationale
- ‚úÖ Demonstrates interdependencies (streaming ‚Üí data ‚Üí sponsorship/premium seats)
- ‚úÖ References Week 1 concepts (competitive balance, shared vs. local)

---

**Proficient Example (9-11 pts):**
> "The team currently makes money from media rights (about 50%), tickets (30%), sponsorships (15%), and merchandise (5%). In the next 5 years, we want to grow digital media and premium experiences because those have higher margins. We'll launch a streaming app in Year 2 and renovate suites in Year 3."

**Why this is proficient but not excellent:**
- ‚úÖ Provides revenue breakdown (though approximations)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited explanation of interdependencies
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Doesn't explain WHY these streams have higher margins
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing ecosystem thinking (treats streams as independent)

---

### CLO 2: Media Rights & Fan Engagement Strategy (15 points)

**Excellent Example (12-15 pts):**
> "Building on the Rogers/Sportsnet case from Week 2, our media strategy addresses the fundamental tension between league-controlled national rights and team-controlled local rights. While our NBA national media deal is locked through 2030, we have flexibility in local markets.
>
> Year 1-2: Launch 'Raptors+' DTC streaming platform for non-nationally televised games (estimated 25 games/season), priced at $89/year with tiered membership (ad-supported free tier, premium tier with exclusive content). This targets the 2.3M GTA fans who've cut cable but still want Raptors content.
>
> Year 3-4: Leverage first-party data from 500K+ Raptors+ subscribers to create 'Premium Fan Profiles' sold to sponsors at 3x CPM rates vs. broadcast ($45 vs $15 CPM), generating $3.2M additional sponsorship revenue.
>
> Year 5: Negotiate regional sports network (RSN) renewal with Rogers, armed with DTC subscriber data proving we can monetize direct relationships at higher margins than traditional broadcast splits (projected 40% revenue increase from $12M to $17M annually)."

**Why this is excellent:**
- ‚úÖ Applies Week 2 framework (DTC models, streaming economics)
- ‚úÖ References Week 2 case study (Rogers/Sportsnet)
- ‚úÖ Specific numbers (subscriber targets, pricing, CPM rates)
- ‚úÖ Shows integration: DTC data ‚Üí sponsorship optimization
- ‚úÖ Phased implementation with clear milestones

---

### CLO 3: Sponsorship & Betting Strategy (15 points)

**Excellent Example (12-15 pts):**
> "Following the FanDuel Week 3 case study insights, we'll shift sponsorship strategy from asset-based sales ('buy a logo') to ROI-based partnerships ('achieve measurable outcomes'). Current sponsorship revenue is $8.5M across 23 partners, with minimal activation tracking beyond logo visibility.
>
> Year 1: Implement 'Sponsorship Analytics Platform' using Raptors+ streaming data and venue sensors to track actual fan engagement (dwell time at activations, QR code scans, app interactions). Pilot with 5 existing sponsors, demonstrating 35% higher engagement vs. control group.
>
> Year 2-3: Re-price sponsorship tiers based on proven ROI metrics. Premium tier partners ($500K+) receive custom dashboards, quarterly optimization, and performance guarantees. Projected revenue increase: $8.5M ‚Üí $11.2M (32% growth) with SAME number of partners but higher retention (95% vs current 72%).
>
> Betting Strategy (Year 3-5): Partner with single sports betting operator for exclusive 'Official Betting Partner' designation ($2M/year guarantee + 3% revenue share on Raptors-specific bets). Key consideration from Week 3: Ontario's regulated betting market allows partnerships without brand dilution risks. Integration with Raptors+ app creates seamless in-game betting experience, projected to drive $800K additional revenue share annually by Year 5."

**Why this is excellent:**
- ‚úÖ Applies Week 3 ROI framework explicitly
- ‚úÖ References FanDuel case study
- ‚úÖ Specific activation metrics and measurement approach
- ‚úÖ Financial projections with clear assumptions
- ‚úÖ Addresses betting partnerships with regulatory awareness
- ‚úÖ Shows integration: betting ‚Üí app ‚Üí fan engagement

---

### CLO 4: Athlete Branding & Emerging Sports (15 points)

**Excellent Example (12-15 pts):**
> "Inspired by the Serena Williams Week 4 case, we'll treat star athletes as brand assets, not just roster costs. Current approach: Players are salaried employees with team controlling all IP outside individual endorsements. New approach: Collaborative brand building that benefits both team and players.
>
> Year 1-2: Launch 'Raptors Creator Fund' investing $500K in player-led content for social media and Raptors+ streaming. Players retain creative control and 60% of incremental revenue from their content (team keeps 40%). Projected outcome: 3-5 players build authentic audiences (target: 500K+ followers each), generating $1.2M revenue Year 2 (team share: $480K, recovering initial investment).
>
> Year 3-5: Extend model to women's basketball partnership. Launch 'Raptors WNBA Affiliate' (expansion team if Toronto granted franchise, or partnership with existing team if not). Week 4 insights show women's sports audience growth (35% annually) and premium sponsorship CPM rates (brands pay premium for underserved audiences). Projected 5-year investment: $15M (partial ownership stake), projected valuation uplift: $35-50M based on recent WNBA expansion valuations.
>
> Strategic rationale: Women's basketball extends Raptors brand into high-growth demographic (women 18-34), creates year-round basketball content for Raptors+ platform (filling summer programming gap), and attracts 'purpose-driven' sponsors willing to pay premium for women's sports partnerships."

**Why this is excellent:**
- ‚úÖ Applies Week 4 athlete brand framework (Serena Williams case)
- ‚úÖ Specific financial model (revenue split, investment, projections)
- ‚úÖ Addresses emerging sports opportunity (women's basketball)
- ‚úÖ Shows integration: athlete content ‚Üí streaming platform ‚Üí sponsorship
- ‚úÖ Demonstrates understanding of women's sports economics from Week 4

---

### CLO 5: Legacy Management & Future Trends (15 points)

**Excellent Example (12-15 pts):**
> "The Raptors face a unique legacy challenge: We're a 30-year-old franchise (young by NHL/MLB standards) but the ONLY NBA team in Canada‚Äîgiving us heritage significance disproportionate to our age. The 2019 championship cemented our cultural importance, creating preservation vs. innovation tensions explored in Week 5.
>
> **Legacy vs Innovation Trade-offs (applying Week 5 HHOF framework):**
>
> PRESERVE (non-negotiable heritage assets):
> - 2019 championship narrative and 'We The North' brand identity
> - Community roots (youth programs, Raptors Foundation, multicultural engagement)
> - Physical heritage: Championship banner, retired jerseys, Jurassic Park tradition
>
> INNOVATE (growth imperatives requiring change):
> - Digital transformation: Can't rely on in-arena nostalgia when 90% of fans experience team digitally
> - Global expansion: Must evolve from 'Toronto's team' to 'Canada's team' to 'global basketball brand'
> - Technology adoption: AI-powered personalization, VR courtside experiences, blockchain ticketing
>
> **Strategic Balance (Years 1-5):**
> Year 1-2: 'Heritage storytelling' via Raptors+ documentary series (preserve) while launching VR courtside seats (innovate)
> Year 3-4: Physical '2019 Championship Experience' museum space at Scotiabank Arena (preserve) while expanding into Mexico and UK markets with pop-up fan experiences (innovate)
> Year 5: Legacy secured through balanced approach‚Äî60% of fans rate team as 'authentically Raptors' AND 40% of revenue comes from new sources launched post-2025.
>
> **Future Trends Assessment (applying Week 5 forecasting):**
> - AI Trend: Implement AI-powered personalization for Raptors+ (custom highlights, predictive content), projected 25% engagement increase
> - Demographic Trend: Target 'New Canadian' immigrants (35% of GTA population by 2030) with multilingual content and culturally relevant activations
> - Technology Trend: Blockchain-based 'Raptors Passport' NFT for ultimate fan loyalty program (not collectibles‚Äîutility-based membership)"

**Why this is excellent:**
- ‚úÖ Applies Week 5 legacy vs innovation framework explicitly
- ‚úÖ References HHOF case study parallel
- ‚úÖ Identifies specific trade-offs with clear boundaries
- ‚úÖ Forecasts future trends with strategic implications
- ‚úÖ Shows sophisticated balance between preservation and transformation

---

## SECTION B EXAMPLES: STRATEGIC SYNTHESIS

### Criterion 6: Strategic Integration & Systems Thinking (10 points)

**Excellent Example (8-10 pts):**
> "These five strategic initiatives don't operate in isolation‚Äîthey form an interconnected system where each component amplifies the others:
>
> **System Architecture:**
> 1. Raptors+ streaming platform (Week 2 media strategy) generates first-party fan data
> 2. Fan data enables ROI-based sponsorship pricing (Week 3), increasing CPM from $15 to $45
> 3. Higher sponsorship revenue funds Raptors Creator Fund (Week 4), supporting athlete content
> 4. Athlete content drives Raptors+ subscriptions (loop back to #1), creating flywheel effect
> 5. WNBA partnership (Week 4) fills summer content gap on Raptors+, increasing annual subscription value
> 6. All digital initiatives preserve 'We The North' heritage brand (Week 5) through authentic storytelling
>
> **Quantified Integration:**
> - Raptors+ alone generates $8M subscription revenue (500K subs √ó $89 √ó 18% margin)
> - BUT integrated system generates $23M: $8M direct + $3.2M sponsorship uplift + $1.2M athlete content + $2.5M betting revenue share + $8.1M women's basketball value creation
> - **Integration premium: 188%** (earning $23M from interconnected strategies vs. $8M from isolated initiative)"

**Why this is excellent:**
- ‚úÖ Explicitly shows how Weeks 2-5 strategies interconnect
- ‚úÖ Uses systems thinking language (flywheel, architecture, loops)
- ‚úÖ Quantifies integration value (not just describes it)
- ‚úÖ Demonstrates sophisticated strategic coherence

---

**Proficient Example (6-7 pts):**
> "Our strategy includes multiple components that work together. The streaming platform supports our sponsorship strategy by providing data. The athlete partnerships create content for the platform. The women's basketball investment gives us more content. All of these align with our goal of growing revenue while preserving our brand."

**Why this is proficient but not excellent:**
- ‚úÖ Recognizes strategies connect
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Describes connections but doesn't quantify integration value
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing systems thinking sophistication (flywheel effects, compound benefits)

---

### Criterion 7: Financial Viability & Execution Plan (10 points)

**Excellent Example (8-10 pts):**
> **5-Year Financial Summary:**
>
> | Investment Area | Year 1-2 | Year 3-4 | Year 5 | Total Investment | Projected ROI (5-Year) |
> |-----------------|----------|----------|--------|------------------|----------------------|
> | Raptors+ Platform | $4.5M | $2M | $1M | $7.5M | 287% ($21.5M return) |

> | WNBA Partnership | $3M | $5M | $7M | $15M | 167% ($25M valuation) |
> | Heritage Preservation | $2M | $1.5M | $1M | $4.5M | N/A (brand equity) |
> | **TOTAL** | **$11.8M** | **$9.4M** | **$9.6M** | **$30.8M** | **198% ($61M return)** |
>
> **Funding Sources:**
> - 60% from operating cash flow (team profitable, $8M EBITDA 2024)
> - 30% from MLSE parent company strategic investment ($9.2M committed)
> - 10% from NBA league investment fund (digital innovation grant, $3M approved)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**‚ùå Disconnected Initiatives:**
"We'll do streaming. Also, we'll do sponsorships. And betting. And women's sports."
‚Üí This is a list, not a strategy. Show how they connect!

**‚ùå Vague Projections:**
"Revenue will increase significantly over 5 years."
‚Üí Define "significantly" with specific numbers!

**‚ùå Missing Trade-offs:**
"We'll maximize revenue across all streams while preserving tradition and keeping ticket prices low."
‚Üí Strategy involves choices. What are you sacrificing?

**‚ùå Ignoring Course Content:**
Writing entire memo without citing a single case study, executive session, or course framework.
‚Üí This is a course assessment‚Äîdemonstrate what you learned!

**‚ùå Generic Sports Business:**
Could this memo apply to ANY team in ANY sport? Then it's too generic.
‚Üí Make it specific to YOUR chosen property's context!

### Element 8: AI Chat Widget Configuration

**Widget Name:** "Strategy Planning Assistant"

**System Prompt:**

You are a strategic planning assistant for MBA students creating 5-year strategic visions for sports properties. Your role is to:

1. Help students think through strategic frameworks from their course (Weeks 1-5)
2. Ask probing questions that reveal gaps or weak reasoning
3. Provide feedback on strategic logic and coherence
4. Suggest areas for deeper analysis or more specificity

DO NOT:
- Write content for students (never draft sections of their memo)
- Make specific recommendations (students must develop their own strategy)
- Provide financial projections (students must research and calculate)

DO:
- Ask clarifying questions: "How does your media strategy connect to your sponsorship strategy?"
- Challenge vague reasoning: "You mentioned 'significant growth'‚Äîcan you be more specific?"
- Identify missing elements: "You've addressed Weeks 1-3, but I don't see Week 4 athlete branding in your plan yet."
- Suggest frameworks: "Have you considered using the Legacy vs Innovation Matrix from Week 5 to analyze this trade-off?"

Your goal is to make students think more deeply, not to do the thinking for them. You are a Socratic coach, not a ghostwriter.

If students ask you to write sections, respond: "I can't write your memo for you, but I can help you think through the logic. What are you trying to communicate in this section? What evidence from the course supports your reasoning?"


**Welcome Message:**

I'm here to help you think through your 5-year strategic vision memo. I can:

‚úÖ Help you identify gaps in your strategy
‚úÖ Ask probing questions to strengthen your reasoning
‚úÖ Suggest course frameworks you might have missed
‚úÖ Challenge vague statements to push for specificity

‚ùå I won't write content for you or make strategic recommendations

What aspect of your strategic vision would you like to discuss?


**Show System Prompt:** No

- **Day 21:** Feedback returned to students

**Optional: PAIRR Integration (If Extending Timeline to 14 Days):**
If you want to include Peer and AI Review + Reflection (PAIRR) methodology like Week 1 Module 6, extend timeline to 14 days and insert Elements 4A-4C (Draft Submission, Peer Review, AI Feedback, Comparative Reflection) between current Elements 3 and 4. See Week 1 Module 6 PAIRR implementation for detailed workflow.

### Grading Efficiency Strategies:

**Time-Saving Approaches:**
1. **AI-Assisted First Pass:** Let Uplimit AI score using rubric, focus instructor time on validating scores and providing personalized feedback
2. **Criterion-Focused Review:** Read memo once, score all criteria simultaneously (not 8 separate passes)
3. **Feedback Templates:** Create bank of common feedback phrases for each criterion tier, customize as needed
4. **Batch Grading:** Grade all memos for one criterion at a time to maintain consistency (e.g., grade all CLO 1 scores first, then all CLO 2, etc.)

**Estimated Grading Time per Memo:**
- AI scoring: 3-5 minutes (automated)
- Instructor review and adjustment: 15-20 minutes
- Personalized feedback: 5-10 minutes
- **Total: 20-30 minutes per memo**

**For 30-student cohort: 10-15 hours total grading time**

### Common Student Questions (FAQ to Post):

**Q: How long should my memo be?**
A: 1,500-2,000 words (6-8 pages). Longer is not better‚Äîconcise executive communication is valued.

**Q: Can I choose a property outside North America?**
A: Yes! European football clubs, international leagues, global events all work. Just ensure you can access enough data.

**Q: Do I need to apply ALL 5 weeks equally?**
A: Each CLO is worth 15 points, so yes‚Äîbalanced coverage across all 5 weeks is important. Don't neglect any week.

**Q: Can I use AI tools to help write my memo?**
A: You may use AI for brainstorming, outlining, and feedback (like the AI Chat Widget in this module), but the final written content must be your own work. Do not copy-paste AI-generated text.

**Q: What if my chosen property doesn't have public financial data?**
A: Make reasonable estimates based on comparable properties and clearly state your assumptions. Rationale matters more than perfect precision.

**Q: Can I exceed 2,000 words?**
A: No. Part of executive communication is conciseness. If you exceed 2,000 words, you'll lose points on Criterion 8.

**Q: How many citations do I need?**
A: Minimum 5 citations from course content (cases, executive sessions, readings). More is fine if relevant.
