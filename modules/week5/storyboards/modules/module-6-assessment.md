## Element 1: Connecting Introduction

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Text** element
2. Copy markdown below:

```markdown
## Make Your Call

In Module 5, you explored the Hockey Hall of Fame's strategic dilemma:
- Watched the video on the two traps to avoid
- Compared the three scenarios (Preserve, Transform, Hybrid)
- Used the Heritage Strategy Decision Tool to test different priorities
- Saw how each path affects different stakeholders

Now make your recommendation. No fence-sitting—pick a path and defend it.
```

## Element 2: Infobox - Assessment Overview

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Infobox** element
2. Choose variant: **Assessment** (purple)
3. Copy markdown below:

```markdown
Title: ▪ Assessment: HHOF Strategic Recommendation (25 points)

**Your Task:** In 300 words or less, recommend ONE strategic path for HHOF and defend your choice.

**Your recommendation must include:**

1. **Your Choice** - Preserve, Transform, or Hybrid (pick ONE)
2. **Why This Path** - What makes it better than the alternatives?
3. **The Trade-off** - What are you sacrificing by NOT choosing the other paths?
4. **One Key Risk** - What could go wrong, and how would you mitigate it?

**Grading (25 points):**
- Clear recommendation with reasoning (10 pts)
- Trade-off acknowledgment (8 pts)
- Risk awareness (7 pts)

**Tip:** Reference the scenario comparison table and stakeholder impact table from Module 5. Specific numbers beat vague claims.
```

## Element 3: Text Response - Strategic Recommendation

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Exercise → Text Response Question**
2. Configure the following fields:

**Question:**
```
What strategic path should the Hockey Hall of Fame pursue? Make your recommendation in 300 words or less.
```

**Additional Instructions:**
```
Your response will be evaluated on:

**Clear Recommendation (10 pts)**
- Commits to ONE path (Preserve/Transform/Hybrid)
- Explains why this path fits HHOF's situation
- Uses specific data (e.g., "$35M target," "8/12 curators," "89% donor retention")

**Trade-off Acknowledgment (8 pts)**
- Names what you're giving up by not choosing alternatives
- Shows you understand the downsides of your choice
- Demonstrates strategic thinking, not just cheerleading

**Risk Awareness (7 pts)**
- Identifies at least one meaningful risk
- Proposes how to mitigate or monitor it
- Shows realistic thinking about implementation

**Reference the Module 5 tables:**
- Three Scenarios table (revenue, capital, debt, goal achievement)
- Stakeholder Impact table (who wins/loses in each scenario)
```

**AI Feedback Prompt:**
```
Evaluate this HHOF strategic recommendation. Check for:
1. Did they commit to ONE clear path (not hedging)?
2. Did they reference specific numbers from the scenario tables?
3. Did they acknowledge trade-offs (what they're giving up)?
4. Did they identify a real risk and mitigation?

Provide brief, encouraging feedback. If they hedged or were vague, ask them to commit more clearly.
```

**Rubric Configuration:**

---

**CRITERION 1: Clear Recommendation**

**Points:** 10

**Does not meet expectations (0-3 pts):**
Recommendation is unclear, hedges between options, or doesn't commit to a path. No specific reasoning or data cited.

**Partially meets expectations (4-6 pts):**
Makes a recommendation but reasoning is generic. May cite some data but doesn't connect it to the argument. Could apply to any heritage property.

**Fully meets expectations (7-10 pts):**
Clearly commits to ONE path with HHOF-specific reasoning. Cites specific data (revenue targets, stakeholder percentages, capital requirements). Explains why this path fits HHOF's unique situation.

---

**CRITERION 2: Trade-off Acknowledgment**

**Points:** 8

**Does not meet expectations (0-2 pts):**
No mention of trade-offs. Presents chosen path as having no downsides. One-sided argument.

**Partially meets expectations (3-5 pts):**
Mentions trade-offs but superficially. May acknowledge one downside but not systematically compare to alternatives.

**Fully meets expectations (6-8 pts):**
Explicitly names what's being sacrificed. Example: "By choosing Hybrid over Transform, we cap growth at $35M instead of $42M, but we avoid $10M debt risk and curator resignations." Shows mature strategic thinking.

---

**CRITERION 3: Risk Awareness**

**Points:** 7

**Does not meet expectations (0-2 pts):**
No risks identified. Assumes the chosen path will work perfectly. No contingency thinking.

**Partially meets expectations (3-4 pts):**
Identifies a risk but vaguely. May not propose mitigation or monitoring approach.

**Fully meets expectations (5-7 pts):**
Identifies a specific, meaningful risk (e.g., "If digital membership adoption is slower than projected, we may miss the $35M target"). Proposes realistic mitigation (e.g., "We'd monitor Year 2 subscriber numbers and pivot to enhanced in-person premium experiences if below 8K").

## Element 4: Infobox - What's Next

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Infobox** element
2. Choose variant: **Next Steps** (green)
3. Copy markdown below:

```
Title: ✓ What's Next: Module 7

**After submitting your recommendation:**

Module 7 wraps up Week 5 with key takeaways and your CFL Expansion Final Proposal (Milestone 5). You'll synthesize everything you've learned across all five weeks into a comprehensive expansion proposal.

**Coming Up:**
- Week 5 Key Takeaways (5 critical insights)
- CFL Expansion Milestone 5: Final Expansion Proposal (40 points)
- Course Completion & Celebration

Submit your HHOF recommendation, then continue to Module 7.
```

## Instructor Notes

**Module 6 Purpose:**
- Assess Week 5 learning through strategic recommendation
- Lighter assessment aligned with simplified Module 5 exploration
- Clean handoff to Module 7 (CFL Expansion final proposal)

**Assessment Flow (Simplified Modules 5-6):**
1. Module 5: Students explore HHOF dilemma through video, tables, and decision tool (~20 min)
2. Module 6: Students write 300-word recommendation defending their choice (25 pts)

**Why Lighter Assessment:**
- Simplified Module 5 is ~20 minutes of exploration, not 90+ minutes of case analysis
- Assessment should match the learning investment
- 300 words is enough to demonstrate strategic thinking without requiring deep case knowledge
- Students who want to go deeper can read the optional case background in Module 5

**For Students Who Want More Challenge:**
Students who read the full case background (Module 5 accordion) can reference the detailed exhibits in their response. This isn't required but will strengthen their arguments.

**Grading Notes:**
- Look for clear commitment to ONE path (not "it depends" or "all three have merit")
- Trade-off acknowledgment is the key differentiator between surface and deep responses
- Accept any of the three paths if well-defended—there's no "right answer"
- Specific numbers from the tables beat vague generalizations

**Alternative Formats:**
- Students can also submit a screenshot of their Heritage Strategy Decision Tool results with a brief explanation
- Video response (90 seconds) acceptable for accessibility
