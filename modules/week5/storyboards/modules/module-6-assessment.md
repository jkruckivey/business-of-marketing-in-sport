## Element 1: Connecting Introduction

**Uplimit Implementation:**

2. Copy markdown below:

```markdown
## What Did You Learn?

You've explored heritage property strategy from multiple angles:
- **Module 3:** The Legacy vs Innovation Matrix and Future Trends frameworks
- **Module 4:** HHOF's strategic dilemma—$35M target, three paths, stakeholder tensions
- **Module 5:** Tested your own strategy in the simulation and defended your choices

Before moving to your CFL Expansion Final Proposal, capture your key insight. What will you take forward?
```

## Element 2: Text Response - Heritage Strategy Reflection

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Exercise → Text Response Question**
2. Configure the following fields:

**Question:**
```
What's your biggest takeaway from the HHOF case and simulation? In 200 words or less, describe one insight you'll apply to your CFL Expansion Final Proposal.
```

**Additional Instructions:**
```
This is a reflection, not a graded assessment. Capture your thinking.

Consider:
- What surprised you about balancing heritage preservation with revenue growth?
- What happened in your simulation that you didn't expect?
- How does the HHOF dilemma connect to your CFL expansion strategy?

Be specific. "Heritage matters" is vague. "I learned that aggressive digital transformation can alienate core stakeholders—8/12 curators would resign under Transform—so my CFL proposal will include stakeholder guardrails" shows applied thinking.
```

**AI Feedback Prompt:**
```
This is an ungraded reflection. Provide brief, encouraging feedback:
- Acknowledge their insight
- If they connected it to their CFL proposal, note that positively
- If vague, gently ask what specific moment or data point led to that insight

Keep feedback to 2-3 sentences. This prepares them for the final proposal.
```

## Instructor Notes

**Module 6 Purpose:**
- Brief reflection to consolidate learning before final proposal
- Ungraded—captures thinking without assessment pressure
- Clean handoff to Module 7 (CFL Expansion final proposal)

**Module Flow (4-5-6):**
1. Module 4: HHOF context—video, scenario tables, stakeholder impacts (~10-15 min)
2. Module 5: Apply context using Heritage Transformation Strategist + defend choices (~20-25 min)
3. Module 6: Ungraded reflection (~5 min)

**Why Ungraded:**
- Students already defended their strategy in Module 5 roleplay
- Reflection captures insight without adding assessment burden
- Final proposal in Module 7 is the major graded deliverable for Week 5
- Reduces cognitive load before capstone

**Total Time Estimate:**
- Reflection writing: 5 minutes
- **Total Module 6 time: ~5 minutes**
