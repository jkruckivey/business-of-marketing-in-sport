## From Reading to Strategic Analysis

You've read the Hockey Hall of Fame case (Module 5) and understand the strategic situation. You know HHOF's heritage strengths, attendance challenges, and three transformation scenarios:
- **PRESERVE:** +17% growth, low risk, misses board target
- **TRANSFORM:** +135% growth, high risk, achieves $42.6M revenue but threatens authenticity
- **HYBRID:** +94% growth, moderate risk, hits $35M target with heritage preservation

Now it's time to analyze. Which scenario should HHOF choose? What are the real trade-offs? How do stakeholders respond? What constraints limit execution?

**Module 6 Focus: Analysis & Decision**

In this module, you'll complete your case analysis:
- **Part 3:** The Strategic Dilemma (explicit trade-off comparison across scenarios)
- **Part 4:** Real-World Constraints & Complexity (stakeholder landscape, financing, talent gaps)
- **Part 5:** Implications for the Future (10-15 year scenarios for each path)
- **Exhibit B:** Detailed financial projections (NPV, break-even, risk scenarios)
- **Exhibit C:** Stakeholder perspectives (curators, donors, board, fans)
- **Discussion Questions:** Guided analysis using WLOs 5.1-5.4
- **AI Roleplay:** Defend your recommendation to HHOF Board of Governors

**Your Task:** Analyze the case systematically, evaluate all three scenarios, and defend a strategic recommendation. Use frameworks from Modules 3-4 (Legacy vs Innovation Matrix, stakeholder analysis) to structure your thinking.

**Reminder on Financial Figures:** This case uses modeled financial projections. Actual HHOF revenue is approximately $10-11 million annually; the case scenarios use an illustrative baseline of ~$18M. Focus on the *relative* trade-offs and growth percentages rather than absolute dollar figures.

## Element 2: Case Study Analysis (Parts 3-5)

### PART 3: THE STRATEGIC DILEMMA

Each scenario involves explicit trade-offs:

| Factor | PRESERVE | TRANSFORM | HYBRID |
|---|---|---|---|
| Revenue Growth | +17% ($21.2M) | +135% ($42.6M) | +94% ($35.1M) |
| Heritage Authenticity | ✅ Preserved | ❌ At Risk | ✅ Protected |
| Donor Credibility | ✅ Strong | ❌ Weakened | ✅ Maintained |
| Curatorial Team | ✅ Retained | ❌ Departures | ✅ Retained |
| Innovation Appeal | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Extensive | ✅ Balanced |
| Operational Complexity | ✅ Low | ❌ Extreme | ◐ Moderate |
| International Reach | ✅ None | ✅✅ Extensive | ◐ Selective |
| Achieves Board Goal ($35M+) | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Risk Profile | Low | High | Moderate |

**The Core Tension:**

HHOF can maximize revenue growth ($42.6M in Transform scenario) by abandoning heritage constraints. But this path erodes the credibility that MAKES heritage valuable in the first place. A "heritage institution" that prioritizes betting partnerships and algorithmic personalization has won revenue but lost identity.

Conversely, preserving heritage perfectly ($21M in Preserve scenario) fails the board's strategic mandate and accelerates decline among younger audiences. In 10 years, HHOF risks becoming a niche curiosity—prestigious but irrelevant.

The Hybrid scenario requires discipline: Growing revenue while making strategic choices about which innovations enhance heritage mission and which compromise it. This is harder than pure growth or pure preservation—it requires saying "yes" and "no" to different opportunities, rather than "yes to all growth" or "no to all change."

---

### PART 4: REAL-WORLD CONSTRAINTS & COMPLEXITY

#### Stakeholder Landscape

**The Board:** Divided. Heritage advocates (Bronfman family, Hall of Fame alumni) prefer Preserve/Hybrid. Corporate sponsors (Scotiabank) want Hybrid/Transform growth. NHL executives see Transform as competitive advantage for media rights value.

**The Curatorial Staff:** Core strength of HHOF. 12 senior curators with 20-30 year tenure and deep hockey knowledge. They will actively resist Transform scenario (some have already informally stated they would resign). They're cautiously supportive of Hybrid with strong guardrails.

**The Donor Base:** $2.1M annual from individual and corporate donors. These are alumni, former players, corporate sponsors who donate BECAUSE HHOF preserves hockey's legacy. Transform scenario risks $4M+ in donor defections (30% loss).

**The Younger Audience (18-35):** HHOF's growth opportunity. They want immersive experiences, digital integration, and contemporary relevance. But they also expect authenticity—they're skeptical of corporate tokenism. A Transform scenario risks feeling inauthentic.

**The International Market:** Significant opportunity (43% of pre-COVID visitors were international). Pop-ups in emerging markets (Shanghai, Mumbai) could reach fans who'll never travel to Toronto. But logistics, cultural translation, and curatorial control are complex.

#### Financial Reality Check

HHOF has $5.2M in liquid reserves (3.3 months operating budget). Capital investments proposed:

- Preserve: $2.1M (18 months of operating budget)
- Hybrid: $6.8M (4.5 months of operating budget)
- Transform: $15.2M (10+ months of operating budget)

For Transform, HHOF would need external financing (bank loan, board capital calls, private equity). This adds debt service (~$900K annually), which eats into projected margins.

For Hybrid, HHOF can self-fund through combination of reserves + operating income + selective fundraising. Lower financial risk.

#### Talent & Capability

**Gap 1 - Digital Talent:** HHOF employs 0 software engineers, 0 VR specialists, 0 data scientists. Transform scenario requires hiring 8-12 tech staff over 2 years. Cost: $1.2M annually. Competitive landscape (Amazon, Google in Toronto) makes hiring difficult.

**Gap 2 - International Operations:** HHOF has no experience running pop-ups, managing international logistics, or navigating international sponsorships. Transform scenario requires hiring International Director + regional coordinators. Learning curve: 2-3 years.

**Gap 3 - Digital Marketing & Brand:** HHOF's marketing is traditional (PR, annual events, word-of-mouth). Competing for younger audiences requires social media expertise, influencer partnerships, and data-driven marketing. Current marketing budget: $240K/year (1.3% of revenue).

---

### PART 5: IMPLICATIONS FOR THE FUTURE

#### If HHOF Chooses PRESERVE:
HHOF remains a prestigious but slowly declining institution. 15 years from now, HHOF serves a loyal base of 200,000 annual visitors. Revenues plateau at $22-24M. The institution becomes financially stable but culturally irrelevant to anyone under 40. Risk: Gradual obsolescence, loss of NHL partnership leverage as league evaluates newer, more innovative heritage experiences.

#### If HHOF Chooses TRANSFORM:
HHOF becomes a technology-forward experience destination, possibly rivaling major science museums and theme parks. 15 years from now, HHOF attracts 800,000+ annual visitors globally. Revenues exceed $50M. But the institution has shed its curatorial foundation. It's still called "Hockey Hall of Fame," but 60%+ of revenue comes from entertainment and data services unrelated to hockey heritage. Risk: Loss of credibility with donors, curatorial community, and hockey traditionalists. Potential backlash: "HHOF sold out."

#### If HHOF Chooses HYBRID:
HHOF grows to a sustainable $35-40M revenue institution while maintaining heritage authenticity and curatorial integrity. 15 years from now, HHOF attracts 450,000 annual visitors (30% increase) with strong domestic and emerging international reach. Digital membership generates recurring revenue (predictable, lower churn than admissions). The institution innovates strategically—enhancing heritage experience rather than replacing it. Risk: Hybrid is harder to execute than pure strategies (requires discipline and trade-off decisions). Also faces risk: Does growth plateau at $35M, or does hybrid path enable further expansion once foundation is stable?

## Break-Even Analysis

**What attendance/engagement is needed to break even in each scenario?**

**Transform Scenario Break-Even:**
- VR needs 320,000 annual visitors @ $19.50 to break even (currently projected 400K)
- Pop-ups need 85,000 annual visitors @ $45 average (currently projected 182,000)
- If international tourism doesn't rebound 10%+ annually, margin pressure immediate

**Hybrid Scenario Break-Even:**
- Digital membership needs 12,000 subscribers @ $14.99/month (currently projected 16K)
- Toronto admissions need growth to $8.2M (currently on track)
- Pop-ups need 45,000 annual visitors @ $47 average (lower execution risk than Transform)
- More sustainable if ANY component underperforms

---

## Long-Term Financial Trajectory (10-Year View)

### PRESERVE Scenario
- 2024: $18.1M
- 2029: $21.2M
- 2034: $23.8M (assuming modest 2% annual growth)
- **Trajectory:** Slow, stable, declining relevance to younger audiences

### TRANSFORM Scenario
- 2024: $18.1M
- 2029: $42.6M (if all projections hit)
- 2034: $58M+ (scaling digital and pop-ups)
- **Trajectory:** Steep growth, high execution dependency, significant organizational change

### HYBRID Scenario
- 2024: $18.1M
- 2029: $35.1M
- 2034: $48-52M (continued measured growth + reinvestment)
- **Trajectory:** Moderate growth, sustainable, foundation for future expansion

**Key Question:** Does Hybrid's foundation enable further growth after 2029, or does it plateau? Analysis suggests that once digital platform and pop-up infrastructure are established, scaling becomes lower-cost, allowing for future international expansion similar to Transform—but with heritage guardrails intact.

## Element 7: Details - Exhibit C

**Title:** Exhibit C: Stakeholder Perspectives (Qualitative Input)


[Expand for stakeholder insights]

## CURATORS (Senior Exhibition & Collections Staff, n=12)

### Quoted Perspectives:

**Dr. James Chen, Senior Curator (20-year tenure):**
> "The question isn't whether we should digitize—of course we should. The question is: Do we serve hockey history or serve a business model that happens to use hockey as content? Transform feels like we're choosing the latter. Hybrid respects both."

**Elena Rodriguez, Director of Exhibitions:**
> "If we go full digital with VR and international pop-ups, we lose something irreplaceable: the intimate relationship between artifacts and visitors. You don't experience the Stanley Cup the same way in a VR simulation. That authenticity is our competitive advantage."

**Survey Response (Anonymous, 8/12 curators):**
> "Comfortable with Hybrid if curatorial guardrails are legally binding. Preserve is safer but misses market opportunity. Transform is a dealbreaker—we'll resign."

### Curator Consensus on Scenarios:
- **PRESERVE:** 3/12 prefer (risk-averse curators, near retirement)
- **TRANSFORM:** 0/12 support (8/12 state explicitly they would resign)
- **HYBRID:** 7/12 strongly support (if guardrails are enforcement)
- **Undecided:** 2/12 (willing to see governance model)

---

## BOARD OF GOVERNORS (Major Strategic Voice)

### Heritage Advocates (Pro-Preservation Voices)

**Charles Bronfman (Honorary Chair, Saputo Family):**
> "HHOF's value isn't economic—it's cultural. If we become just another entertainment venue, we've failed our mission. I'd rather grow 15% sustainably than 135% by abandoning who we are."

**Kevin Lowe (Former Edmonton Oilers, Inductee, Board Member):**
> "The players who built this game—Gretzky, Crosby, the women who fought for recognition—they expect HHOF to be a sanctuary for their legacy, not a corporate amusement park. That matters to us."

### Growth Advocates (Pro-Innovation Voices)

**Michael Crawley (Scotiabank, Title Sponsor):**
> "Sponsorship value is declining because HHOF's audience is aging and shrinking. We're not buying into tradition—we're buying into a growth platform. Hybrid might work if margins are strong."

**NHL Senior Executive (Anonymous Board Member):**
> "If HHOF doesn't modernize aggressively, the league will create a competing heritage property. We need you competitive. Transform is the only scenario that's defensible."

### Compromise Position (Hybrid Support)

**Board Consensus on Hybrid:**
- Achieves board's stated $35M goal
- Preserves heritage through guardrails
- Sustainable financial model (no external debt)
- Allows for future expansion
- **Board vote (preliminary):** 7/11 board members support Hybrid as path forward

---

## DONORS & PHILANTHROPIC COMMUNITY (Annual contribution: $2.1M)

### Heritage Foundation Leaders

**Dr. Richard Robertson, Founder, Robertson Family Foundation:**
> "We've donated $3M to HHOF over 15 years because it's one of Canada's trustworthy institutions. If you became just like other entertainment venues, we'd redirect that money to sports scholarship programs instead. Don't lose us."

### Corporate Sponsorship Perspective

**Scotiabank Sponsorship Committee:**
> "We committed $2.8M annually to title sponsorship based on audience growth expectations. Preserve scenario doesn't meet those. Hybrid is acceptable if digital metrics show strong engagement."

### Survey Results (Donor Sentiment, n=47 major donors)

| Question | PRESERVE | TRANSFORM | HYBRID |
|---|---|---|---|
| "Would you continue support?" | 94% yes | 47% yes | 89% yes |
| "Confident in leadership?" | 78% yes | 23% yes | 71% yes |
| "Would you increase/decrease giving?" | 62% increase | 74% decrease | 58% increase |

**Donor Risk Analysis:**
- **Transform scenario risk:** $800K-$1.2M annual donor loss (estimated 15-25% attrition)
- **Hybrid scenario risk:** $150K-$300K annual donor loss (estimated 3-7% attrition, manageable)
- **Preserve scenario:** Minimal risk to base donors (but misses younger audiences)

---

## YOUNGER VISITORS (18-35 Age Group, Qualitative Research, n=23)

### Quote Sampling

**Sarah, 24, University of Toronto Student (First-Time Visitor):**
> "I came because my grandpa insisted, and I'm glad I did. But if I were choosing how to spend Saturday with friends, I'd go somewhere with more interactive stuff. It felt like a museum from the 90s."

**Jamal, 19, Toronto Highschool Student:**
> "Cool if they had VR hockey games and AR stuff. Right now it's just looking at jerseys behind glass. My phone camera could do that."

**Marcus, 31, Software Engineer:**
> "Hybrid is smart. VR for the sake of VR feels gimmicky. But showing how modern analytics changed the game, or letting me explore player stats interactively? That's value."

### Survey Response (Younger Visitors Who Selected PRESERVE vs. HYBRID)

| Opinion | PRESERVE | HYBRID | TRANSFORM |
|---|---|---|---|
| "Would recommend to friends?" | 42% yes | 71% yes | 68% yes* |
| "Price ($25) fair for experience?" | 31% yes | 62% yes | Would depend on features |
| "Likely to return?" | 15% yes | 41% yes | Would depend |
| "Digital membership appeals?" | 8% interested | 45% interested | 72% interested |

*Transform scored high on appeal but high on skepticism: "Sounds cool but seems risky" sentiment

### Younger Audience Insight:
- **Preserve:** Misses market opportunity; unlikely to attract repeat younger visitors
- **Hybrid:** Sweet spot—innovation that respects heritage, affordable digital options
- **Transform:** High appeal but concerning authenticity risk ("feels like a theme park")

---

## STAFF (Non-Curatorial, n=65 FTE)

### Sentiment Survey (Anonymous)

**Job Security Concern by Scenario:**
- Preserve: 72% feel secure (minimal organizational change)
- Hybrid: 58% feel secure (some reorganization, new skills needed)
- Transform: 31% feel secure (significant reorganization, unfamiliar tech roles)

**Learning & Development Opportunity:**
- Preserve: 21% see growth opportunity
- Hybrid: 64% see development opportunity (digital skills, new programs)
- Transform: 81% see opportunity but 59% fear skills gap (will they be retained?)

**Free-Response Quote (Anonymous Operations Staff):**
> "I've worked here 12 years because it's a good place. Preserve or Hybrid, I feel respected. Transform feels like we're hiring totally different people and moving on from us."

## INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCES (Market Opportunity Research)

### Pop-Up Market Research (Shanghai, Mumbai, Mexico City)

**Shanghai (Tier 1 Chinese Market):**
- Ice hockey participation growing 12% annually (Winter Olympics effect)
- Young, wealthy audience interested in international sports history
- Estimated market: 35,000 potential annual visitors to pop-up
- Price sensitivity: Would accept $28-32 admission
- **Viability:** High (strong market pull)

**Mumbai (Emerging Market):**
- Ice hockey niche but growing interest (Winter Sports initiatives)
- Estimated market: 8,000-12,000 potential annual visitors to pop-up
- Price sensitivity: $12-15 admission
- **Viability:** Moderate (requires subsidization or local sponsorship)

**Mexico City (Sports-Enthusiast Market):**
- Growing hockey interest; Mexican players in NHL (Vazquez, etc.)
- Estimated market: 18,000-25,000 potential annual visitors
- Price sensitivity: $18-22 admission
- **Viability:** Good (local hockey pride factor)

**Overall Conclusion:**
Transform's international revenue projections ($8.2M annually from 3 simultaneous pop-ups) are aggressive. Hybrid's conservative domestic approach ($2.1M from 1 pop-up per year) is more achievable but leaves significant opportunity untapped.

---

## COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

### Museums Pursuing Digital Transformation

**The Met (New York):**
- Digital membership: 250K+ members
- Virtual exhibitions reaching 50M+ annually
- Physical attendance: Still 5.5M+ (digital enhanced, not replaced physical)
- **Lesson:** Digital complements physical; highest success when both integrate

**National WWI Museum (Kansas City):**
- VR experiences (trench simulation): Popular but limited to 3% of annual visitors
- Digital focus: 40% of budget but only 12% of revenue
- **Lesson:** VR as novelty needs strong supporting authentic content

**Olympic Museum (Lausanne):**
- Digital membership: 8% of revenue ($2M)
- Conservative growth model similar to HHOF's Hybrid
- **Trajectory:** Growing sustainably; competitive with international museums

**Lesson from Competitive Set:**
- Digital integration is necessary (all major museums doing it)
- Digital as entertainment gimmick fails long-term (VR without content doesn't scale)
- Hybrid model (physical + digital + selective expansion) is industry standard for heritage success

## Element 8: Case Discussion Questions

### Questions for Analysis (Aligned to WLOs 5.1-5.4)

**WLO 5.1: Evaluate heritage properties as revenue assets**

1. What financial data reveals HHOF's fundamental challenge? Which revenue streams are growth drivers, and which are declining? How does HHOF's revenue model differ from for-profit entertainment venues?

2. Compare HHOF's financial position (Exhibit A) to heritage property benchmarks (Element 4). What does HHOF do better? Where is it vulnerable?

3. In the Preserve scenario, could HHOF sustain operations indefinitely at $21.2M revenue with 12-14% margins? What happens to the institution in 15 years?

---

**WLO 5.2: Design strategies balancing tradition preservation with innovation**

4. What stakeholder interests create tension in the Transform scenario? Identify at least three groups who would be dissatisfied with aggressive digital transformation. What would you lose if they withdrew support?

5. Hybrid scenario includes "Curatorial Guardrails" (Exhibit B): Senior curators veto mission-diluting initiatives. Is this workable governance, or does it create decision paralysis? How would you operationalize guardrails?

6. If you were advising HHOF's board, which scenario best balances heritage preservation with revenue growth? Justify with reference to financial data (Exhibit B) and stakeholder impact (Exhibit C).

---

**WLO 5.3: Assess future trends impacting heritage sports properties**

7. What long-term trends (5-10 year view) favor each scenario? Consider: younger audience preferences, digital entertainment evolution, international tourism recovery, sports media consolidation.

8. Transform scenario projects $7.8M annual revenue from VR experiences (assuming 400K annual visitors @ $19.50). What assumptions must hold true for this to succeed? If younger audiences prioritize "authentic experience" over "technological novelty," does VR demand collapse?

9. Hybrid's pop-up strategy (one domestic pop-up per year) is conservative compared to Transform's international expansion. How much future revenue growth opportunity is HHOF sacrificing with this choice? Is it the right trade-off?

---

**WLO 5.4: Create 5-year strategic vision integrating Week 1-5 frameworks**

10. **Integration Question:** Using frameworks from all 5 weeks, build a 5-year strategic recommendation for HHOF:
    - **Week 1:** How do HHOF's revenue streams (admissions, events, retail, sponsorship) shift in your chosen scenario?
    - **Week 2:** How does media strategy evolve? (Streaming partnerships, content creation, digital membership)
    - **Week 3:** How do sponsorships and partnerships change? What new sponsorship opportunities emerge?
    - **Week 4:** How does athlete/heritage branding factor into your vision? (Inductee engagement, player legacy partnerships)
    - **Week 5:** How do you balance growth with heritage authenticity?

11. **Risk Mitigation:** Identify three critical risks to your chosen scenario (Exhibit B's Pessimistic Case or your own analysis). How would you mitigate each? What early warning indicators would trigger a strategy shift?

12. **Measurement & Accountability:** What metrics would you track annually to measure success? How would you know if your strategic choice was working within 2-3 years?

**Widget Status:** ⭕ Needs configuration in Uplimit platform

---

## UPLIMIT CONFIGURATION - AI Roleplay

**Step 1: Select "AI Roleplay Scenario" element in Uplimit builder**

**Step 2: Set Learning Objective**

Choose: **"Add objective myself"**

Copy this into the **Objective** field:


Students will present a strategic recommendation for Hockey Hall of Fame's 5-year vision by analyzing heritage property revenue models, evaluating stakeholder perspectives, and defending their chosen strategy (Preserve/Transform/Hybrid) with reference to case data and competitive benchmarks. (WLOs 5.1-5.4 - Evaluation & Synthesis level)


**Step 3: Create Scenario**

Choose: **"Create your own scenario"**

Copy this into the **Scenario Context** field:


You are presenting to the Hockey Hall of Fame Board of Governors' Strategic Planning Committee. The board has asked for your recommendation on HHOF's 5-year vision: Should they pursue the PRESERVE strategy (stable, low-risk, modest growth), TRANSFORM strategy (aggressive digital-first growth), or HYBRID strategy (balanced evolution)?

The board is divided. Charles Bronfman (heritage advocate) worries about mission creep. Michael Crawley (Scotiabank sponsor) wants revenue growth. The broader board is skeptical of any path that requires heavy external financing or risks losing curatorial leadership.

Your role: Present a clear, data-driven recommendation that acknowledges the trade-offs involved. You'll defend your choice against tough questions from board members with different priorities.

Conversation structure: Board members will ask 5 questions to pressure-test your strategic thinking and ensure your recommendation is realistic.

You are the Board of Governors' Strategic Planning Committee moderator, representing diverse board interests: heritage preservation (Charles Bronfman voice), revenue growth (Michael Crawley voice), stakeholder management (Kevin Lowe voice), and financial prudence (CFO voice).

Your personality:
- Pragmatic: You respect data-driven arguments backed by exhibits
- Skeptical: You've seen many heritage institutions fail by chasing growth and losing mission
- Growth-oriented: You know HHOF can't stay flat—decline is the alternative
- Stakeholder-focused: You care about donor confidence, curatorial retention, and board unity

Your conversation strategy:

Ask 5 questions to test the student's strategic thinking:

1. **Opening Challenge:** "Walk us through your recommendation and the key trade-offs you're making. What's at stake with your chosen path?"
   - Test if they understand implications of their choice

2. **Heritage Risk:** "Your scenario involves [specific changes]. How do you mitigate the risk that we lose curatorial credibility or donor support?"
   - Probe for stakeholder awareness and risk mitigation

3. **Financial Reality Check:** "Your revenue projections assume [key assumption]. What happens if that assumption doesn't hold? Do we have a backup plan?"
   - Demand scenario planning and financial contingency thinking

4. **Competitive Pressure:** "Other sports museums are pursuing [Transform-like] strategies. Aren't we falling behind by being too cautious?"
   - Force them to justify a potentially conservative choice against competitive pressure

5. **Implementation & Accountability:** "Assuming the board approves your recommendation, how would you know within 2-3 years if it was the right choice? What metrics matter most?"
   - Test if they've thought through execution and measurement

After these 5 questions, provide rubric-aligned feedback on their performance.


Copy this into the **Student Role** field:


You are a strategic consultant presenting to the HHOF Board's Strategic Planning Committee. Based on your case analysis, you're recommending one of three paths: PRESERVE, TRANSFORM, or HYBRID. Defend your recommendation using case data.

**Step 4: Hidden Context (AI-only information)**

Copy this into the **Hidden Context** field:


**AI Character Context:**
You're moderating a board meeting where a consultant is presenting the Hockey Hall of Fame's 5-year strategic options. The student has analyzed three scenarios (Preserve, Transform, Hybrid) with financial projections, stakeholder impacts, and competitive benchmarks.

**Your Job:** Push back on assumptions, demand evidence, test whether they've thought through unintended consequences.

**Stakeholder Perspectives to Reference (if they ignore them):**
- Heritage perspective: Curators will resign if mission is compromised (8/12 curators stated this explicitly in Exhibit C)
- Donor perspective: $800K-$1.2M potential loss in Transform scenario (47% of major donors would reduce support)
- Financial perspective: Transform requires $10M external financing with $900K annual debt service burden
- Growth perspective: Preserve scenario fails to achieve $35M board goal; may signal institutional decline to sponsors

**What Strong Performance Looks Like:**
- ✅ Clear recommendation with explicit rationale (not waffling)
- ✅ Uses case data: "Exhibit A shows admissions declined 22% since 2019, suggesting..."
- ✅ Acknowledges trade-offs: "Transform grows revenue but risks $1.2M donor loss and potential curator departures..."
- ✅ Addresses financing: "Our recommended scenario requires $6.8M capital investment—here's how we fund it without damaging balance sheet..."
- ✅ Stakeholder awareness: "We're protecting heritage through [specific guardrails/mechanisms] while investing in growth..."
- ✅ Measurement discipline: "We'll measure success through [specific metrics] and will pivot if Year 2 data shows [specific conditions]..."

**Conversation Objectives (5 questions):**
1. Test understanding of strategic implications (what's at stake with their choice)
2. Probe risk mitigation (how they address heritage/stakeholder risk)
3. Pressure-test financial assumptions (what if X doesn't happen?)
4. Challenge competitive positioning (justify choice vs. market pressures)
5. Assess execution discipline (how will you measure success and adapt?)

**After completing 5 questions:** Provide rubric-aligned feedback using the 4 criteria defined below.

**Step 5: Configure Feedback Rubric**

**Add/Edit these criteria:**

---

**CRITERION 1: Strategic Analysis & Recommendation Clarity**

**Points:** 15

**Description:**
Student makes a clear, defensible strategic recommendation (Preserve/Transform/Hybrid) supported by explicit reasoning about financial trade-offs and organizational constraints.

**Does not meet expectations:**
The student's recommendation is unclear, waffles between options, or lacks coherent rationale. Strategic implications are not articulated.

**Partially meets expectations:**
The student makes a recommendation but the reasoning is incomplete. Some key trade-offs are mentioned but not systematically analyzed. Lacks reference to specific scenarios or constraints.

**Fully meets expectations:**
The student clearly recommends ONE path and explains why it's superior to alternatives. Explicitly addresses financial trade-offs, stakeholder impacts, and organizational constraints (debt burden, capability gaps, execution risk). Uses scenario analysis (base case, optimistic, pessimistic) to justify the recommendation.

---

**CRITERION 2: Use of Case Data & Evidence**

**Points:** 12

**Description:**
Student references specific exhibits and financial data to support their recommendation.

**Does not meet expectations:**
Student provides minimal or no reference to case data. Relies on generalizations or opinions not grounded in exhibits.

**Partially meets expectations:**
Student mentions exhibits (A, B, C) but with limited specificity. May cite some numbers but doesn't connect them strategically to the recommendation.

**Fully meets expectations:**
Student cites specific data points from exhibits: attendance trends (Exhibit A), revenue projections (Exhibit B), stakeholder sentiment (Exhibit C). Connects data to strategic implications. Example: "Exhibit C shows 47% of major donors would reduce support in Transform scenario, representing $800K-$1.2M annual loss, which is why I'm recommending Hybrid instead..."

---

**CRITERION 3: Stakeholder Awareness & Risk Mitigation**

**Points:** 10

**Description:**
Student acknowledges competing stakeholder interests and demonstrates how their recommended strategy mitigates key risks.

**Does not meet expectations:**
Student shows minimal stakeholder awareness. Risk mitigation is not addressed or is naive (assumes tensions will resolve without intervention).

**Partially meets expectations:**
Student recognizes some stakeholder tensions (e.g., donors vs. growth advocates) but only superficially addresses risk mitigation. May overlook critical groups (curators, international market).

**Fully meets expectations:**
Student identifies multiple stakeholder perspectives explicitly (curators, donors, younger audiences, board growth advocates, international markets). For each relevant group, student explains how their recommended strategy either protects or mitigates their concerns. Example: "Hybrid protects curatorial integrity through binding guardrails, reducing resignation risk. It grows revenue enough to satisfy sponsors while avoiding donor alienation."

---

**CRITERION 4: Financial Discipline & Execution Thinking**

**Points:** 10

**Description:**
Student addresses financing requirements, demonstrates understanding of financial constraints, and proposes realistic execution metrics.

**Does not meet expectations:**
Student ignores financing requirements or assumes capital is unlimited. Offers no metrics for measuring success.

**Partially meets expectations:**
Student acknowledges capital requirements but doesn't fully address financing sources or contingencies. Vague on measurement ("we'll track revenue").

**Fully meets expectations:**
Student is specific about capital requirements: "Hybrid requires $6.8M over 5 years; we'll fund through $5.2M reserves + $1.6M board fundraising, avoiding external debt." Student proposes specific success metrics tied to their recommendation: "For Hybrid, we'll measure digital membership adoption (target 16K by Year 3), pop-up attendance (10K per event), and donor retention (>85%)."

### Your Task

You're a strategic consultant to the Hockey Hall of Fame Board. You've analyzed three strategic options: PRESERVE, TRANSFORM, and HYBRID. The board wants your recommendation—and they want you ready to defend it.

### What You Need to Know

**Case Knowledge:**
- Exhibit A: HHOF's revenue and attendance trends (declining admission, flat education programs)
- Exhibit B: Three scenarios with 5-year financial projections
- Exhibit C: Stakeholder perspectives (curators, donors, younger audiences, board members, staff)
- Element 4: Competitive benchmarks (Olympic Museum, MLB Hall of Fame, etc.)

**Your Analysis Should Cover:**
1. **Financial Case:** Which scenario best balances revenue growth with financial stability?
2. **Stakeholder Case:** How does your recommendation address curator retention, donor support, and board unity?
3. **Strategic Case:** Does your recommendation position HHOF for long-term competitiveness?
4. **Risk Case:** What could go wrong, and how would you respond?

### Your Goal

Present a clear, data-driven recommendation that:
1. Makes a specific choice (PRESERVE/TRANSFORM/HYBRID) with explicit reasoning
2. Defends that choice using case data and evidence
3. Addresses stakeholder impacts and risk mitigation
4. Demonstrates financial realism (capital requirements, financing sources, margins)
5. Proposes measurement approach (how you'll know if the strategy is working)

### Conversation Structure

The board will ask 5 tough questions:
1. **Opening:** Walk us through your recommendation and the key trade-offs
2. **Heritage Risk:** How do you mitigate risk to curatorial leadership and donor confidence?
3. **Financial Pressure:** What if your key assumptions don't hold?
4. **Competitive Challenge:** Aren't we falling behind other museums?
5. **Execution:** How will you measure success and know when to adapt?

Answer thoughtfully, using data to support your arguments.

### What Happens Next

After the roleplay, you'll receive rubric-aligned feedback on four criteria: Strategic Analysis (15 pts), Case Data Usage (12 pts), Stakeholder Awareness (10 pts), and Financial Discipline (10 pts). **Total: 47 points toward your Week 5 Case Analysis grade.**

**Pro Tip:** The board respects leaders who acknowledge trade-offs rather than promise win-win scenarios. You won't make everyone happy—your job is to explain why your choice is defensible.

## Module 5 Complete - Next Steps

**What You've Analyzed:**
You've examined a real heritage sports institution facing the classic strategic tension: preservation vs. growth. The Hockey Hall of Fame case revealed how revenue models work for cultural institutions, how stakeholder interests diverge, and why financial sustainability requires trade-off decisions that no single stakeholder will love perfectly.

**Key Takeaways from Module 5:**
- Heritage properties are valuable BECAUSE they preserve authenticity, yet that same authenticity can limit growth
- Revenue growth and mission preservation aren't automatically aligned—they require strategic discipline
- Stakeholder analysis reveals that "growth" benefits some groups (sponsors, younger audiences) while threatening others (donors, curators)
- Financial realism matters: Transform's aggressive growth requires $10M external financing with significant debt service burden
- The Hybrid model isn't compromise for weakness—it's strategic discipline about which innovations enhance vs. compromise heritage mission

**Up Next: Module 7 - Your Assessment**

You've learned the frameworks (Module 3), applied them strategically (Module 4), and analyzed real cases (Modules 5-6). Now it's time for your final assessment: a 5-year strategic vision memo that integrates everything you've learned across all 5 weeks. In Module 7, you'll choose your own sports property and create a comprehensive strategic plan—synthesizing revenue streams, media strategy, sponsorship models, athlete branding, and heritage/innovation considerations.
