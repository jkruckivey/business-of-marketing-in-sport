```
Title: ◉ Week 5 Key Takeaways

You've completed your deep dive into legacy, culture, and the future of sports business! The five critical insights: (1) heritage properties monetize nostalgia and tradition through experiences, not just artifacts—the Hockey Hall of Fame shows how to balance preservation with revenue generation, (2) legacy vs. innovation requires explicit trade-off analysis because you can't preserve everything while transforming—successful properties draw clear boundaries, (3) future trends including AI, VR/AR, sustainability, and global expansion will reshape sports business within the next decade, (4) cultural and social impact considerations are increasingly strategic decisions, not just PR—stakeholders expect authentic engagement, and (5) strategic synthesis means integrating all frameworks into a coherent vision where media, sponsorship, athlete brands, and legacy management reinforce each other. You've now mastered the complete sports business toolkit. Congratulations on completing this 5-week journey!

**Up Next:** CFL Expansion Milestone 5 (Final Proposal), then course completion.

1. Select **Text** element

## CFL Expansion Project: Milestone 5 - Final Expansion Proposal

This is it. You've spent four weeks developing your CFL expansion franchise: market analysis (Week 1), media strategy (Week 2), sponsorship portfolio (Week 3), and brand launch plan (Week 4). Now you'll synthesize everything into a comprehensive expansion proposal for the CFL Board of Governors.

**Your Challenge:** Create a board-ready expansion proposal that integrates Milestones 1-4 with financial projections, risk analysis, and a compelling 5-year vision.

**Why This Matters:** This is the real work sports executives do. Expansion proposals aren't academic exercises—they're multi-million dollar decisions that determine whether leagues grow, markets get teams, and careers are made.

**Apply ALL Course Frameworks:**
- Revenue ecosystem analysis (Week 1) for financial projections
- Media rights valuation (Week 2) for broadcast strategy
- Sponsorship ROI (Week 3) for partnership portfolio
- Brand building (Week 4) for launch strategy
- Legacy vs. innovation (Week 5) for long-term positioning

```
[0:00-0:09] Opening
"Congratulations! You've completed five weeks of the Business of Sports Marketing. You now have frameworks that working professionals use to make million-dollar decisions. Let's connect everything before your capstone."

[0:14-0:40] Week-by-Week Recap
"Week 1 taught you revenue ecosystems-the five streams and how they interconnect. Week 2 showed you media rights economics-how streaming changes valuations and the risks of long-term contracts. Week 3 covered sponsorship and betting-ROI frameworks and the attribution advantage. Week 4 explored athlete brands and emerging sports-the five revenue streams and evaluation frameworks. Week 5 added the final piece: Heritage and future trends. Not everything should be optimized for short-term revenue. Sometimes preservation creates long-term value."

[0:40-0:57] Capstone Integration
"Your capstone project-developing a strategy for an emerging sports franchise-requires you to integrate all five weeks. You're not just designing a brand. You're building a business case that considers: Revenue ecosystem design from Week 1, Media rights implications from Week 2, Sponsorship strategy from Week 3, Market positioning and athlete partnerships from Week 4, And heritage balance and future trends from Week 5."

[0:57-1:15] Multiple Objectives
"Your strategy needs to achieve multiple objectives. It should build sustainable revenue across all five streams. It should position your franchise competitively. It should be financially viable from day one."

[1:15-1:38] Real Strategic Thinking
"This is real strategic thinking. The frameworks you've learned aren't academic exercises-they're the same tools executives use to make these decisions. Good luck with your capstone. You have everything you need. Now show us what you can build."

**Your 5-Week Journey:**

You've traveled from Connor McDavid's $100M paradox through five weeks of transformative learning:

| Week | Focus | Key Skill |

| **Week 2** | Media & Fan Engagement | Media rights valuation |
| **Week 3** | Sponsorship & Betting | Sponsorship ROI modeling |
