## Element 1: Week 5 Key Takeaways

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Infobox** element in module builder
2. Choose variant: **Callout**
3. Copy the markdown below into the infobox content field

```
Title: ◉ Week 5 Key Takeaways

You've completed your deep dive into legacy, culture, and the future of sports business! The five critical insights: (1) heritage properties monetize nostalgia and tradition through experiences, not just artifacts—the Hockey Hall of Fame shows how to balance preservation with revenue generation, (2) legacy vs. innovation requires explicit trade-off analysis because you can't preserve everything while transforming—successful properties draw clear boundaries, (3) future trends including AI, VR/AR, sustainability, and global expansion will reshape sports business within the next decade, (4) cultural and social impact considerations are increasingly strategic decisions, not just PR—stakeholders expect authentic engagement, and (5) strategic synthesis means integrating all frameworks into a coherent vision where media, sponsorship, athlete brands, and legacy management reinforce each other. You've now mastered the complete sports business toolkit. Congratulations on completing this 5-week journey!

**Up Next:** CFL Expansion Milestone 5 (Final Proposal), then course completion.

## Element 2: Anchor Project Milestone 5 Introduction

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Text** element
2. Copy markdown below:

```markdown
## CFL Expansion Project: Milestone 5 - Final Expansion Proposal

This is it. You've spent four weeks developing your CFL expansion franchise: market analysis (Week 1), media strategy (Week 2), sponsorship portfolio (Week 3), and brand launch plan (Week 4). Now you'll synthesize everything into a comprehensive expansion proposal for the CFL Board of Governors.

**Your Challenge:** Create a board-ready expansion proposal that integrates Milestones 1-4 with financial projections, risk analysis, and a compelling 5-year vision.

**Why This Matters:** This is the real work sports executives do. Expansion proposals aren't academic exercises—they're multi-million dollar decisions that determine whether leagues grow, markets get teams, and careers are made.

**Apply ALL Course Frameworks:**
- Revenue ecosystem analysis (Week 1) for financial projections
- Media rights valuation (Week 2) for broadcast strategy
- Sponsorship ROI (Week 3) for partnership portfolio
- Brand building (Week 4) for launch strategy
- Legacy vs. innovation (Week 5) for long-term positioning
```

**Rubric Configuration:**

---

**CRITERION 1: Strategic Coherence**

**Points:** 12

**Description:**
Student integrates Milestones 1-4 into a unified strategic vision where market analysis, media strategy, sponsorship approach, and brand positioning reinforce each other.

**Does not meet expectations:** 0 points
Milestones appear as separate sections without integration. No clear thread connecting market analysis, media strategy, sponsorship portfolio, and brand approach. Reads like four independent proposals pasted together.

**Partially meets expectations:** 6 points
Some connections between milestones, but integration is surface-level. May reference prior work without showing how decisions in one area affect others. Missing logical flow from market selection → strategy → financials.

**Fully meets expectations:** 12 points
Milestones 1-4 clearly integrated into unified vision. Shows how market characteristics (M1) drive media strategy (M2), which informs sponsorship approach (M3), which shapes brand positioning (M4). Each decision logically builds on previous choices. Reader understands why THIS strategy for THIS market.

---

**CRITERION 2: Financial Rigor**

**Points:** 10

**Description:**
Student presents realistic 5-year financial projections with clear assumptions, complete P&L, and credible break-even analysis.

**Does not meet expectations:** 0 points
Financial projections missing, unrealistic, or unsupported. No clear assumptions stated. P&L incomplete or contains obvious errors. Break-even analysis absent or implausible.

**Partially meets expectations:** 5 points
Financial projections present but assumptions unclear or optimistic without justification. P&L shows basic structure but may miss key revenue streams or cost categories. Break-even timeline stated but not well-supported.

**Fully meets expectations:** 10 points
Realistic 5-year projections with clearly stated assumptions. P&L covers all five revenue streams with reasonable growth rates. Investment requirements and break-even timeline grounded in comparable franchise data or industry benchmarks. Shows understanding of sports business economics.

---

**CRITERION 3: Risk Assessment**

**Points:** 8

**Description:**
Student identifies material risks specific to this market and strategy, with concrete mitigation plans for each.

**Does not meet expectations:** 0 points
Risks not identified, or only generic risks listed ("competition," "economy") without specificity to this market/franchise. No mitigation strategies provided.

**Partially meets expectations:** 4 points
Identifies relevant risks but analysis is shallow. Mitigation strategies generic ("monitor closely," "adjust as needed") rather than specific actionable plans.

**Fully meets expectations:** 8 points
Identifies 3 specific, material risks tied to this market and strategy. For each risk: explains why it matters, quantifies potential impact where possible, and provides concrete mitigation strategy. Shows strategic thinking about what could go wrong and how to respond.

---

**CRITERION 4: Professional Communication**

**Points:** 10

**Description:**
Student delivers a board-ready executive summary with concise writing, compelling narrative, and effective use of tables and figures.

**Does not meet expectations:** 0 points
Document exceeds page limit, lacks clear structure, or contains significant grammar/formatting issues. Not appropriate for board presentation. Key information buried or missing.

**Partially meets expectations:** 5 points
Meets page limit and basic structure, but writing could be more concise. Some sections stronger than others. Adequate for internal review but needs polish for board presentation.

**Fully meets expectations:** 10 points

## Element 5: Video - Course Synthesis

- **Accessibility:** Captions required, transcript provided

**Video Status:** Produced - Caption file available

**Caption File:** `Videos/HeyGen Scripts/VIDEO #21 IO - Cohort - BOSM - W5-M6, V1 (Course Synthesis)-caption.srt`

**Video Content Summary (from caption, ~2 minutes):**
```
[0:00-0:09] Opening
"Congratulations! You've completed five weeks of the Business of Sports Marketing. You now have frameworks that working professionals use to make million-dollar decisions. Let's connect everything before your capstone."

[0:14-0:40] Week-by-Week Recap
"Week 1 taught you revenue ecosystems-the five streams and how they interconnect. Week 2 showed you media rights economics-how streaming changes valuations and the risks of long-term contracts. Week 3 covered sponsorship and betting-ROI frameworks and the attribution advantage. Week 4 explored athlete brands and emerging sports-the five revenue streams and evaluation frameworks. Week 5 added the final piece: Heritage and future trends. Not everything should be optimized for short-term revenue. Sometimes preservation creates long-term value."

[0:40-0:57] Capstone Integration
"Your capstone project-developing a strategy for an emerging sports franchise-requires you to integrate all five weeks. You're not just designing a brand. You're building a business case that considers: Revenue ecosystem design from Week 1, Media rights implications from Week 2, Sponsorship strategy from Week 3, Market positioning and athlete partnerships from Week 4, And heritage balance and future trends from Week 5."

[0:57-1:15] Multiple Objectives
"Your strategy needs to achieve multiple objectives. It should build sustainable revenue across all five streams. It should position your franchise competitively. It should be financially viable from day one."

[1:15-1:38] Real Strategic Thinking
"This is real strategic thinking. The frameworks you've learned aren't academic exercises-they're the same tools executives use to make these decisions. Good luck with your capstone. You have everything you need. Now show us what you can build."

## Element 5A: Text Response - Course Reflection `[v4.0.0]`

**Uplimit Implementation:**
1. Select **Exercise → Text Response Question**
2. Configure the following fields:

**Question:**
```
Looking back on your 5-week journey through sports business, what's your most valuable takeaway—and how will you apply it?
```

**Additional Instructions:**
```
This is an ungraded reflection to capture your learning. In 200-300 words, address:

1. **Your Key Insight**: What concept, framework, or case changed how you think about sports business? Be specific—not "I learned a lot about media rights" but "I didn't realize streaming contracts carry more risk than traditional broadcast deals because of subscriber churn."

2. **The Surprise**: What challenged an assumption you held coming into the course? What did you think you knew that turned out to be more complex?

3. **Your Application**: How will you use what you learned? This could be in your current role, a future career move, conversations with colleagues, or how you consume sports as a fan.

**Examples of strong reflections:**
- "The athlete brand framework changed how I view endorsement deals. I assumed more endorsements = better, but Serena's case showed that equity-based investments outperform fee-based income long-term. I'll apply this when advising clients on partnership structures."
- "I was surprised by how interconnected the five revenue streams are. The ecosystem cascade simulator showed that a media rights decision ripples through sponsorship, ticketing, and merchandise. I'll think more systemically about business decisions."

This reflection is for you—capture the insight while it's fresh.
```

**AI Feedback Prompt:**
```
This is an ungraded course reflection. Provide brief, encouraging feedback:
- Acknowledge their specific insight
- If they connected learning to application, note that positively
- If vague ("I learned a lot"), gently ask what specific moment or framework led to that learning

Keep feedback to 2-3 sentences. This closes their learning journey on a reflective note.
