- **MLO 5.2**: Design strategies balancing tradition preservation with innovation (applying frameworks to resolve tension between authenticity and growth)
- **MLO 5.3**: Assess future trends in sports business (forecasting impacts of AI, VR/AR, new demographics, emerging markets)

---

## Total Week 5 Time Estimate

- **Content consumption**: 95-105 minutes (videos, reading, widgets)
- **Active learning**: 135-160 minutes (simulation, case study, discussion)
- **Assessment**: 120-180 minutes (strategic vision memo - capstone assignment)
- **Total**: 6-7.5 hours

## Week 5 Widget Specifications

### Widget 1: Legacy vs Innovation Matrix (Module 3)

**Purpose**: Interactive tool for mapping strategic decisions on two axes: Tradition Preservation (low/high) and Revenue Growth (low/high), creating 4 strategic quadrants.

**User Flow**:
1. Student places 15 strategic initiatives on matrix by dragging into quadrants
2. Matrix provides real-time feedback on portfolio balance
3. Compares student's allocation to real heritage property strategies (HHOF, Olympics, FIFA)
4. Shows consequences of imbalanced strategies (too traditional = stagnation, too innovative = loss of authenticity)

**Full Specification**: See modules/module-3-core-content.md Element 2

---

### Widget 2: Heritage Property Analyzer (Module 3)

**Purpose**: Financial model for heritage sports properties (museums, halls of fame, legacy events), showing revenue breakdown and growth scenarios.

**User Flow**:
1. Select property type (Hall of Fame, Olympic Legacy, Historic Venue)
2. Adjust 5 revenue streams: Admissions, Events, Sponsorships, Digital/Media, Retail
3. Test 3 scenarios: Status Quo, Digital Transformation, Experience Innovation
4. Calculate 10-year ROI and visitor projections
5. Compare to benchmark properties

**Full Specification**: See modules/module-3-core-content.md Element 4

---

### Widget 3: Future Trends Simulator (Module 3)

**Purpose**: Forecast tool showing how emerging trends (AI, VR/AR, demographics, new sports) will impact sports business over 5-10 years.

**User Flow**:
1. Choose 3 trends to prioritize from 12 options
2. Allocate $50M investment across chosen trends
3. See projected impacts on revenue streams (from Weeks 1-4)
4. View scenario outcomes: Optimistic, Realistic, Pessimistic
5. Compare to expert predictions (McKinsey, Deloitte sports reports)

**Full Specification**: See modules/module-3-core-content.md Element 6

## V3 Interactive-First Application in Week 5

**Design Principles Applied**:
- ‚úÖ **No text block over 150 words** (synthesis week doesn't mean walls of text)
- ‚úÖ **Interactive widget every 2-3 elements** (3 major widgets in Module 3)
- ‚úÖ **Capstone integration**: Widgets designed to support final strategic vision memo
- ‚úÖ **Student agency**: All widgets allow experimentation and "what if" scenarios
- ‚úÖ **Progressive complexity**: Builds on Weeks 1-4 frameworks, applies to new context

**Engagement Target**:
- 75% active engagement through simulations, case analysis, strategic planning
- 25% passive reading (essential concepts and synthesis only)

---

## Week 5 Learning Path Integration

**Connection to Previous Weeks**:
- **Week 1**: Revenue streams become "monetization levers" in heritage context
- **Week 2**: Media rights principles apply to heritage content (documentaries, archives, digital streaming)
- **Week 3**: Sponsorship strategies for institutions (naming rights, partnerships that align with tradition)
- **Week 4**: Athlete legacy management (Hall of Fame inductees as brand assets)

**Unique Week 5 Challenge**:
Unlike Weeks 1-4 (growth-focused), Week 5 introduces **constraint**: You can't just maximize revenue if it compromises authenticity. This creates a new strategic dimension requiring trade-off analysis.

## Hockey Hall of Fame Case Study Overview

**Custom Case Structure** (4,000 words):

### Part 1: The Heritage Challenge
- HHOF history and current business model
- Revenue breakdown: Admissions 45%, Events 30%, Retail 15%, Sponsorships 10%
- Visitor trends: Declining domestic attendance (-8% annually), flat international
- Digital transformation imperative vs. "museum experience" tradition

### Part 2: Growth Opportunities & Risks
- **Opportunity 1**: Virtual HHOF (VR experiences, digital memberships)
- **Opportunity 2**: Pop-up exhibits in international markets
- **Opportunity 3**: Betting partnerships (leverage hockey data archives)
- **Risk**: "Disneyfication" - losing credibility as authentic heritage institution

### Part 3: Strategic Decision
Students recommend 1 of 3 paths:
1. **Preserve**: Minimal digital, focus on premium in-person experiences
2. **Transform**: Aggressive digital, VR/AR, global pop-ups
3. **Hybrid**: Balanced approach with clear boundaries

**Case Teaching Note**: Includes discussion prompts, exhibit data, financial projections
