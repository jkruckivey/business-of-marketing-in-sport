## Video 1: Bridge-In - "The Heritage Dilemma"
**Module:** 0 (Bridge-In)
**Duration:** 2 minutes (trimmed from 3:30 original)
**Purpose:** Hook students with heritage monetization challenge

```
[0:00-0:15] INTRODUCTION
"Hi, I'm [NAME], and I've spent [X] years advising heritage sports properties on digital transformation.

I've been in boardrooms where executives face an impossible choice: Preserve tradition and watch revenues decline, or innovate aggressively and risk losing your soul."

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "The Heritage Dilemma"]

[0:15-0:45] THE CHALLENGE
"Imagine you're CEO of the Hockey Hall of Fame. Your institution generates $18 million annually—respectable, but flat over 5 years.

Your board proposes transformation: VR zones, AI-powered tours, international pop-ups. Financial projections show you could double revenue to $43 million."

[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "$18M → $43M (139% growth)"]

[0:45-1:15] THE CATCH
"But there's a catch. Your curatorial staff resigns in protest—they call it 'Disneyfication.' Long-time members cancel. Donors who value authenticity threaten to leave.

If you lose credibility, you lose $4M in donations AND your unique position as hockey's authoritative voice.

The question isn't 'Can we make more money?' It's 'Can we grow WITHOUT losing what makes us valuable?'"

[1:15-1:45] THIS WEEK'S FOCUS
"This is the heritage monetization dilemma. You can't just apply Weeks 1-4 frameworks—revenue matters, but so does authenticity.

This week, you'll learn:
- How to evaluate heritage properties as revenue assets
- Frameworks for balancing tradition with innovation
- How to forecast future trends strategically
- How to create 5-year visions that grow revenue WITHOUT compromising credibility"

[1:45-2:00] CALL TO ACTION
"But first: Could you solve this NOW? If I gave you the Hockey Hall of Fame challenge, could you double revenue while preserving credibility? Take the diagnostic next to find out."
