**Purpose:** Introduce heritage property economics before the Legacy vs Innovation Matrix widget
**Placement:** Module 3 (Core Content)

### SCRIPT

**[0:00-0:15] Hook**

**[ON-SCREEN: Hockey Hall of Fame exterior + "Problem: -8% annual attendance"]**

**NARRATOR:**
The Hockey Hall of Fame houses 100 years of hockey history. But here's the challenge: visitors are declining 8% per year, and the building can't move.

How do you monetize history without compromising authenticity?

---

**[0:15-0:45] The Heritage Property Challenge**

**[ANIMATION: Four types of heritage properties appearing]**

**NARRATOR:**
Heritage properties include:

- **Halls of fame:** Hockey, Baseball, Basketball, Football
- **Historic venues:** Fenway Park, Wrigley Field, Wimbledon
- **Legacy events:** The Masters, Kentucky Derby, Olympics
- **Museums and archives:** Sports memorabilia, broadcasting history

**[ON-SCREEN: Unique constraints appearing]**

These properties share a unique constraint: **You can't just maximize revenue.** Aggressive commercialization destroys the very authenticity that makes them valuable.

Add a Jumbotron to Fenway Park? Fans revolt. Turn the Hall of Fame into a theme park? You lose credibility.

---

**[0:45-1:15] The Revenue Model**

**[ANIMATION: Revenue pie chart for heritage properties]**

**NARRATOR:**
Heritage properties typically generate revenue from five sources:

**[ON-SCREEN: Five sources with percentages]**

1. **Admissions (40-50%):** Ticket sales, memberships
2. **Events (20-30%):** Weddings, corporate rentals, inductions
3. **Retail (10-15%):** Merchandise, memorabilia
4. **Sponsorships (10-15%):** Naming rights, partnerships
5. **Digital/Media (5-10%):** Archives, streaming, licensing

The challenge? **Admissions are declining.** Younger generations visit museums less. Travel patterns have changed. Digital alternatives compete for attention.

---

**[1:15-1:45] The Innovation Imperative**

**[ANIMATION: Two paths diverging - stagnation vs. transformation]**

**NARRATOR:**
Heritage properties face a choice:

**Path 1: Preserve.** Maintain the traditional experience. Accept declining attendance. Hope nostalgia sustains you.

**Path 2: Transform.** Embrace digital, create virtual experiences, expand globally. Risk alienating traditionalists.

**[ON-SCREEN: HHOF digital initiatives]**

The Hockey Hall of Fame is testing virtual tours, esports integrations, and pop-up exhibits in international markets. Can they grow revenue without losing authenticity?

That's the strategic question you'll explore this week.

---

**[1:45-2:00] Transition**

**[ON-SCREEN: Legacy vs Innovation Matrix preview]**

**NARRATOR:**
Next, you'll use the **Legacy vs Innovation Matrix** to map strategic decisions across two axes: tradition preservation and revenue growth. See how real heritage properties balance this tension—and design your own approach.

**[END SCREEN]**

## Video 2: The Legacy vs Innovation Trade-Off (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Explain the strategic framework before interactive exercises
**Placement:** Module 3 (Core Content)

### SCRIPT

**[0:00-0:15] Hook**

**[ON-SCREEN: Two newspaper headlines - "Masters Protects Tradition" vs. "Olympics Embrace Change"]**

**NARRATOR:**
The Masters Golf Tournament bans cell phones, limits commercials, and changes nothing. The Olympics add breakdancing, esports, and 3×3 basketball.

Both are heritage properties. Both are successful. They just made different strategic choices.

---

**[0:15-0:45] The Four Quadrants**

**[ANIMATION: 2×2 matrix appearing]**

**NARRATOR:**
Every heritage property strategy falls into one of four quadrants:

**[ON-SCREEN: Matrix with labels]**

**Quadrant 1: Purist (High Tradition, Low Growth)**
Protect authenticity above all. Accept limited revenue. Examples: Augusta National, Wimbledon's grass courts.

**Quadrant 2: Innovator (Low Tradition, High Growth)**
Aggressively modernize. Risk alienating traditionalists. Examples: UFC, Formula E.

**Quadrant 3: Stagnant (Low Tradition, Low Growth)**
The danger zone. Lost identity AND lost revenue. Many failed leagues end here.

**Quadrant 4: Balanced (High Tradition, High Growth)**
The sweet spot. Preserve core while innovating at the edges. Examples: NFL, Premier League.

---

**[0:45-1:15] Finding the Balance**

**[ANIMATION: Dial moving between tradition and innovation]**

**NARRATOR:**
The key insight: **There's no single right answer.** The optimal balance depends on your property's unique assets.

**[ON-SCREEN: Three questions appearing]**

Ask three questions:

**One:** What's our irreplaceable core? (For HHOF: the Stanley Cup, the induction ceremony, the historical artifacts)

**Two:** What's negotiable? (Gift shop layout, digital experiences, satellite locations)

**Three:** What would destroy our credibility? (Selling naming rights to the Cup, gamifying the induction)

---

**[1:15-1:45] Real Examples**

**[ANIMATION: Case examples appearing]**

**NARRATOR:**
**Example 1: The Masters**

Core: Azalea-lined fairways, green jackets, limited commercials.
Innovation: Masters app, live streaming, international qualifying.
Result: $200+ million revenue, brand value intact.

**Example 2: Olympic Games**

Core: Opening ceremony, athlete stories, global unity.
Innovation: New sports (skateboarding, surfing), social media integration, esports exhibitions.
Result: Record engagement, but ongoing debates about "Olympic spirit."

---

**[1:45-2:00] Transition**

**[ON-SCREEN: Heritage Property Analyzer preview]**

**NARRATOR:**
Next, you'll use the **Heritage Property Analyzer** to model different transformation scenarios. Test what happens when you shift investment toward digital, events, or global expansion—and see the 10-year revenue impact.

**[END SCREEN]**

## Video 3: Future Trends in Sports Business (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Introduce emerging trends before the Future Trends Simulator
**Placement:** Module 3 (Core Content)

### SCRIPT

**[0:00-0:15] Hook**

**[ON-SCREEN: Split screen - 1995 stadium vs. 2025 stadium with AR overlays]**

**NARRATOR:**
In 1995, you watched sports on TV or in person. By 2035, you might watch from inside a virtual stadium, bet on every play, and interact with AI commentators.

The next decade will transform sports more than the last fifty years.

---

**[0:15-0:45] The Six Megatrends**

**[ANIMATION: Six trends appearing with icons]**

**NARRATOR:**
Six megatrends are reshaping sports business:

**[ON-SCREEN: Trends appearing one by one]**

**1. AI and Machine Learning**
Personalized highlights, AI coaching, automated content creation. The NY Giants already use enterprise AI for talent evaluation.

**2. Immersive Technology (VR/AR)**
Virtual attendance, augmented broadcasts, holographic replays. Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest are building the infrastructure.

**3. Direct-to-Consumer Everything**
Leagues bypassing networks. Teams building apps. Athletes selling directly to fans. Disintermediation across the value chain.

---

**[0:45-1:15] More Megatrends**

**[ANIMATION: Remaining trends appearing]**

**NARRATOR:**
**4. Demographic Shifts**
Gen Z watches highlights, not full games. International audiences growing faster than domestic. Women's sports reaching parity.

**5. Sports Betting Integration**
Real-time betting woven into broadcasts. Player prop markets driving engagement. Data becoming a core revenue stream.

**6. Climate and Sustainability**
Carbon-neutral stadiums, sustainable merchandise, climate-adjusted scheduling. No longer optional—sponsors and fans demand it.

---

**[1:15-1:45] What This Means**

**[ANIMATION: Industry impact visualization]**

**NARRATOR:**
For sports marketers, these trends create both opportunity and disruption:

**[ON-SCREEN: Key implications]**

- **Media rights** will be valued on engagement, not just eyeballs
- **Sponsorship** will require data integration, not just logo placement
- **Fan experience** will blend physical and digital seamlessly
- **New properties** (esports, emerging sports) may leapfrog traditional ones

**[ON-SCREEN: Tim McLaughlin quote]**

Remember Tim McLaughlin from Golf Canada: *"AI will be a proactive partner in coaching."* The organizations that embrace these trends early will win.

---

**[1:45-2:00] Transition**

**[ON-SCREEN: Future Trends Simulator preview]**

**NARRATOR:**
Next, you'll use the **Future Trends Simulator** to forecast how these trends will impact sports business over 5-10 years. Choose three trends to prioritize, allocate investment, and see projected outcomes compared to expert predictions.
