**[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]**

**[ON-SCREEN: "The Heritage Dilemma"]**

**SME:**
Executives at heritage sports properties face an impossible choice: Preserve tradition and watch revenues decline, or innovate aggressively and risk losing your soul.

---

**[SECTION: THE CHALLENGE - 0:15-0:45]**

**SME:**
Imagine you're CEO of a heritage institution. Your institution generates steady annual revenue—respectable, but flat over several years.

Your board proposes transformation: VR experiences, AI-powered tours, pop-ups in new markets. The projections show you could increase annual revenue substantially.

**[ON-SCREEN: "Revenue Growth Potential (%)"]**

---

**[SECTION: THE CATCH - 0:45-1:15]**

**SME:**
But there's a catch. Your curatorial staff resigns in protest—they call it commercialization. Long-time members cancel. Donors who value authenticity threaten to leave.

If you lose credibility, you lose donations AND your position as the authoritative voice in your field.

The question isn't "Can we make more money?" It's "Can we grow WITHOUT losing what makes us valuable?"

---

**[SECTION: THIS WEEK - 1:15-1:45]**

**SME:**
This is the heritage monetization dilemma. You can't just apply Weeks 1-4 frameworks. Revenue matters, but so does authenticity. Media strategy works, but not if it commodifies your history.

This week, you'll learn frameworks for balancing tradition with innovation. You'll hear from executives who've made these decisions. And you'll develop your own strategic vision.

---

**[CLOSING - 1:45-2:00]**

**SME:**
But first: Could you solve this now? If I gave you this challenge, could you increase revenue while preserving credibility? Take the diagnostic to find out.

## VIDEO #18 IO - Cohort - BOSM – W5-M2, V1 (Heritage Framework)

**Purpose:** Introduce the Heritage Balance Grid
**Placement:** Module 2 (Executive Interviews)
**Visual Style:** SME with animated framework

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]**

**SME:**
Heritage properties face a unique constraint: Your authenticity IS your asset. Monetize too aggressively, and you destroy the very thing people value. But refuse to evolve, and you become irrelevant.

---

**[SECTION: THE GRID - 0:15-0:45]**

**[ANIMATION: Heritage Balance Grid appearing]**

**SME:**
Use the Heritage Balance Grid. On one axis: Revenue Impact—how much money does this generate? On the other axis: Authenticity Risk—how much does this threaten our credibility? Plot every opportunity on this grid.

High revenue, low risk: Digital archive access, expanded merchandise, membership tiers. These are obvious wins. Low revenue, high risk: Branded experiences that feel disconnected from mission, entertainment-first initiatives. These require extreme caution.

**[ON-SCREEN: "Revenue Impact vs. Authenticity Risk"]**

---

**[SECTION: THE DANGER ZONE - 0:45-1:15]**

**SME:**
The dangerous quadrant is high revenue, high risk. An initiative might generate significant revenue, but if stakeholders perceive it as inconsistent with your mission, donors and members revolt.

The question isn't whether it makes money—it's whether it makes money AND preserves what matters.

Here's the key insight: Authenticity is not binary. You can extend reach without replacing substance. Digital access to archives serves your mission AND generates revenue. That's alignment.

---

**[SECTION: THREE TESTS - 1:15-1:45]**

**SME:**
Three tests for any initiative. First, does it serve your mission or replace it? Mission-aligned programs vs. mission-compromising programs.

Second, would your most loyal stakeholders accept it? If core community members say "that's not who we are," listen carefully.

Third, is it reversible? Experiments are fine; permanent damage isn't.

---

**[CLOSING - 1:45-2:00]**

**SME:**
The executives you'll hear from use versions of this framework—but they draw the lines in different places. Watch for where they agree and where they diverge.

## VIDEO #19 IO - Cohort - BOSM – W5-M3, V1 (Future Trends)

**Purpose:** Overview of key industry trends shaping the next decade
**Placement:** Module 3 (Interactive)
**Visual Style:** SME with trend graphics

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]**

**[ON-SCREEN: "Sports Business 2030"]**

**SME:**
What will sports business look like in 2030? Five trends are reshaping the industry. Understanding them helps you build strategies that last, not just strategies that work today.

---

**[SECTION: TRENDS 1-2 - 0:15-0:45]**

**SME:**
Trend one: Direct-to-consumer everything. Leagues and teams are building their own streaming platforms, apps, and membership programs. Why share revenue with broadcasters when you can own the customer relationship? The major North American leagues are all investing heavily in D2C infrastructure.

Trend two: Sports betting integration deepens. We're moving from sponsorship to embedded products. Imagine watching a game where betting is integrated into the broadcast—odds updating in real-time, one-click wagering. This changes media rights valuations fundamentally.

**[ON-SCREEN: "D2C + Betting Integration"]**

---

**[SECTION: TRENDS 3-4 - 0:45-1:15]**

**SME:**
Trend three: Women's sports reach parity economics. Within the next decade, top women's leagues will command valuations comparable to men's second-tier leagues. Early investors will see significant returns. The WNBA trajectory shows this is already happening.

Trend four: AI transforms operations. From ticket pricing to injury prediction to fan engagement, AI is being deployed across every function. The teams that master AI-driven personalization will win the fan engagement battle.

**[ON-SCREEN: "Women's Sports + AI Transformation"]**

---

**[SECTION: TREND 5 - 1:15-1:45]**

**SME:**
Trend five: Heritage becomes competitive advantage. As sports become more commercial, the properties with authentic history become more valuable. Storied franchises and legacy organizations aren't just teams—they're cultural institutions.

That heritage creates pricing power and fan loyalty that new franchises can't replicate.

---

**[CLOSING - 1:45-2:00]**

**SME:**
Your league executive's vision reflects several of these trends. They're balancing entertainment innovation with heritage preservation while planning for expansion. Their interview shows how league leaders think about 10-year horizons.

## VIDEO #20 IO - Cohort - BOSM – W5-M4, V1 (HHOF Case)

**Purpose:** Frame the case study analysis
**Placement:** Module 4 (Case Study)
**Visual Style:** SME direct-to-camera

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]**

**SME:**
This case study isn't about hockey specifically. It's about every heritage property facing the same dilemma: How do you grow without becoming something you're not?

---

**[SECTION: THE TENSION - 0:15-0:45]**

**SME:**
The case presents a real strategic tension. The Hockey Hall of Fame generates revenue from admission, retail, and hospitality. The board wants to propose growth initiatives that could substantially increase annual revenue. The staff and donors want to preserve the institution's integrity.

Both sides have legitimate arguments.

Here's what makes this case hard: The growth opportunities ARE real. VR experiences could attract younger audiences. International pop-ups could tap new markets. The revenue projections aren't fantasy.

---

**[SECTION: THE RISKS - 0:45-1:15]**

**SME:**
But the risks are also real. Heritage institutions that over-commercialize lose credibility permanently. Once you're perceived as a theme park, you can't go back to being a serious cultural institution.

The curatorial staff and donors aren't being stubborn—they're protecting something valuable.

Your analysis should avoid two traps. Trap one: Assuming growth always wins. Sometimes preservation IS the strategy. Trap two: Assuming tradition always wins. Institutions that refuse all change become irrelevant.

---

**[SECTION: THE ANSWER - 1:15-1:45]**

**SME:**
The right answer is boundary-setting. What specific initiatives preserve authenticity while driving growth? Where exactly is the line between acceptable innovation and mission-compromise?

That line is different for every organization—your job is to find where it is for a heritage institution.

---

**[CLOSING - 1:45-2:00]**

**SME:**
As you watch the executive interviews, note how each leader defines their boundaries. Their answers reveal different philosophies about heritage and growth.

## VIDEO #21 IO - Cohort - BOSM – W5-M6, V1 (Course Synthesis)

**Purpose:** Connect all five weeks and preview the capstone
**Placement:** Module 6 (Wrap-Up)
**Visual Style:** SME direct-to-camera

### SCRIPT

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]**

**SME:**
Congratulations—you've completed five weeks of the Business of Sports Marketing. You now have frameworks that working professionals use to make million-dollar decisions. Let's connect everything before your capstone.

---

**[SECTION: FIVE WEEKS - 0:15-0:45]**

**[ON-SCREEN: Week summaries appearing]**

**SME:**
Week 1 taught you revenue ecosystems—the five streams and how they interconnect. Week 2 showed you media rights economics—how streaming changes valuations and the risks of long-term contracts.

Week 3 covered sponsorship and betting—ROI frameworks and the attribution advantage. Week 4 explored athlete brands and emerging sports—the five revenue streams and evaluation frameworks.

Week 5 added the final piece: Heritage and future trends. Not everything should be optimized for short-term revenue. Sometimes preservation creates long-term value.

---

**[SECTION: CAPSTONE - 0:45-1:15]**

**SME:**
Your capstone project—developing a strategy for an emerging sports franchise—requires you to integrate all five weeks. You're not just designing a brand. You're building a business case that considers:

Revenue ecosystem design from Week 1. Media rights implications from Week 2. Sponsorship strategy from Week 3. Market positioning and athlete partnerships from Week 4. And heritage balance and future trends from Week 5.

**[ON-SCREEN: "Capstone: Multi-Dimensional Sports Strategy"]**

---

**[SECTION: SUCCESS CRITERIA - 1:15-1:45]**

**SME:**
Your strategy needs to achieve multiple objectives. It should build sustainable revenue across all five streams. It should position your franchise competitively. It should be financially viable from day one.

This is real strategic thinking. The frameworks you've learned aren't academic exercises—they're the same tools executives use to make these decisions.

---

**[CLOSING - 1:45-2:00]**

**SME:**
Good luck with your capstone. You have everything you need. Now show us what you can build.

**[ON-SCREEN: "Good Luck!"]**
