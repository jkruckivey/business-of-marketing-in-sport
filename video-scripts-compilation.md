## Week 1 Course Introduction

### Video 1: "The $100 Million Question" (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Hook students with a real business paradox that sets up the entire course
**Placement:** Module 0 (Bridge-In) - Very first video of the course
**Format:** Direct-to-camera SME presentation
**File:** `week1-bridge-scenario.mp4`

**SCRIPT:**

**[0:00-0:20] INTRODUCTION**

**SME:**
"Hi, I'm [NAME], and I've spent [X] years working in professional sport. I want to start this course with a problem that's kept me up at night."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "The $100 Million Question"]**

---

**[0:20-1:00] THE PARADOX**

**SME:**
"Imagine you're the GM of an NHL team. You just signed Connor McDavid to a $100 million, 8-year contract—$12.5 million per year.

Your CFO tracks the impacts: Ticket sales jump $5 million. Jersey sales spike $3 million. That's $8 million in new revenue.

Your board asks: 'Why did we just LOSE $4.5 million per year on this deal?'"

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "$12.5M cost - $8M revenue = -$4.5M loss?"]**

---

**[1:00-1:30] THE REFRAME**

**SME:**
"Here's what I learned: If you're asking that question, you're measuring the WRONG things.

Connor McDavid isn't worth $8 million. He's worth $30 to $40 million per year.

There's a revenue ecosystem at play—media deals that hinge on star power, sponsorships that activate around marquee players, betting handles that spike when he takes the ice."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Actual Value: $30-40M/year"]**

---

**[1:30-2:00] CALL TO ACTION**

**SME:**
"This week, you'll learn to see that ecosystem. You'll map five major revenue streams and understand why they're interdependent.

But first—can you already solve this problem? Take the diagnostic exercise that follows. Reveal your knowledge gaps now, so we can fill them together."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Next: Diagnostic Exercise"]**

### Video 2: Five Revenue Streams in Professional Sports (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Quick introduction to the five major revenue streams
**Placement:** Module 3 (Five Revenue Streams)

**SCRIPT:**

**[0:00-0:15] OPENING**

**[ON-SCREEN: Five revenue stream icons appearing]**

**MATTHEW:**
Professional sports generates revenue from five major sources. Understanding these streams is essential for analyzing sports business strategy.

---

**[0:15-1:45] THE FIVE STREAMS**

**[ANIMATION: Each stream appears with percentage]**

**MATTHEW:**
**Stream #1: Media Rights (40-60% of revenue)**
Broadcasting and streaming deals. The NFL's current media rights total $110 billion over 11 years.

**Stream #2: Ticketing & Live Events (20-30%)**
Not just ticket sales—luxury suites, dynamic pricing, concessions. Teams generate $40-50 per attendee beyond the ticket price.

**Stream #3: Sponsorship & Partnerships (15-25%)**
Naming rights, jersey sponsors, category partnerships. Scotiabank Arena pays $30-50 million per year.

**Stream #4: Merchandising & Licensing (5-10%)**
Jerseys, hats, video games. Often pooled and shared equally across teams.

**Stream #5: Betting & Gaming (2-8%, growing fast)**
The newest frontier. Growing 30-40% year-over-year.

---

**[1:45-2:00] CONCLUSION**

**[ANIMATION: Five streams connecting as ecosystem]**

**MATTHEW:**
**Key insight:** These streams don't exist in isolation. They're interconnected. Investment in one stream amplifies others.

Successful organizations build revenue **ecosystems**, not portfolios.

**[END: 2:00]**

---

### Video 3: Sponsorship & Merchandising Overview (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Covers brand-driven revenue streams
**Placement:** Module 3, after ticketing section

**SCRIPT:**

**[0:00-0:15] OPENING**

**MATTHEW:**
While media rights and ticketing depend on the game itself, two revenue streams are driven by **brand value**: sponsorship and merchandising.

---

**[0:15-1:00] SPONSORSHIP**

**[ANIMATION: Stadium with naming rights, jersey patches]**

**MATTHEW:**
**Sponsorship: 15-25% of Revenue**

Naming rights like Scotiabank Arena—$800 million over 20 years. Jersey sponsorship reached North America in 2017—top deals reach $20-30 million per year.

But the best sponsors don't just buy logos—they create **experiences**. Scotiabank's "Scene+ Night" integrates their loyalty program with ticket offers. Fans remember positive moments, not logos.

---

**[1:00-1:45] MERCHANDISING**

**[ANIMATION: Jerseys, merchandise]**

**MATTHEW:**
**Merchandising: 5-10% of Revenue**

Most leagues use a **centralized model**—pool all licensing, split revenue equally. This prevents the Yankees and Cowboys from dominating sales.

Revenue spikes during championship runs (200-400% increases), star acquisitions, and new designs. Digital commerce lets teams sell globally—the Raptors ship to 85+ countries.

---

**[1:45-2:00] CONCLUSION**

**MATTHEW:**
**Key insight:** These are **brand-driven revenue streams**. The stronger your brand, the more valuable your sponsorship inventory and merchandise sales.

**[END: 2:00]**

---

### Video 4: Revenue Sharing Models (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Explain why and how leagues share revenue
**Placement:** Module 5 (Before Case Study)

**SCRIPT:**

**[0:00-0:15] OPENING**

**MATTHEW:**
Unlike most industries, professional sports leagues NEED their competitors to thrive. Competitive balance creates a better product—and makes everyone more money.

This is the logic behind **revenue sharing**.

---

**[0:15-1:45] THREE MODELS**

**[ANIMATION: Three league models]**

**MATTHEW:**
**Model #1: NFL—Maximum Socialism (60% shared)**
Nearly all revenue is shared equally. The Green Bay Packers (population 105,000) generate similar revenue to the New York Giants. Highest competitive parity in sports.

**Model #2: NHL—Moderate Sharing (50% shared)**
National media rights and merchandise are shared. Local revenue stays with teams. Plus a revenue sharing pool for struggling teams.

The complication? Canadian teams earn in Canadian dollars but pay players in U.S. dollars.

**Model #3: Premier League—Tiered Distribution**
TV revenue split: 50% equal, 25% based on finishing position, 25% based on TV appearances. Rewards success while maintaining baseline competitiveness.

---

**[1:45-2:00] CONCLUSION**

**MATTHEW:**
**Why this matters:** Revenue sharing limits strategic options, creates governance tensions, and affects team valuations.

**[END: 2:00]**

---

### Video 5: The Rogers NHL Deal Overview (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Context for Week 2 Rogers case study
**Placement:** Week 1 Module 7 (Week 2 preview)

**SCRIPT:**

**[0:00-0:15] OPENING**

**[ON-SCREEN: $5.2 BILLION - 12 YEARS]**

**MATTHEW:**
November 2013: Rogers paid $5.2 billion for exclusive Canadian NHL rights—the largest sports media deal in Canadian history.

Ten years later? They lost an estimated $1-1.5 billion. What happened?

---

**[0:15-1:15] THE BET & THE FAILURE**

**MATTHEW:**
**Rogers' Three Strategic Goals:**

**1. Defend cable subscribers.** They believed NHL rights would prevent cord-cutting.
**Reality:** Canadian cable subscribers dropped 28%. Hockey didn't stop the decline.

**2. Build streaming dominance.** They projected 1+ million Sportsnet NOW subscribers.
**Reality:** They reached only 450,000—missing targets by 50-70% every year.

**3. Brand positioning.** Become Canada's #1 sports network.
**Partial success:** Built brand equity at massive financial cost.

---

**[1:15-1:45] THE FATAL FLAW**

**MATTHEW:**
Rogers paid $433 million per year but generated only $200-380 million. They never achieved profitability.

COVID Impact: 2020-21 season collapse. Rogers still paid full rights fees with no flexibility clause. Lost $233 million in one year alone.

---

**[1:45-2:00] CONCLUSION**

**MATTHEW:**
**Lessons:** Content alone isn't enough. Flexibility clauses are worth the cost. 12-year deals are dangerous in a disrupted landscape.

In Week 2, you'll analyze this deal and recommend what Rogers should do when it expires in 2026.

**[END: 2:00]**

# WEEK 2: Media Rights & Fan Engagement

---

## Week 2 Introduction

### Video 6: Welcome to Week 2 - The Billion-Dollar Broadcast (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Orient students to Week 2, connect to Week 1 learning, preview key concepts
**Placement:** Module 0 (Bridge-In) - First video of Week 2
**Format:** Direct-to-camera SME presentation
**File:** `week2-introduction.mp4`

**SCRIPT:**

**[0:00-0:20] CONNECTION TO WEEK 1**

**MATTHEW:**
"Last week, you mapped the five revenue streams of professional sports. You discovered that media rights represent 40-60% of most leagues' revenue—the single largest slice of the pie.

This week, we go deeper. How do you value a broadcast deal worth billions?"

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Week 2: Media Rights & Fan Engagement"]**

---

**[0:20-1:00] THE ROGERS QUESTION**

**MATTHEW:**
"In 2013, Rogers Communications made a bet: $5.2 billion for exclusive Canadian NHL rights over 12 years.

At the time, analysts called it brilliant—locking up Canada's most-watched sport. Ten years later? Rogers reportedly lost over $1 billion.

What went wrong? And more importantly—what would YOU have done differently?"

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "$5.2 BILLION → $1+ BILLION LOSS?"]**

---

**[1:00-1:30] THIS WEEK'S JOURNEY**

**MATTHEW:**
"This week, you'll learn to value media rights like a network executive. You'll compare traditional broadcasting to streaming economics—a distinction worth billions.

You'll step into the Streaming Wars simulation, building your own sports platform from scratch. And you'll analyze the Rogers deal using real financial data."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Streaming Wars Simulation | Rogers Case Analysis"]**

---

**[1:30-2:00] CFL PROJECT CONNECTION**

**MATTHEW:**
"For your CFL Expansion Project, you'll evaluate broadcast partnerships for your new market. The frameworks you learn this week—media rights valuation, streaming vs. linear economics—will directly inform your Milestone 2 analysis.

Ready to understand why media companies bet billions on sports? Let's begin."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Next: Executive Insights"]**

## Week 2 Instructional Videos

### Video 7: How to Value Sports Media Rights (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Introduce the 5-factor valuation framework
**Placement:** Module 3 (Media Rights Framework)

**SCRIPT:**

**[0:00-0:15] OPENING**

**MATTHEW:**
"Amazon paid $1 billion per year for NFL Thursday Night Football. Rogers paid $5.2 billion for NHL rights.

How do media companies decide what sports content is worth? **The Five-Factor Valuation Framework.**"

---

**[0:15-1:45] THE FIVE FACTORS**

**MATTHEW:**
**Factor #1: Audience Size & Demographics**
NFL delivers 20 million viewers with premium demographics. Advertisers pay $50-70 per thousand viewers—double non-sports rates.

**Factor #2: Exclusivity & Competition**
More bidders = higher prices. Exclusive rights cost 2-3× more than non-exclusive.

**Factor #3: Content Volume & Scheduling**
One NFL primetime game is worth 10-15 mid-week NHL games. Concentrated scheduling creates predictable audience habits.

**Factor #4: Brand Alignment & Sponsorship**
Sponsorship revenue can subsidize 20-35% of rights costs.

**Factor #5: Platform Strategy Fit**
Amazon's $1B/year for NFL drives 3-5M new Prime memberships. Total strategic value: ~$900M/year.

**Warning:** Strategic value must be measurable. Rogers couldn't prove "subscriber defense."

---

**[1:45-2:00] CONCLUSION**

**MATTHEW:**
In the Streaming Wars simulation, you'll apply this framework to make your own billion-dollar decisions.

**[END: 2:00]**

---

### Video 8: Linear TV vs. Streaming Economics (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Compare traditional broadcasting to streaming business models
**Placement:** Module 3

**SCRIPT:**

**[0:00-0:15] OPENING**

**MATTHEW:**
For 50 years, sports media economics were simple: Broadcast games, sell ads, make money.

Then streaming arrived. **Linear TV vs. Streaming:** Fundamentally different economics.

---

**[0:15-1:00] REVENUE & COSTS**

**[SPLIT SCREEN: Linear TV left, Streaming right]**

**MATTHEW:**
**Revenue Models:**
- **Linear TV:** Advertising (70-80%) + Carriage fees (20-30%)
- **Streaming:** Subscriptions (80-95%) + Optional ads

**Key difference:** Linear monetizes AUDIENCE. Streaming monetizes SUBSCRIBERS.

**Cost Structures:**
- **Linear TV:** Rights fees + Production. Infrastructure already exists.
- **Streaming:** Rights + Technology + Customer Acquisition ($50-200 per subscriber).

---

**[1:00-1:45] PROFITABILITY & RISKS**

**MATTHEW:**
**Profitability Timelines:**
- **Linear TV:** Immediate (if priced right)
- **Streaming:** 3-5 years to break even

**Key Risks:**
- **Linear TV:** Cord-cutting. Canadian subscribers down 28% since 2014.
- **Streaming:** High churn (25-40% annual), competition from tech giants.

---

**[1:45-2:00] CONCLUSION**

**MATTHEW:**
**Most successful strategy? Hybrid.** Maintain linear TV cash flow while building streaming.

The risk? Cord-cutting cannibalizes faster than streaming grows. That's what happened to Rogers.

**[END: 2:00]**

---

### Video 9: Rogers Retrospective - What Went Wrong (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Condensed analysis of Rogers NHL deal outcomes
**Placement:** Module 5 (Case Study)

**SCRIPT:**

**[0:00-0:20] OPENING**

**MATTHEW:**
In 2013, Rogers paid $5.2 billion for NHL rights. Ten years later, they lost over $1 billion. Here's the 2-minute retrospective.

---

**[0:20-1:00] WHAT WENT WRONG**

**MATTHEW:**
**Fatal Flaw #1: Overestimated Subscriber Defense**
Rogers assumed hockey would prevent cord-cutting. Canadian cable subscribers dropped 28% anyway. Financial impact: $3.5 billion in missed projections.

**Fatal Flaw #2: Underinvested in Streaming**
Sportsnet NOW was barebones—just live games, frequent crashes. They missed subscriber targets by 50-70% every year.

**Fatal Flaw #3: No Flexibility Clause**
When COVID hit, Rogers paid full rights fees with no revenue. Lost $233 million in 2020-21 alone.

---

**[1:00-1:30] WHAT WENT RIGHT**

**MATTHEW:**
It wasn't all failure:

- **Maintained linear + streaming hybrid** when others went all-in on streaming
- **Built brand equity**—Sportsnet became synonymous with NHL hockey
- **Learned expensive lessons**—recent deals are shorter-term, non-exclusive, partnered

---

**[1:30-2:00] KEY LESSONS**

**MATTHEW:**
1. Strategic value must be measurable
2. Content is table stakes—experience drives retention
3. Flexibility clauses are worth the cost
4. Partner to de-risk
5. Know when to walk away

**[END: 2:00]**

## Week 3 Introduction

### Video 10: Welcome to Week 3 - Follow the Money (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Orient students to Week 3, connect to Week 2 learning, preview key concepts
**Placement:** Module 0 (Bridge-In) - First video of Week 3
**Format:** Direct-to-camera SME presentation
**File:** `week3-introduction.mp4`

**SCRIPT:**

**[0:00-0:20] CONNECTION TO WEEK 2**

**MATTHEW:**
"Last week, you valued media rights and navigated the streaming wars. You saw how Rogers bet $5.2 billion on content—and how quickly that landscape can shift.

This week, we follow a different money trail: the brands that PAY to be associated with sports."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Week 3: Sponsorship & Betting"]**

---

**[0:20-1:00] THE SPONSORSHIP QUESTION**

**MATTHEW:**
"Why does Scotiabank pay $800 million to put their name on an arena? Why do brands spend 2-3 times their sponsorship fee on 'activation'—ads, hospitality, retail displays?

And the bigger question: How do you PROVE sponsorship works? Most brands can't measure ROI. They're guessing. This week, you'll learn frameworks that separate smart investments from vanity plays."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "$800M Arena Naming Rights—Worth It?"]**

---

**[1:00-1:30] THE BETTING EXPLOSION**

**MATTHEW:**
"Then there's the newest frontier: sports betting. In 2018, PASPA fell. In 2023, Americans legally wagered $120 billion.

FanDuel and DraftKings spend $400 million per year on customer acquisition. Leagues that once banned betting now embrace it. We'll analyze why—and what risks come with that embrace."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "$120 BILLION Wagered | FanDuel Case Study"]**

---

**[1:30-2:00] CFL PROJECT CONNECTION**

**MATTHEW:**
"For your CFL Expansion Project, you'll build a sponsorship strategy for your market. Naming rights. Jersey sponsors. Category partners. The valuation frameworks you learn this week will shape your Milestone 3 deliverable.

## Week 3 Instructional Videos

### Video 11: Why Brands Pay - The Sponsorship Value Proposition (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Explain sponsorship economics
**Placement:** Module 2

**SCRIPT:**

**[0:00-0:15] HOOK**

**MATTHEW:**
Why does Coca-Cola pay FIFA hundreds of millions to sponsor the World Cup? Because 3.5 billion people watch it—but that's not the whole story.

---

**[0:15-0:45] RIGHTS FEES VS. ACTIVATION**

**MATTHEW:**
Sponsorship has two costs: **rights fees** and **activation costs**.

If Coke pays FIFA $300 million per year in rights, they'll spend $600-900 million in activation—ads, retail displays, hospitality. The rights fee is just the entry ticket. The real investment is 2-3× more.

---

**[0:45-1:15] WHAT SPONSORS GET**

**MATTHEW:**
In exchange, sponsors receive three things:

**One: Reach.** Logo exposure across broadcasts, stadiums, digital. The World Cup delivers 5 billion cumulative impressions.

**Two: Engagement.** Branded activations, hospitality, fan experiences.

**Three: Category exclusivity.** Coke blocks Pepsi. That exclusivity premium is worth 30-50% of the rights fee alone.

---

**[1:15-1:45] CPM BENCHMARK**

**MATTHEW:**
Brands measure sponsorship like advertising: **CPM**—cost per thousand impressions.

Super Bowl ads cost $7,000 CPM. NFL jersey sponsors pay $500-1,500 CPM. Why the discount?

**Frequency.** Fans see that jersey sponsor 20-30 times per season.

---

**[1:45-2:00] TRANSITION**

**MATTHEW:**
Next, use the **Sponsorship Valuation Calculator** to model real deals.

### Video 12: Sports Betting Regulatory Landscape (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Explain PASPA repeal and market growth
**Placement:** Module 3

**SCRIPT:**

**[0:00-0:15] HOOK**

**MATTHEW:**
In 2018, one Supreme Court decision unleashed a $100+ billion industry. Here's how sports betting transformed from illegal to mainstream.

---

**[0:15-0:45] PASPA REPEAL**

**MATTHEW:**
For 25 years, **PASPA** banned sports betting in 48 states. Only Nevada had legal sportsbooks.

In May 2018, the Supreme Court struck down PASPA. Within 5 years, **38 states** legalized.

---

**[0:45-1:15] MARKET GROWTH**

**MATTHEW:**
The numbers are staggering:

- **$119.8 billion** wagered in 2023
- **FanDuel and DraftKings** control 70% market share
- **90%** of bets placed on mobile
- Operators spend **$200-400 million** annually on customer acquisition

---

**[1:15-1:45] WHY LEAGUES EMBRACED BETTING**

**MATTHEW:**
Leagues initially opposed betting. Then embraced it for three reasons:

**One:** Betting partnerships deliver **$300+ million** in annual sponsorship revenue.

**Two:** Betting data feeds create new revenue—$50-100 million per year.

**Three:** Bettors watch **40% more games**. Betting drives engagement.

## Week 4 Introduction

### Video 13: Welcome to Week 4 - Athletes as Brands (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Orient students to Week 4, connect to Week 3 learning, preview key concepts
**Placement:** Module 0 (Bridge-In) - First video of Week 4
**Format:** Direct-to-camera SME presentation
**File:** `week4-introduction.mp4`

**SCRIPT:**

**[0:00-0:20] CONNECTION TO WEEK 3**

**MATTHEW:**
"Last week, you learned how brands invest in sports—sponsorships, activations, betting partnerships. You saw the frameworks that separate smart investments from vanity plays.

This week, we flip the lens. What happens when the ATHLETE becomes the brand?"

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Week 4: Athletes, Brands & Emerging Sports"]**

---

**[0:20-1:00] THE ATHLETE AS BRAND**

**MATTHEW:**
"Michael Jordan earned $93 million playing basketball. His net worth? $3.5 billion. The Jordan Brand generates $5 billion annually.

Serena Williams. LeBron James. Shohei Ohtani. The smartest athletes stopped asking 'How much will you pay me?' and started asking 'How much equity will you give me?'

Fees are finite. Equity compounds. That mindset shift separates millionaires from billionaires."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "$93M Salary → $3.5B Net Worth"]**

---

**[1:00-1:30] EMERGING OPPORTUNITIES**

**MATTHEW:**
"We'll also explore the fastest-growing segments in sports: women's sports, NIL, and emerging properties.

An NWSL team costs $75 million. An MLS team costs $700 million. Same fans, same stadiums. That valuation gap? It's not a market inefficiency—it's an investment opportunity."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "NWSL: $75M | MLS: $700M—What's the Real Value?"]**

---

**[1:30-2:00] CFL PROJECT CONNECTION**

**MATTHEW:**
"For your CFL Expansion Project, you'll identify athlete ambassadors and emerging partnerships for your market. Who becomes the face of CFL expansion? How do you attract talent to a new franchise?

## Week 4 Instructional Videos

### Video 14: The Five Revenue Streams of Athlete Wealth (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Introduce athlete revenue diversification
**Placement:** Module 3

**SCRIPT:**

**[0:00-0:15] HOOK**

**MATTHEW:**
LeBron James earned $480 million playing basketball. But he's worth $1.2 billion. Where did the other $720 million come from?

Athletes today aren't just players—they're brands.

---

**[0:15-0:45] THE FIVE REVENUE STREAMS**

**MATTHEW:**
Just like teams, athletes have five revenue streams:

**Stream 1: Salary and bonuses.** Your contract.
**Stream 2: Endorsements.** Brands pay for your name.
**Stream 3: Owned businesses.** Equity, not fees.
**Stream 4: Media and content.** Production companies, podcasts.
**Stream 5: Investments.** Smart capital allocation.

---

**[0:45-1:15] WHY DIVERSIFICATION MATTERS**

**MATTHEW:**
**Playing careers are short. Brands can last forever.**

The average NFL career is 3.3 years. The average NBA career is 4.5 years. But a well-built brand generates wealth for decades.

Michael Jordan earned $93 million playing. His Jordan Brand generates $5 billion annually. Net worth? $3.5 billion.

---

**[1:15-1:45] EQUITY VS. FEES**

**MATTHEW:**
**Equity compounds. Fees don't.**

Taking $1 million to endorse a brand? That's $1 million. Period.

Taking equity that grows 20% annually? Worth $38 million in 20 years.

Serena Williams, LeBron James, Michael Jordan—all shifted from fees to equity. That's why they're billionaires.

### Video 15: The Emerging Sports Opportunity (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Explain valuation gaps in women's sports and emerging markets
**Placement:** Module 3

**SCRIPT:**

**[0:00-0:15] HOOK**

**MATTHEW:**
An MLS team sells for $700 million. An NWSL team sells for $53 million. Same fans, same stadium, same game.

That's not a market inefficiency. That's an opportunity.

---

**[0:15-0:45] THE VALUATION GAP**

**MATTHEW:**
Emerging sports are massively undervalued:

- WNBA franchise: **$100-150 million** vs. NBA: **$3-4 billion**
- NWSL team: **$50-100 million** vs. MLS: **$500-800 million**
- Professional pickleball: **$5-15 million** vs. MLB: **$2+ billion**

These valuations reflect *history*, not *potential*.

---

**[0:45-1:15] WHY NOW?**

**MATTHEW:**
Three forces are closing the gap:

**One: Media investment.** WNBA's new deal is **$200 million per year**—a 300% increase.

**Two: Sponsorship surge.** Brands racing to associate before prices rise.

**Three: Attendance records.** Women's March Madness final: **18.9 million viewers**—more than the men's final.

---

**[1:15-1:45] THE INVESTMENT THESIS**

**MATTHEW:**
If an NWSL team bought for $75 million reaches 25% of MLS valuations in 10 years, that's a **$100+ million return**.

---

**[1:45-2:00] TRANSITION**

### Video 16: NIL and the New Athlete Economy (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Explain Name, Image, Likeness rules and impact
**Placement:** Module 3 or Module 4

**SCRIPT:**

**[0:00-0:15] HOOK**

**MATTHEW:**
In 2021, college athletes couldn't legally earn a dollar from their name. In 2024, they earned $1.17 billion through NIL deals.

The athlete economy changed overnight.

---

**[0:15-0:45] WHAT IS NIL?**

**MATTHEW:**
**NIL** stands for **Name, Image, and Likeness**—an athlete's right to profit from their personal brand.

Before July 2021, NCAA rules prohibited college athletes from earning money. Now they can sign endorsements, create content, sell merchandise.

---

**[0:45-1:15] THE NIL ECONOMY**

**MATTHEW:**
NIL spending has exploded:

- **$1.17 billion** total deals in 2024
- Top athletes earn **$1-5 million per year**
- **Women athletes over-index:** 2× their male counterparts in NIL per follower

Why? Social media engagement. Brands discovered college women athletes have higher engagement rates.

**[1:15-1:45] WHAT THIS MEANS**

**MATTHEW:**
For marketers, NIL creates new opportunities:

**Opportunity:** Access to athletes earlier, at lower costs. A $50,000 NIL deal can deliver better ROI than a $5 million pro deal.

**Risk:** Unregulated market. No standard contracts, no compliance infrastructure.

---

**[1:45-2:00] TRANSITION**

**MATTHEW:**
NIL is reshaping how athletes build brands from day one. Next, apply these concepts to the Serena Williams case study.

**File:** `week5-introduction.mp4`

**SCRIPT:**

**[0:00-0:20] CONNECTION TO WEEK 4**

**MATTHEW:**
"Last week, you explored athletes as brands and emerging sports opportunities. You saw how equity thinking transforms careers—and how undervalued properties create investment opportunities.

This final week, we zoom out. What's the future of sports business?"

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Week 5: Legacy, Culture & Future"]**

**[0:20-1:00] THE HERITAGE PARADOX**

**MATTHEW:**
"The Hockey Hall of Fame houses a century of memories. Fenway Park is a cathedral. The Masters jacket is sacred.

But visitors are declining. Cord-cutters don't watch full games. Gen Z consumes highlights, not broadcasts.

How do you honor tradition while adapting to survive? That's the heritage paradox—and it applies to every sports property."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Tradition vs. Innovation—Can You Have Both?"]**

---

**[1:00-1:30] THE MEGATRENDS**

**MATTHEW:**
"We'll also explore six megatrends reshaping the industry: AI-powered personalization, immersive VR/AR experiences, direct-to-consumer models, demographic shifts, betting integration, and sustainability.

Some trends will amplify each other. Some will conflict. The winners will be those who anticipate which forces matter most."

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "AI | VR/AR | D2C | Demographics | Betting | Sustainability"]**

---

**[1:30-2:00] FINAL PROJECT**

## Week 5 Instructional Videos

### Video 18: Heritage Properties as Business Assets (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Introduce heritage property economics
**Placement:** Module 3

**SCRIPT:**

**[0:00-0:15] HOOK**

**MATTHEW:**
The Hockey Hall of Fame houses 100 years of history. But visitors are declining 8% per year.

How do you monetize history without compromising authenticity?

---

**[0:15-0:45] THE HERITAGE PROPERTY CHALLENGE**

**MATTHEW:**
Heritage properties include halls of fame, historic venues like Fenway Park, and legacy events like The Masters.

They share a unique constraint: **Aggressive commercialization destroys the authenticity that makes them valuable.**

Add a Jumbotron to Fenway? Fans revolt. Turn the Hall of Fame into a theme park? You lose credibility.

---

**[0:45-1:15] THE REVENUE MODEL**

**MATTHEW:**
Heritage properties generate revenue from:

1. **Admissions (40-50%)**
2. **Events (20-30%)**
3. **Retail (10-15%)**
4. **Sponsorships (10-15%)**
5. **Digital/Media (5-10%)**

The challenge? **Admissions are declining.** Younger generations visit museums less. Digital alternatives compete for attention.

---

**[1:15-1:45] THE INNOVATION IMPERATIVE**

**MATTHEW:**
Heritage properties face a choice:

**Preserve:** Maintain tradition. Accept declining attendance.

**Transform:** Embrace digital, virtual experiences, global expansion. Risk alienating traditionalists.

The Hockey Hall of Fame is testing virtual tours, esports, and pop-up exhibits internationally.

---

**[1:45-2:00] TRANSITION**

**MATTHEW:**
Next, use the **Legacy vs Innovation Matrix** to map strategic decisions.

**[END: 2:00]**

### Video 19: The Legacy vs Innovation Trade-Off (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Explain the strategic framework
**Placement:** Module 3

**SCRIPT:**

**[0:00-0:15] HOOK**

**MATTHEW:**
The Masters bans cell phones and changes nothing. The Olympics add breakdancing and esports.

Both are heritage properties. Both are successful. They made different strategic choices.

---

**[0:15-0:45] THE FOUR QUADRANTS**

**MATTHEW:**
Every heritage strategy falls into one of four quadrants:

**Quadrant 1: Purist** (High Tradition, Low Growth)
Protect authenticity above all. Examples: Augusta National, Wimbledon.

**Quadrant 2: Innovator** (Low Tradition, High Growth)
Aggressively modernize. Examples: UFC, Formula E.

**Quadrant 3: Stagnant** (Low Tradition, Low Growth)
The danger zone. Lost identity AND lost revenue.

**Quadrant 4: Balanced** (High Tradition, High Growth)
The sweet spot. Examples: NFL, Premier League.

---

**[0:45-1:15] FINDING THE BALANCE**

**MATTHEW:**
**There's no single right answer.** Ask three questions:

**One:** What's our irreplaceable core?
**Two:** What's negotiable?
**Three:** What would destroy our credibility?

---

**[1:15-1:45] REAL EXAMPLES**

**MATTHEW:**
**The Masters:** Core = Azalea fairways, green jackets. Innovation = App, live streaming. Result: $200+ million revenue, brand intact.

**Olympics:** Core = Opening ceremony, athlete stories. Innovation = New sports, social media. Result: Record engagement, ongoing debates.

**[1:45-2:00] TRANSITION**

**MATTHEW:**
Next, use the **Heritage Property Analyzer** to model transformation scenarios.

### Video 20: Future Trends in Sports Business (2 minutes)

**Purpose:** Introduce emerging trends
**Placement:** Module 3

**SCRIPT:**

**[0:00-0:15] HOOK**

**MATTHEW:**
In 1995, you watched sports on TV or in person. By 2035, you might watch from inside a virtual stadium, bet on every play, and interact with AI commentators.

---

**[0:15-1:00] THE SIX MEGATRENDS**

**MATTHEW:**
Six megatrends are reshaping sports business:

**1. AI and Machine Learning:** Personalized highlights, AI coaching, automated content.

**2. Immersive Technology (VR/AR):** Virtual attendance, augmented broadcasts.

**3. Direct-to-Consumer Everything:** Leagues bypassing networks. Athletes selling directly to fans.

**4. Demographic Shifts:** Gen Z watches highlights, not full games. Women's sports reaching parity.

**5. Sports Betting Integration:** Real-time betting woven into broadcasts.

**6. Climate and Sustainability:** Carbon-neutral stadiums, sustainable merchandise.

---

**[1:00-1:45] WHAT THIS MEANS**

**MATTHEW:**
For sports marketers:

- **Media rights** valued on engagement, not just eyeballs
- **Sponsorship** requires data integration, not just logos
- **Fan experience** blends physical and digital
- **New properties** may leapfrog traditional ones

---

**[1:45-2:00] TRANSITION**

**MATTHEW:**
Next, use the **Future Trends Simulator** to forecast how these trends impact sports business over 5-10 years.
